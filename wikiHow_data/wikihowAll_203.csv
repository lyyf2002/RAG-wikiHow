Weigh the garment to determine how much dye to use.,
Wash the garment prior to dyeing.,
Consider tying the garment up if you want to tie dye.,
Bring 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water to boil in a large pot on your stovetop.,
Pour one bottle of DyeMore into the pot of water once it is simmering.,
Test the color on a scrap of white cotton fabric.,
Dip the garment into the dye bath.Stir the garment slowly and continuously in the dye bath for at least 30 minutes.,
Remove the garment from the dye bath when it reaches your desired color.,
Rinse the garment under warm water.,
Wash the garment again in warm, soapy water.Rinse the garment when you are done washing it.,
Wrap the garment in an old towel to remove excess moisture.,
Hang the garment to dry.",How to Dye Polyester1," Generally speaking, one bottle of DyeMore can dye up to two pounds of fabric.Dyeing very light clothing or very dark clothing will require at least one additional bottle, so be prepared if this is the case for you.
Polyester may require a second bottle of DyeMore, because of its synthetic makeup.
The darker color you want at the end, the more dye you will need.;
, This helps to remove finishes that might inhibit the absorption of the dye. Use warm, soapy water to wash.Use a sink or small tub for smaller items, such as scarves and short-sleeved shirts.
Use a larger bucket or tub for bulkier items, such as long-sleeved shirts, jackets, and pants.

, You can create different patterns, such as rosettes, sunbursts, swirls, and so forth. Here are some ideas to get you started:

For a simple, crumpled look, crumple your garment into a ball and secure it with a few, large rubber bands.
For a banded effect, twist your garment into a rope, then tie some rubber bands around the rope. Keep the rubber bands several inches apart.
To create a sunburst or swirl: pinch the center of your garment (such as shirt or handkerchief) and twist it. Keep twisting and turning the fabric until you get a shape like a cinnamon roll. Secure the garment by wrapping a few rubber bands around it.

, Because of the challenge in dyeing polyester, using a stovetop method is recommended because the dye process needs hotter temperatures in order to work.Once the large pot is filled with 3 gallons (11.36 liters) of water, cover the pot and turn the burner to high. Heat the water to almost boiling.
Using a cooking thermometer will be helpful, as the dye process requires a steady temperature of about 180°F (82.3°C). The thermometer will ensure that you keep the water at that temperature.

, Shake the bottle of DyeMore before adding it to the pot to make sure that the dye is incorporated. In addition to the bottle of DyeMore, add 1 teaspoon of dish washing liquid and use a large spoon to stir the mixture well.If your fabric is white, and you want to dye it a lighter, pastel color, start with half a bottle of DyeMore. It is easier to add more dye later.
If you plan on dyeing your fabric more than one color, pour in your lightest color first. You will need to do a separate dye bath for the other color(s).

, This helps you to see if the dye is the shade you would like.If it is too light, then add some more dye to the mixture. You may need to add up to one more bottle. Test the color with a new scrap of white cotton fabric.
If the color is too dark, then add more water. Then, test the color again with a new scrap of white cotton fabric.
If you decide to add more dye, remember to shake the second bottle before pouring it in.

, In order for the color to take fully in the clothing, polyester requires at least this amount of time in the dye bath. Use tongs to lift and move the clothing around in the pot. Wear rubber gloves to do this so that you do not dye your skin.


If you plan on dyeing all of your fabric, dip it all the way into the dye bath. It should be completely submerged.
If you plan on dyeing only part of the fabric, then dip it in only part way. Consider draping the rest of the fabric over the edge of the container.
Keep the garment in the dye bath even if it has reached your desired color in less than 30 minutes. The color can rinse from the fabric if it is not given enough time to set in the fabric, which will make it lighter than you desired.

, Squeeze out excess dye over the pot full of the dye bath. Be sure to keep the rubber gloves on during this time, as the dye will still stain your skin. Remember that as the clothing dries, the shade of the color will lighten.If you wrapped rubber bands around your garment to tie dye it, carefully cut those rubber bands off with a pair of scissors., While you rinse, gradually make the water cooler. Continue to rinse the article of clothing until the water runs clear.If you want to add more colors to your garment, then you can dip it into another dye bath after you rinse it. Be sure to rinse your garment after each dye bath.

, This will remove any last remnants of excess dye.

, Spread an old towel out on the floor, and align the bottom of your garment with the bottom of the towel. Roll the garment and towel together into a tube. Press down on the towel tube gently and squeeze. Try to get out as much moisture as you can.

If you have a very large, bulky item, you may need to do this step a few more times with a fresh towel. Bulky items soak up more water than lightweight items.

, Place the hanger in a place where there is a lot of airflow, such as on a balcony. If this is not possible for you, hang it in the bathroom and turn the fan on. Be sure to place some newspaper or old towels beneath the garment to catch any drips. There is a small change that the garment still have some dye in it.

Use a regular hanger to hang shirts and jackets.
Use a pants hanger, or a hanger with clips, to hang pants, shirts, scarves, and handkerchiefs. Avoid draping the fabric over anything while it dries.

Get a pair of buttons.,
Prep the buttons, if needed.,
Use a pair of wire cutters to cut the top part off of a paperclip.,
Glue the cut piece to the back of the button.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Twist open the loop on your earring hook using a pair of pliers.,
Slip the loop over the paperclip, then twist it back shut.,
Repeat the process for the other button.",How to Make Button Earrings2," You can use plain 2-hole or 4-hole buttons for this. You can also use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, or even fabric-covered buttons.

, If you are using 2-hole or 4-hole buttons, you do not need to prep them. If you are using a coat-style button, or any other style of button that has a loop on the back, you will need to cut the loop off with a pair of wire cutters.When you are done, use a piece of fine-grit sand paper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges.

, This will create the loop for your earring to hook on to. It needs to be a little bit shorter than the button itself.Alternatively, you can use a small piece of gold or silver wire, and then bent it into a narrow U-shape. Be sure to match the color of your wire to your earring hook. For example, if your earring hook is gold, you should use gold wire.

, Make sure that the top part of the paperclip is sticking out over the edge of the button. It does not need to stick out by much—just enough so that you can thread your earring hook through.The best type of glue to use for this would be a thick, industrial-strength or epoxy glue. If you are using a basic 2-hole or 4-hole button, however, super glue may also work.

, If you move on too soon, the next step might weaken the paperclip loop, and cause it to break off.

, Do not pull the loop apart, as this may distort it.

, When slipping the earring hook on, making sure that it is facing the right, otherwise, your earrings will be backwards when you put them on!

, Once you can done this, your earrings are ready to wear!

Get a fabric-covered button-making kit.,
Use a pair of pliers to pull the metal loop out of the button back.If you can't pull the metal loop out, you can cut it off using a pair of wire cutters instead.,
Use the template to trace a circle onto your fabric.You will need one circle for each button that you are making.,
Cut your fabric out using a pair of fabric scissors.,
Hand stitch along the edges of the circle.,
Place the fabric right-side-down into the button maker.,
Place the button cap on top of the fabric, smooth-side-down.,
Pull on the thread to gather the fabric.,
Push the back of the button in place.,
Glue an earring post to the back of your button.Place a glob of super glue, epoxy glue, or industrial-strength glue onto the back of your earring post, then press the earring post onto the back of your button.,
Wait for the glue to dry before wearing your earrings.",How to Make Button Earrings3," These kits usually include a set or two of metal buttons as well as two plastic pieces. These plastic pieces are meant to help you put your buttons together.Save the packaging! It usually has a template for the fabric.

, Set the button backs aside when you are done.

, If your kit did not come with a template, or if you accidentally threw it away, draw a circle roughly twice the size of your button top.


Some templates are shaped like a semi-circle. In this case, fold your fabric in half, and place the straight edge of the semi-circle along the fold.
The best fabric to use for this is cotton fabric. It can be plain or patterned.

, Try to be as neat as you can. Because of the small size you are working in, any small mistakes will have a big effect on the final product.

, This will make assembling the button easier. Be sure to leave a long tail of thread and the needle still attached so that you can pull on it to gather the fabric later.

, This is the larger of the two plastic pieces. Try to center the fabric as much as possible.

, Push it down until it rests firmly inside the button maker.

, The fabric should now be gathered around the inside of the button. Stitch in place a few times, then tie the thread off into a knot, and snip it. This will keep the fabric in place for the next step.

, If you need to, place the button cover tool (the other piece from your button making kit) on top, then tap it firmly with a hammer. Lift the button cover tool away when you are done.

If you don't have pierced ears, use clip-on earring backings instead.

, How long the glue takes to dry depends on the type of glue you are using. Some only take a few minutes to dry, while others require a few hours. Refer to your glue bottle for specific drying times. Once the glue has dried, your earrings are ready to wear!

Clean the garment to prepare it for dyeing.,
Tie the garment up with rubber bands if you want to tie dye.,
Dissolve the disperse dye in 1 cup of boiling water.,
Dilute 2 tablespoons of dye carrier in 1 cup of boiling water and stir.,
Fill a large pot with 2 gallons (7.57 liters) of water and bring it to 120°F (48.89°C) on the stovetop.,
Add the pre-washed garment to the dye bath.,
Bring the dye bath to a rapid boil.,
Once it reaches a boil, simmer the dye bath and stir intermittently for 30-45 minutes.,
Heat a second pot of water to 180°F (82.3°C) while you simmer the dye bath.,
Discard the dye bath and refill the pot with water at 160°F (71.2°C).,
Rinse the garment thoroughly in hot water.",How to Dye Polyester2," There are two methods you can use for this, but it is important to clean the fabric in order to get it ready to absorb the disperse dye.


Put the garment through a cycle in the washing machine on the hottest setting with ½ teaspoon of soda ash and ½ teaspoon of Synthrapol. The Synthrapol helps to clean and prepare the garment for dyeing.
Wash the garment by hand on the stovetop with ½ teaspoon of soda ash and ½ teaspoon of Synthrapol.

, You can create different patterns, such as rosettes, sunbursts, swirls, and so on. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

For a simple, rippled look, crumple your garment into a ball and wrap a few, large rubber bands around it to hold it together.
For a banded effect, twist your garment into a rope and wrap some rubber bands around the rope. Keep the rubber bands several inches apart.
To create a sunburst or swirl, pinch the center of your garment (such as shirt or handkerchief) and twist it. Keep twisting and turning until you get a shape like a cinnamon roll. Wrap a few rubber bands around the ""bun"" to hold it together.

, Stir the dye powder into the boiling water, and then allow it to cool to room temperature. Once it has cooled, stir it again. Then, strain through two layers of nylon stockings before adding it to the dye bath. Depending on how light or dark you want to dye your polyester garment, there are different amounts of dye powder to use. Here are a few combinations to get you started:


Pale/pastel: ¼ teaspoon
Medium: ¾ teaspoon
Dark: 3 teaspoons
Black: 6 teaspoons

, Dye carrier is necessary to achieve dark colors, but it is optional for pale or medium colors. You will add this diluted dye carrier to the dye bath later on.

, Add the following ingredients in the order they are given once the water reaches the correct temperature. Stir the mixture after you add each ingredient.


½ teaspoon Synthrapol
1 teaspoon citric acid or 11 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
Diluted dye carrier mixture, if using
¾ teaspoon Metaphos, which is optional unless you have hard water
Dissolved and strained disperse dye

, Stir the full mixture together one last time before adding the garment to it.

, Stir the mixture constantly while it comes to a boil. Be careful so as not to crease the fabric too much. If you do this, the dye job may not be even at the end.

, The longer you let it sit, the darker the color will be. Remember to be gentle while you stir so that the fabric does not crease and the dye takes onto all of the garment evenly., When the garment reaches your preferred shade or color, remove it from the dye bath and transfer it to this second pot of heated water.


Make sure that the temperature is at 180°F (82.3°C), because temperatures below this will result in an odd odor and residue on the garment.
Be sure to fully submerge the garment in the water in order to rinse it.

, You are going to make a mixture to wash the fabric again before it dries.


Add ½ teaspoon of Synthrapol to the water and stir.
Transfer the dyed garment from the rinse pot to this pot. Stir intermittently for 5-10 minutes.

, Once the water runs clear, remove excess moisture by wrapping it in a towel or wringing it out.


Smell the garment once it is rinsed and wrung out. If it still smells like the dye carrier, then repeat steps 7 and 8 above to better remove it.
If the garment has no odor, then hang it to dry.
If you wrapped rubber bands around your garment to tie dye it, cut rubber bands off before you go to rinse it.

;
, This can be something you sketched, an image you saw online, lyrics from your favorite song, or even a picture of your favorite celebrity. Visualize where and how you will put this on the t-shirt. Will it be on the front, back, or both? Will it be centered? Will it continue onto the sleeves? If necessary, make a sketch of a t-shirt showing the design so you can get a sense of the balance and proportion.








, This project tends to be messy and can ruin nice clothing.








, Find a well-ventilated area (working outdoors or in a room with more than one open window will do) and spread newspaper out where you will be working. Spread your shirt out on the newspaper and place the cardboard inside of the shirt.








, Never use both at the same time; doing so can produce toxic fumes that cause permanent damage to your brain. Open your chosen product and pour just enough so that it barely fills the bottom of your cup. Tightly replace the lid and remove it from your work area.








, Remember that synthetic brushes will dissolve into bleach so be careful.








, The design may not appear at first, but after your first few strokes, watch as it slowly fades in. You can stop and wash the bleach out before it completely fades if you wish.








, Put your shirt into the washing machine without any other clothes or detergent. If you don't have a washing machine available, rinse thoroughly in the sink. Dry as usual.









For the first few washes, make sure that you only wash the shirt by itself.

, If any bleach remains in the cap, pour it down the sink and let the water run for a few seconds. If any toilet bowl cleaner remains, pour it into the toilet and flush.

Prepare the dye mix.,
Soak the nylon.,
Make the dye bath.,
Add the nylon.,
Add vinegar.,
Stir while dyeing.,
Rinse the nylon in hot water.,
Dry the material.",How to Dye Nylon1," Bottles of liquid dye should be vigorously shaken before use. Powdered dyes must be dissolved in warm water.


Mix the dye in a disposable plastic bucket or in a stainless steel container. Porcelain and fiberglass can get stained, so it is best to avoid using a container made from one of these materials. Plastic can also stain, so only use a plastic container you can dispose of later.
Follow the manufacturer's instructions to determine how much dye and water to use. Typically, you will use one package of powder dye or a half bottle of liquid dye for every 1 lb (450 g) of fabric or less.






When dissolving one package of powder dye, you will need to dissolve it in 2 cups (500 ml) of water.





;
, Place the nylon inside a large saucepan or stockpot and cover it with lukewarm water. Place this pot on the stove and heat on medium until the water reaches a temperature of about 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius).Typically, you will need to have 3 gallons (12 L) of water for every 1 lb (450 g) of fabric.






Take the nylon out of the water once it reaches the temperature noted above. Set the material aside for now.







, Add the prepared dye to the water in your saucepan. Stir well to distribute the dye evenly throughout the water.

, Submerge the nylon in the dye bath. Stir gently for several minutes while the dye bath continues to heat over a medium temperature on the stove.


Make sure that the material does not get tangled as it soaks in the dye bath. Tangles can cause the nylon to dye unevenly, creating unsightly splotches. To prevent tangles, stir gently and slowly. You should also avoid overcrowding the saucepan.

, Once the water begins to simmer, add a little vinegar to the dye bath. White vinegar can help the dye set into the fibers of the nylon.


Use 1 cup (250 ml) of white vinegar for every 1 lb (450 g) of nylon or 3 gallons (12 L) of water.You should wait at least five minutes before adding the vinegar to the dye bath, even if the water begins simmering before that point. If you add the vinegar too quickly, the dye may not soak into the nylon evenly.
While adding the vinegar, you can also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid laundry detergent. Doing so will also help ensure even dyeing.

, Allow the nylon to sit in the warm dye bath for at least 20 minutes. Gently stir the material as it soaks to promote even dyeing.


Allow the water to continue simmering until it reaches a temperature of 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). Most dyes are activated by heat, and the temperature of the dye bath will need to be at least this hot if you want to produce a strong color. Once the water reaches this heat, you can turn the heat source off.
The longer the nylon soaks, the deeper the color will be. You can leave the nylon in the dye bath for up to 1 hour.
You'll need to stir the material in the dye bath on a fairly constant basis.

, Take the material out of the dye bath and transfer it to a sink or large bucket. Rinse the material with hot water several times.


The water should be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). Hot water is necessary in order to rinse out excess dye, but it should not remove dye that has already set into the fabric.
Change the water every few minutes to help the dye wash out. Continue doing this until the water remains clear after submerging the dyed nylon.
Alternatively, you could rinse the nylon under hot running water. Continue doing so until the water runs clear.

, Allow the nylon to air dry. Once it feels completely dry, the nylon should be ready to use.

"
"
Soak the nylon.,
Mix the dye bath.,
Dunk the nylon in the dye bath.,
Heat the bath.,
Add vinegar.,
Cool the dye bath.,
Rinse the nylon.,
Let the nylon dry.",How to Dye Nylon2," Place the nylon in a bucket and cover it with lukewarm water. Allow it to soak overnight, or for at least eight hours.


Soaking the nylon makes it easier for the dye to penetrate its fibers, and a long soak will ensure that the fibers are evenly drenched. With chemical dyes, warm to hot water is necessary, but room temperature water will suffice for food coloring dye.

, Add warm water to a large saucepan or stockpot until it is one-half to two-thirds full. Mix your chosen food coloring into this water, stirring until evenly combined.


Make sure that you have a large enough pot and enough water for the amount of nylon being dyed. Test the pot size before you add the water by stuffing the nylon inside. The nylon fill no more than one-quarter of the pot.
You will need about 1 qt (1 L) of water for every 1/4 lb (110 g) or less of nylon. For instance, if you are dyeing one pair of nylon stockings, 1 qt (1 L) of water will usually suffice.
The right amount of food coloring can be tricky to determine. For a vibrant color, you will need at least 10 drops for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water. Vary the amount as desired to lighten or deepen the shade.

, Add the nylon to the dye bath, making sure that it is completely submerged. The dye bath must be allowed to soak into all the fibers of the material.


Stir the nylon as it sits in the dye bath. You will need to stir it almost constantly throughout the entire dyeing process if you want to maintain an even color.

, Place the saucepan on the stove and heat it on medium until the dye bath reaches a temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius).The dyeing process is almost always triggered by heat, no matter what kind of dye you use. If you want the dye to be its brightest and most vibrant, this is the minimum temperature you will need the dye bath to reach. Do not allow the dye bath to reach a rolling boil, however.

, Pour a little white vinegar into the dye bath, mixing it in gently. Vinegar will help the color set into the nylon.


The amount of vinegar also varies based on the amount of water you use. As a general rule, use 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of white vinegar for every 1 cup (250 ml) of water in your dye bath., Turn the heat source off and remove the pan from the stove. Allow it to sit until the dye bath cools to room temperature. Do not remove the nylon during this time.


The water will be close to clear when the nylon is done dyeing. If you do not notice a change in the color of the water after 20 to 30 minutes, place the pan back on the stove and heat it again to reactivate the dyeing process.

, Take the nylon to a large sink and rinse it under warm, running water until the water runs clear., Gently squeeze the excess water out the material using your hands, but do not wring the material out since doing so can damage the fibers. Allow the nylon to sit out flat or hang in a warm location with good air circulation until fully dry.


You may need to gently stretch the nylon as it dries if you want the material to lie flat. If you allow the nylon to dry without stretching it, the end result will likely have wrinkles.

"
"
Soak the material.,
Combine the mix with warm water.,
Add the nylon.,
Heat the dye bath.,
Prepare a rinse with water and vinegar.,
Rinse the nylon.,
Dry the nylon.",How to Dye Nylon3," Place the nylon in a bowl of warm water and allow it to soak for 20 to 30 minutes.


Pre-soaking the nylon will make it easier for the dye to penetrate its fibers. As a result, the dye will soak into the material more evenly, resulting in a more level color.

, Pour 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of boiling water into a microwave-safe container. Add one packet of powdered drink mix to this water, stirring until the powder is dissolved.This process is only suited to small batches of nylon—for instance, one or two pairs of nylon stockings. Do not use it if you have more than 1/4 lb (110 g) of nylon to dye.
You'll need a container that can hold roughly 1 qt (1 L) of water for 1/4 lb (110 g) of nylon or less. Do not use a smaller container even if you have less nylon. If you have to bunch up or crowd the nylon inside the container, it may not dye evenly.

, Place the nylon in the dye bath, pushing it down with a spoon or similar utensil until all of the material has been submerged.


Since the nylon should still be heavy with moisture from your pre-soaking step, it should sink to the bottom of your container instead of floating on top of the water. The entire piece of nylon must be submerged throughout the process if you want it to dye properly.

, Place the container in your microwave, nylons and all. Microwave on full power for 1 minute. Stir gently, then let it rest for another 1 to 2 minutes. Repeat the process as needed, microwaving and stirring the nylon as it sits in the bath, until the dye has been absorbed.


Gradually, the nylon should begin to absorb the dye. When this happens, the material will look brighter and the water will look clearer. The entire process will usually take three to six rounds of microwaving.

, Fill a large bowl with cool water and add a capful of white vinegar, mixing the latter in well.


The vinegar should help the color set.
If you are unable to measure by the capful, use measuring spoons to measure out 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of vinegar per 2 cups (5 ml) of water.

, Remove the nylon from the dye bath and gently squeeze out the excess water without wringing the fabric. Soak the nylon in the prepared rinse to remove the dye.


You may need to dump the water and refill the bowl several times. Eventually, the rinse water should appear clear. That's when you'll know that all of the excess dye has been washed out.

, Gently squeeze out any excess moisture, then hang the nylon up and allow it to air dry.

"
"
Assemble materials.,
Before you start protect or remove any items you don't accidentally want to dye.,
Dump powdered drink mix into container.,
Add your fabric to the hot water and watch carefully.,
Every 15 minutes or so agitate your item, and start to check the color.,
If you want to deepen color, add another packet of drink mix that has been dissolved in a cup of hot water to dye bath.

,
When desired shade is reached, a shade or two deeper than what you ultimately desire, allow washing machine to finish it's cycle.

,
If your item can stand it, tumble dry.,
The first time you wear or use your item, be careful, as some color may transfer.

,
Be sure to clean washing machine after dyeing in it.

",How to Dye Fibers with Kool Aid or Other Powdered Drink Mix," The exact amount of drink mix or gelatin mix required depends on desired color saturation. One packet to approximately one pound (half a kilogram) of material is a good start.Your fabric item should be made from natural fibers, like cotton. It will work best on animal based fibers like silk and wool. Plant fibers, such as cotton and linen, will yield light, muted colors.Man-made fibers like polyester will not take or hold dye. Cotton/Polyester blends can be dyed, but will produce a mottled (heathered) effect.;
, This may mean putting on gloves to prevent dyeing your hands, an apron to avoid staining your clothing, and putting down plastic over carpeting or furniture.

, Add about a cup (250 ml) of of very hot water to powder, mix well. Once mix is completely dissolved, pour this mix into the washing machine. Start washing machine cycle using hot water.

, Be sure to stop the cycle once item is covered completely with water. Use stick to poke item and make sure it's completely submerged. Sometimes air bubbles will keep items afloat.

, Try to wring out a corner so you see color of item, not color of dye bath. Colors will lighten significantly after rinsing and when dry.

,,, If drip drying be sure to protect area below item in case it drips.

Remove the tea bags from their packaging and cut off the strings.,
Boil a large pot of water with salt in it.,
Allow the tea to steep in the water.,
Wash or wet the fabric.,
Remove the tea bags and add the fabric.,
Soak the fabric in the tea for at least an hour.,
Rinse and soak the fabric in cold water and vinegar.,
Wring out the excess water and dry the fabric.,
Iron the fabric.",How to Dye Fabric With Tea," To prepare the tea, unwrap the tea bags and discard the packaging. Use a pair of scissors to remove the strings, and throw those away as well.Black tea works best for dyeing fabric because it has the deepest color. Teas that are light in color, such as white or green teas, don't work as well.
You can also use loose tea to dye your fabric if you prefer. However, keep in mind that the process is less messy if you use tea bags.
The number of tea bags that you’ll need depends on how large the fabric you’re dyeing is and how dark you want the fabric to become. You need to use enough water to cover the fabric, so the more water that you use, the more tea bags you’ll likely need.
In most cases, you can assume that you’ll need one tea bag for every cup or 237 milliliters (8  fl oz) of water that you’re using. Keep in mind that you’ll want to add extra bags if you want your fabric to be a darker color.;
, Fill a large pot with enough water to cover your fabric and allow it to move freely. Mix in some table salt, and place the pot on the stove.Turn the heat to high, and bring the water to a full boil.In general, you’ll want to use 4 cups or 1 liter (0.26 US gal) of water for every yard or meter of fabric that you’re dyeing.Adding the salt to the water will help set the color in the fabric so it won’t come out as easily when you wash the items.
Use 2 tablespoons of salt for every 4 cups or 1 liter (0.26 US gal) of water that you’re using.

, Once the water comes to a boil, remove the pot from the heat, and place the tea bags inside. Let the them soak in the water until the color comes out of the tea. In most cases, you’ll want to allow the tea to steep for at least 15 minutes.The longer that you allow the tea to soak, the more color will come out and the darker your dyed fabric will be. Keep checking on the water to see if you’re happy with the color before you add the fabric.

, The fabric that you’re dyeing should be wet when you dye it. Wash pre-used fabric to remove any stains or dirt. If you’re using new fabric, rinse it in water before dyeing. Be sure to wring out the fabric before dyeing it.Tea dyeing will only work on natural fibers, such as cotton, silk, linen, and wool. It won't work on synthetic fabric, such as polyester.
While you should wring out the fabric before dyeing it, don’t allow it to dry completely.

, When your tea has reached the desired color, carefully lift all of the tea bags from the water and discard them. Place the wet fabric in the tea water, making sure that it’s completely submerged.It may help to swirl the fabric around with a wooden spoon or other stirring instrument to ensure that it rests at the bottom of the pot and completely under the water.
Some areas of the fabric may start popping up in the water. Use other spoons or kitchen tools to hold the fabric down.

, Once all of the fabric is submerged in the tea bath, allow it to soak for at least 60 minutes. Keep in mind that the longer that you leave the fabric in the tea, the darker it will be dyed.To ensure that the fabric is dyed a very noticeable color, you may want to soak in the tea overnight.
It’s a good idea to gently stir or agitate the fabric in the tea bath every so often while it’s soaking. That will help ensure that it dyes evenly.
You can lift the fabric out of the tea at regular intervals to see how dark it has become. However, be aware that the fabric will dry lighter than it appears when wet so you may need to continue soaking it longer than you might think.

, Once you’re happy with the fabric’s color, remove it from the tea bath. Give it a quick rinse in cold water, and then allow it to soak for 10 minutes in a pot of cold water. Add a splash of vinegar to the water to help set the color.If you’re bothered by the tea scent of the fabric, you may want to handwash it with laundry detergent meant for delicate items to remove the smell.

, After the fabric has soaked in the cold water and vinegar mixture, remove it from the pot and wring out the excess water. Lay the fabric out flat in a warm, sunny spot, and allow it to dry completely.Depending on the type of fabric that you’re dyeing, you may want to throw the fabric in the dryer instead of air drying it.

, The fabric can wrinkle easily when it’s placed in the pot to dye, and because you’re laying it flat to dry, the wrinkles won’t be removed during the drying process. It’s a good idea to iron the fabric to smoothen it and give it a more attractive appearance.Take the fabric type into account before ironing it. While durable fabrics such as cotton and linen hold up well to heat, a delicate material such as silk needs to be handled more gently. Heavy wool requires the steam setting. Consult the instruction manual for your iron to determine the best setting for your fabric.

Hang the curtains up.",How to Dye Curtains," Most natural fabrics can be dyed without a problem, but many synthetic fabrics do not accept dye quite as easily. Before you begin this project, you should make sure that your curtains are made with a material capable of being dyed.


Note that some dyes may or may not be capable of coloring different types of materials, but most of them have the same abilities and limitations. Nonetheless, you should check the label of the dye you plan to use to verify that it can handle your fabric type.
Most dyes will color cotton, linen, wool, silk, and ramie. Certain synthetic fibers, like rayon and nylon, are usually dyeable, as well.
Most dyes will not color fabrics primarily composed of polyester, acrylic, acetate, fiberglass, spandex, or metallic fibers. Bleached fabrics, waterproof fabrics, stain resistant fabrics, and ""dry clean only"" fabrics are usually off limits, as well.;
, Regardless of whether the curtains are new or old, you should run them through a standard washing cycle before you dye them. Allow the curtains to partially dry by air drying them or using a dryer.


You should use laundry detergent, but do not use fabric softeners.
This pre-washing step helps remove any finishes or grime that could otherwise interfere with the way the fabric absorbs dye. As a result, pre-washed curtains will absorb dye more evenly and more accurately.
The curtains do not need to be completely dry, but you should not allow them to remain soaked, either, since the moisture in the curtains can turn cold and negatively affect the way the dye interacts with the material later on.

, Determine what color you want to dye your curtains. For the most part, all you really need to do is figure out what hue you want and find the color concentrate that best matches it. You can alter the shade—or, how dark or light the color becomes—by leaving the curtains in your dye for a longer or shorter period of time.


Do a little research before buying your dye.Read reviews for each color under consideration and look at pictures. Figuring out the exact right choice can be difficult, but you can minimize the risk of choosing an unsatisfactory color by taking the time to check into each option.

, If your curtains are white, off white, or a very light color, you should be able to dye them without any problem. If your curtains are a darker or brighter color, though, you should use dye remover beforehand.


Use dye remover instead of bleach since bleach can make it difficult for fabrics to absorb dye.
A dark fabric cannot be dyed a lighter color. You might be able to dye a colored fabric if your dye is a darker hue, but the results will be a blend of the dye and the color already on your curtains. Since the results can be unpredictable, completely removing the original color is a safer approach.To use color remover:Fill your washing machine with hot water and add three to four packets of dye remover as the tub fills.
Place your still-wet, pre-washed curtains in the washer once the agitation cycle begins. Allow them to soak in the washer for 10 to 30 minutes, or until the color washes out.
Drain the washer.
Rewash the curtains with detergent. Use a full wash and rinse cycle.
Clean the washer with hot water and detergent before using it again to wash out all traces of the color remover.



, Dye amounts can vary by brand, so you should always check brand specifics before making your decision. The amounts are often comparable, though, and based on weight.


Weigh your curtains on a scale to determine how heavy they are. The easiest way to do this is to weight yourself, then weight yourself while holding the curtains. Subtract the difference to figure out the weight of the curtains.
As a general rule, you will need one box of powder dye or 1/2 cup (125 ml) liquid dye for every 1 lb (450 g) of weight. You can use less dye if you want a lighter shade. For a darker color, double this amount.

, As a general rule, you should use 3 gallons (12 L) of water for every 1 lb (450 g) of fabric.The water should be simmering hot when you pour it into the tub.


Glass and stainless steel will not be stained by the dye, but most plastics will become stained.
If you are worried about staining the tub, consider lining it with plastic sheets before filling it with water.
This works best if you are using a single tub. If you need to split the process up between two tubs, though, make sure that the amount of water and the amount of dye you add to each tub is exactly equal.
Alternatively, you could use your washing machine to dye the curtains. To do so, begin by filling the washing machine basin with the hottest water possible. The rest of the process will essentially follow the same steps.

, There are differences between liquid and powder dyes, and there may even be further differences between dye brands. Check the instructions on your dye to determine the best way to prepare it.


Usually, you will need to prepare a bottle of liquid dye by vigorously shaking it for a minute or so.
To prepare powder dye, fully dissolve one packet in 2 cups (500 ml) of very hot water., Dump your prepared dye into the filled basin or filled washing machine (whichever you decided to use). Use a paint stick or board to stir the dye in until you are certain that it has fully spread throughout the water.

, If the curtains are dry or cool to the touch, quickly soak them in a sink or separate tub filled with clean hot water.


Hot water helps activate the dye. Your results will be as pure and even as possible if both the dye bath and the curtains are hot when you transfer the material to the dye.

, Place the curtains in the dye bath, submerging them completely beneath the water's surface. Allow them to sit in the hot dye for 5 minutes.


Do not stir or agitate the curtains during this time. If you are using a washing machine, do not start any sort of washing cycle yet.

, After the first 5 minutes pass, add 1 cup (250 ml) of salt or white vinegar to the dye bath for every 3 gallons (12 L) of water. You should also add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid washing detergent.


Salt and vinegar help intensify the dye color. Use salt with cotton, linen, ramie, and rayon. Use vinegar with silk, wool, and nylon.
Liquid detergent allows the dye to move more freely throughout the water and into the fabric fibers.

, Once the additives are in the water, allow the curtains to soak in the dye bath for about two hours.This amount of time is standard if you want to produce the intended shade; however, you can leave the curtains in for a shorter or longer time if you want a lighter or darker shade, respectively.
Check the curtains periodically until you achieve the shade you want. Note, though, that the final shade will usually be a bit lighter than it appears when wet.
Agitate the curtains continuously. If you are machine dyeing the curtains, set the machine on an agitate cycle and continue agitating the fabric the entire time. If you are dyeing the curtains in a tub, stir the fabric every few minutes using a large painting stick or board., Take the curtains out of the dye bath and transfer them to your washing machine (if they are not already inside the machine). Run the machine through a full hot water cycle and set the rinse cycle to warm water.


If you can set the soil level of your washing machine, set it to ""heavy soil.""
Do not drain the dye bath if you dyed the curtains in your washing machine. Simply run the machine using the water already inside.

, Add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) liquid laundry detergent to the washing machine and run it on a normal to warm wash cycle with a cool rinse.


The first wash cycle should have washed away most of the excess dye. This second cycle should help set the dye.
Make sure that the water runs clear by the end of your cycle. When the water runs clear, the dye is set and should no longer bleed off the material.

, As long as the curtains are made from a material that can go through a dryer, the simplest and quickest way to dry them will be to toss them into your drying machine and tumble dry them on low until they are dry to the touch.


Alternatively, you can hang dry the curtains on a clothesline. They should air dry completely after a day or two, as long as the day is dry and the sun is bright.

, Most of the dye should be out of your washing machine by this point, but to avoid potential laundry mishaps, it is still a good idea to clean the washing machine by running it through another cycle. Add half a capful of liquid detergent and run the machine through a warm wash cycle with a cool water rinse.


Consider putting a little bleach in the washing machine for this step, as well.

, At this point, your curtains should be dyed and ready to hang in place.

Natural dyes work best with cotton, wool, silk, and muslin.
Chemical dyes work best with cotton, linen, silk, wool, and ramie. They also work well with rayon and nylon synthetic fabrics.
If you have a garment made from 60 percent dyeable fiber, like cotton, then you can usually dye it with a chemical dye even if the remaining fibers are not dyeable. Note, however, that the color will be much lighter than it would be with 100 percent dyeable fabrics.
Avoid clothes made of polyester, spandex, metallic fibers, or those labeled ""dry clean only."";
, The clothes you choose to dye should be clean before you begin. Put them through a normal warm washing cycle with a mild laundry detergent.


Make sure that all stains are removed before proceeding.
You can also use bleach to make your clothes even whiter. A pure white garment will produce a purer color than a dingy white garment.
You do not need to dry your clothes after washing them. They actually need to be wet for the dyeing process.

, Dyeing fabric can be messy business. To make the clean-up easier, cover your workspace with a plastic drop cloth or several layers of newspaper.


You should also keep sponges and paper towels nearby in case any dye spills as you work

, Dye fixatives allow your clothes to absorb the dye more readily. The best type of fixative will depend on the type of plant material used for the dye.


When making dye from berries, prepare a salt fixative. Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) salt with 8 cups (2 L) cold water.
When making dye from other plants, prepare a vinegar fixative. Combine 1 part white vinegar with 4 parts cold water.
When using a chemical dye, apply a fixative based on the type of fabric being dyed.
Let the clothes sit in this fixative solution for one hour. Rinse the clothes afterward in cool water before dyeing them.

, The material you choose will determine the color of your dye. Do a bit of research to determine which plants, berries, and spices can be used to produce the color you want.


Create orange dye with onion skin, carrot roots, butternut seed husks, and gold lichen.
Create brown dye using dandelion roots, oak bark, walnut husks and hulls, tea bags, coffee, acorns, and goldenrod shoots.
Make pink dye using strawberries, cherries, red raspberries, and grand fir bark.
Create blue-purple dye with dogwood bark, red cabbage, lavender elderberries, purple mulberries, cornflower petals, blueberries, purple grapes, and purple iris.
Make a red-brown dye using elderberries, red onion skin, pomegranates, beets, bamboo, and dried hibiscus flowers.
Form a gray to black dye using blackberries, walnut hulls, oak galls, and butternut hulls.
Make a red-purple dye with daylilies, huckleberries, or basil.
Go for a green dye by using artichokes, sorrel roots, spinach leaves, Black-eyed Susans, snapdragons, lilac flowers, grass, or yarrow flowers.
Make yellow dye using bay leaves, alfalfa seeds, marigold blossoms, St. John's Wort, dandelion flowers, daffodil flower heads, paprika, and turmeric.

, Any plant material you decide to use needs to be in a ripe, mature state.


Fruit and berries need to be ripe.
Nuts need to be mature.
Blossoms should be in full bloom and near the end of their life cycle.
Seeds, leaves, and stems can be harvested as soon as they grow in.

, The plant material should be chopped into fine pieces using a kitchen knife. Transfer the plant material to a large stockpot.


The stockpot should be about twice as large as the clothes you plan to dye.
Cutting the material into fine pieces exposes more surface area, so the natural color of the material is drawn out more easily.

, Fill the pot with water and bring it to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to low and let simmer for roughly 60 minutes.


Use twice as much water as plant material.

, Pour the dye through a colander to remove the plant material from the liquid. Transfer the liquid back into your dyeing stockpot.

, Place your wet clothes in the dye bath and simmer together over medium heat until the desired color is achieved.


Note that the color will be lighter once it dries.
At minimum, you will need to let the clothes sit in the dye bath for 30 to 60 minutes.
For a rich shade, let the clothes sit in the dye bath 8 hours or overnight.
Stir the clothes in the dye bath occasionally to ensure even dyeing.

, For the first washing, wash your dyed clothes in cold water apart from other garments.


The colors will run.
Dry your clothes using a dryer or by drying them in the sun.

, Fill a large stockpot three-quarters full with water. Bring it up to a simmer on your stove using medium heat.


Use a 2-gallon (8-L) stockpot. Otherwise, you may not have enough room to adequately and evenly dye your clothes.

, For chemical dyes, the fixative should be added directly to the dye bath. The fixative should be determined based on the type of fabric your clothes are made from.


For natural fibers, like cotton and silk, add 1 cup (250 ml) of salt to the water as it comes to a boil.
For synthetic fibers, like nylon, add 1 cup (250 ml) of white vinegar to the water.

, You can use granular dye or liquid dye. Follow the instructions provided on the package to determine the correct amount of dye to use.


If using a box of powder dye, you will usually pour the entire package into the simmering water.
If using liquid dye, you will usually use half the bottle.
Stir the dye into the water until evenly dispersed.

, Drop the clothing item into the dye bath until the entire garment is covered.


Use a mixing spoon to press the fabric completely beneath the surface.

, Once the dye bath reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes.


Stir the garment periodically to ensure even dyeing.
Do not cover the stockpot.

, Carefully remove the clothes from the hot dye bath using two spoons and lift it until a metal sink. Run hot water over your garment, gradually decreasing the temperature until it reaches ice cold water and the water running off the garment turns clear.


Dump your dye bath in a metal sink to dispose of it.
A lot of dye will come out as you rinse the fabric. This is normal and inevitable.
Using ice cold water at the end sets the dye into the clothing.

, Hang the clothes somewhere and let it dry completely.


Do not dry in a drying machine.
Place an old towel or rag beneath the clothing to catch any dripping dye as the item dries.

, Use the hottest water possible as long as it is safe for use with the type of fabric you are dyeing.


Set the washing machine to fill with enough water for a small load. If you fill the machine all the way, you will dilute the dye too much and end up with a faded garment.

, Pour the dye into the water as the basin continues to fill.


Do not add the clothes yet.
By adding the dye to the machine as it fills with water, you do not need to stir it in. The rapid flow of water into the basin will stir the dye in well enough.
Follow package instructions for the chemical dye you choose to use. You will usually use a full package of powder dye or half a bottle of liquid dye.

, Once your washing machine has finished filling, add your clothes.


Note that the clothes should be wet before you add them to the washing machine dye bath. Otherwise, the color will not set correctly.

, Reset the washing cycle so that it takes a full 30 minutes to complete. Set the machine to a longer cycle if you want to produce a stronger color.


The advantage of the washing machine is that you do not need to stir the clothes as they sit in the dye bath. Instead, the washing machine will agitate the clothes for you.

, Let the clothes go through a full rinse cycle in your washing machine to strain out some of the excess dye.


Use warm water for this rinse cycle. Warm water will draw out the excess dye more readily than cold water.

, Wash the clothes in a normal cycle with cold water and mild detergent.


The cold water will set the dye. Meanwhile, this wash cycle will wash the clothes, cleaning them after they have soaked in the dye bath.
Do not wash any other clothes with the dyed garments.
Dry the clothes in a dryer or by hanging them in the sunlight to dry.

, After you remove your dyed clothes from the washing machine, run your machine through another wash cycle to rinse out any excess dye and prepare it for your next load of laundry.


For best results, use hot water and 1 cup (250 ml) of bleach.

, If you have a large number of buttons to choose from, you may want to lay each out on your work surface. Arrange the buttons until you're happy with the color scheme and have a general idea of how many you want to use in your necklace.At this point, you should also take into consideration the sizes and shapes of your buttons.
Your necklace might benefit from larger buttons being used in the center with smaller buttons tapering to either side.
You might also stack smaller buttons atop larger ones to give your necklace contour. However, this approach will require extra line to thread the buttons.

, Use your tape measure to portion out a length of your line that matches the length you envision for your necklace. Then add four inches (10 cm) to the end to allow enough line for weaving on buttons and tying off the end of your line.


If you intend on stacking your buttons, you should add an extra six inches (15¼ cm) to be sure you can accommodate the vertical threading distance.
Depending on the size of your neck, your necklace might require a larger or smaller length, but generally:14"" long: choker length16"" long: collar sized. May reach the collarbone on petite individuals or feel like a choker for plus sizes18"" long: descends below the throat at the collarbone; a popular pendant length20"" long: lays below the collarbone; suitable for deep necklines22"" long: rests approximately at low necklines

, Tie a simple, sturdy knot to the end of your clasp. Pull the knot tight to ensure that it is securely fastened. You'll need to leave your other end loose for now so that you can string your buttons on the line.

, You might alternate your line, threading it first in front of your button and then behind, to create an even arrangement of buttons.As mentioned previously, you can also stack smaller buttons atop larger ones, threading your line through the stack to give your necklace a 3-D look.


The more buttons you stack atop each other, the more thread will be needed to accommodate the vertical threading through the stack.

, Remember, as you slide buttons onto the loose end of your line, the first button will form the outer edge closest to your clasp. This means that you'll likely have to string several buttons before you reach the center of the necklace, where you'll probably want to add a special button as a centerpiece., Grasp the loose end of your necklace securely so buttons don't fall off and hold your necklace up to your neck to check its length. You may need to add or remove some buttons before it's satisfactory. Then, tie your line to a jump ring, or a small metal ring for the clasp to latch onto, and pull the knot tight.

, Wrap your necklace around your neck and clip the clasp in place. Take note of any irregularities or issues you see with the pattern you used. This will be helpful in improving your skill in fashioning beautiful button jewelry.

Finished.",How to Make a Button Pin3," The color and style of the buttons is entirely up to you but you might like to consider some of the following ideas:


Choose matching but varying hues.
Choose the exact same color; this could be good where you want it stand out against a plain top.
Choose a rainbow of colors.
Choose different patterns, or even sizes of buttons.
Whatever buttons you choose, ensure that they are in excellent condition and will be able to withstand being turned into an often-worn item of jewelry. Older, more fragile buttons may not be ideal for this project.

, For alternating colors, choose an even number of buttons. Arrange the buttons in a circle, alternating the colors and check that the look is suitable. You can have an odd number of buttons if the colors are matching.

, For this, the button needs to be much larger than the petal buttons, as they will sit around it. You can either match this button to the petals or choose a button in a completely different color, texture or style, as long as you like how it looks.


Place the large central button over the already-made circle of petal buttons. Make sure you can see the petals poking out from around the edges.

, Place this one on top of the big button. Do the same for each additional layer you want (obviously, you're limited by how large your central button is).

,, Using hot glue, glue the petals to the center. Then flip it back over. Use hot glue again, but this time to add the center layers. Now you have a fixed button flower.

, Glue it to the back of the flower.

, On the side that doesn't open, lather this with hot glue. Place it on the middle of the craft foam circle. Then place a lot of glue on either side of the pin, and on top of the side that doesn't close. Press it in for a few seconds. Then let it dry. If needed, add more glue until the pin sticks.

, Enjoy your new button pin.

Glue your bail to your base and your buttons together.,
String your bail on your chain to complete the necklace.",How to Make a Button Necklace2," Most of these can be found at your local craft store, or in the craft section of a general retailer. Where glue is concerned, a transparent adhesive that works for most plastics and metal should work just fine for your buttons and bail, but if your buttons are made of something different, choose your glue accordingly. All together, you'll need:


Bail (for attaching button)
Ball chain
Buttons
Glue, For this project, you will be attaching a small stack of your favorite buttons to create a stylish retro pendant. To do this, you'll need a larger than average base button, an average sized middle button, and a small button to go on top.Experiment with different arrangements of color see which suits your tastes best.
Unique or specialty designed buttons should be available at your local craft store and can create an even more spectacular centerpiece., You might want to lay some newspaper beneath your crafting area to prevent glue from getting on your work space. Then use your glue to attach your largest button to your bail. Follow the directions on your glue to determine how long you should let your glue to set and dry. Then:


Glue your middle button to the large button base. Allow this to set and dry according to label direction.
Glue your final button atop the middle button and allow to dry., Take your ball chain necklace and unhook it at the clasp. Now you can string your bail and its attached button pendant design onto the chain.Clasp your new necklace onto your neck and see how it looks!

Finished.

",How to Make a Button Necklace3," This button necklace will be strung on a wire, making it more durable than those that use thread. To shape the wire into loops, you'll need crimp beads and jewelry pliers, which you might not have but can be purchased from your local craft store. Including these items, you'll also need:


Buttons
Chain
Clasp
Crimp beads (2)
Jewelry pliers
Jump rings (2)
Tiger-tail wire
Wooden beads (4)

, Your wire is where you'll be stringing your buttons and beads to create the pattern of your necklace. You will attach this length of wire to your chain to complete the neck chain, so you'll only need about six to eight inches (15 - 20 cm), plus four inches (10 cm) for connecting wire to chain with loops.

, Thread one end of your wire through your crimp bead and follow it with a jump ring. Now you can loop your wire around and bring it back through the way it came, keeping the loop on the outside of the crimp bead. Then use your jewelry pliers to crimp the crimp bead and fix the loop and jump ring into place.


Your loop should be about ¼ to ½ inch (½ - 1¼ cm) in size.

, These wooden beads will give a nostalgic aesthetic to your necklace while helping keep your buttons together. The beads you string first onto your wire will form the outside of your pattern closest to your crimp bead.


Be careful that your wooden beads are not so large that they bypass the jump ring.

, To create a uniform appearance, you may want to stick with buttons that are roughly the same size.Adding a variety of colors can give your necklace a lively appearance. String your buttons flat-wise one after another until you have about two inches (5 cm) of free wire remaining.To complete the symmetry of your necklace, you should end with two wooden beads, same as the beginning of your pattern.

, Just as you did with your starting loop, first string a crimp bead and then follow it with a jump ring. Then bring around the end of your wire to feed back through the crimp bead and use your jewelry pliers to crimp fasten the loop.


Your second loop should mirror your first, and should be about ¼ to ½ inch (½ - 1¼ cm) in size.

, Use the clasp of your chain to connect the jump ring at one end and then open the other jump ring with your jewelry pliers. Attach the loose end of your chain to the jump ring and bend it back closed with the pliers to complete the chain. Slip the finished necklace over your head or unclasp it and re-clasp it around your neck.


If you find that your necklace is a little on the long side, you can remove a few links of the chain with your jewelry pliers.

Get ready to tub-dye your fabric.,
Repeat another application of wax to add more layers of color and design.,
Remove the wax.,
Wash and dry your fabric.",How to Batik1," Use hot water to wash the fabrics in a detergent (such as Synthrapol) to remove chemicals and impurities that can affect dyes.;
, These base colors are the colors that will show under the wax resist.

, Batik wax comes in a brick that needs to be melted in either an electric wax pot or double boiler.


Use caution with hot wax. Do not heat it above 240° as it could begin to emit fumes or even catch fire.
It is not recommended that you heat wax on the stove top. Wax pots and double boilers heat the wax slowly and at a lower heat.

, The hoop will keep the fabric taught and stable, allowing you to apply wax with greater precision.


If you are applying designs to large swaths of fabric, you can lay newsprint or cardboard on your work surface without stretching it on a hoop. The wax will penetrate through the fabric, so a protective surface underneath is highly recommended.

, Various tools will yield different line qualities, so some experimentation beforehand is recommended.


Use a single-spouted tjanting tool to draw thin lines and designs. It is a standard tool that is very versatile and comes in a variety of spout sizes.
A double-spouted tjanting tool creates parallel lines and can also be used in filling larger areas.
Brushes can also be used to cover large areas. They can be used traditionally, in broad strokes, or as a stippling tool for a dot pattern.
Use stamps for the application of uniform shapes. Stamps can be made of anything that can take the heat of the wax. Try carving a potato into a shape, or using the end of a celery stalk to stamp out half circles.

, The wax should be hot enough to penetrate through the fabric, but not be so hot and thin that it spreads when applied. The wax will be clear if it has penetrated to the other side of the fabric.

, When considering which dye colors to use, it is recommended that you begin with the lightest colors first (like yellow) and then move towards darker colors.


Wash your fabric in Synthrapol.
Dissolve your dye by following instructions on the package. Some dyes (like reds) are harder to dissolve than other.
Add in the appropriate amount of non-iodized salt. For a 1/2 pound of dry fabric, add in 1 1/2 cups of salt. For a pound of fabric, use 3 cups of salt.
Add in your damp fabric. Stir gently, but frequently for 20 minutes.
Mix up your soda ash. Soda ash, or sodium carbonate, is used to bond the dye to the cellulose in fiber. Dissolve the ash in warm water and add it into the tub slowly (over the course of 15 minutes), being careful not to dump it directly onto the fabric (which could cause discoloration). For each 1/2 pound of dry fabric, add in 1/6 cups of salt. For a pound of fabric, use 1/3 cups of salt. Stir gently, but frequently for another 30 minutes.
Rinse you fabric and wash out excess dye. Run cool water over your fabric until it runs clear. Then wash it in hot water using Synthrapol. With some darker colors, like red or brown, a second washing may be necessary to remove all excess dye. Allow the fabric to dry.

, With every additional layer you wish to add, follow the steps for tub dyeing. Remember to tub dye your darkest colors last.

, When you are done with all the color dyeing, you may remove the wax in one of two ways:


Boil the wax out. Fill a pot large enough to hold your fabric with water and a few drops of Synthrapol. Once the water begins to boil, add in your fabric and weigh it down with a rock to keep the wax (which will be floating at the top) from re-bonding with the fabric. After a few minutes, the wax will pull out of the fabric. After all the wax appears to be out of the fabric, allow the pot to cool completely, and peel the wax layer from the top of the pot.
Iron the wax out. Place the fabric between two sheets of absorbent paper and run the iron over the sandwiched fabric. The wax can leave behind a residue, so use care to ensure the wax is removed. Periodically changing out the papers can aid in wax removal.

, Throw your fabric into the washing machine with Synthrapol one last time to ensure all of the dyes have been released. Dry your fabric either on a line, or in the dryer. All batiked!"

Apply the dye.,
Cover the fabric with plastic wrap.,
Nuke your fabric.,
Remove the fabric from the microwave.,
Wash and dry your fabric.",How to Batik2," Lay your pre-washed and pre-dyed fabric over the overlapped sheets of plastic wrap.

, As with traditional batiking, you may use the single or double-spouted tjanting tool to create thin lines for designs. Use paint brushes to cover larger areas with the medium. Allow the medium to dry for approximately 30 minutes, though exact dry time depends on how thickly the medium was applied.


Consider using stamps dipped in the medium to create a repeat pattern. You can use a stencil by placing it down on the fabric and dabbing the medium around it with a foam brush.

, Follow the instructions on the package to mix up the dye. If you are using a liquid dye, adjusting the water-to-dye ratio can create softer (add more water) or more vivid colors (add more dye).

, Dyes can be dribbled, painted, sprayed, or dabbed on. Consider mixing two or more colors together to create color variations.

, Once you have finished with your dye application, cover the fabric with plastic wrap and seal the edges., Place paper towels on the bottom of the microwave oven to protect against spills. Place your plastic-covered fabric in the microwave oven (you may need to fold the fabric) and cook on high for 2 minutes.

, Using thick rubber gloves, carefully remove the fabric from the microwave oven. The fabric will be hot, so use caution! Allow the fabric to cool for a few minutes before removing the plastic.

, Rinse your fabric under cool water until it runs clear. After you've removed the initial dye, wash the fabric in warm water with a mild detergent, and rinse. Dry your fabric."

Prewash your silk.,
Stretch your silk.,
Elevate your frame.,
Apply your resist.,
Apply your color.,
Allow your painted silk to set for 24 hours.",How to Batik3," Add a drop or two of liquid dish soap to a tub or bucket of water. Rinse and dry your fabric. While still slightly damp, press your fabric with an iron set to the ""silk"" setting.


If you wish to sketch out a design instead of painting it freehand, this would be done after ironing.

, Apply safety pins connected to rubber bands around the edges of your silk--every 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm). Lay your silk over the frame and begin to apply push pins to the frame. The rubber bands will hook around push pins set into the frame to create a taut trampoline.


The rubber bands should be small enough to maintain good tension, but long enough to as to avoid tearing the fabric.
You can link two rubber bands together to create longer ones if your frame is much larger than the piece of silk.
The goal is to create a taut surface on which to paint. The surface should be taut, but should not be too tight that it begins to tear.

, Place 4 plastic cups or containers under the frame to raise it off the work surface.

, The resist can be applied with a paint brush, or through the narrow spout of an applicator bottle. Allow the resist to dry completely before moving on to color. Depending on preference, there are two type of resists that work well for silk painting:


Rubber based resists, or guttae, are similar in consistency to rubber cement and can be diluted to a thin consistency useful for drawing finer lines. After the color has been set, they are removed by dry-cleaning the finished fabric. The downside of this resist is the fumes it produces. It is recommended that you use a respirator in a well-ventilated area when applying rubber based gutta.
Water soluble resists are non-toxic, odorless, and wash away in warm water. These resists work well in conjunction with silk paints (as opposed to dyes), which are heat set with heat. The downside to this resist is that it's not as free-flowing as other guttae, and fine details are harder to achieve.

, Carefully apply your dye or paint with a brush. Allow the color to flow towards an area of resist. Painting directly on the resist may cause it to dissolve and fill in. There are two options when it comes to color:


Silk paints are pigment-based products that color the surface of the fabric, but do not penetrate into the fabric's fiber. These colors can be used on a wide variety of fabrics (including synthetics) and are set with a dry iron
Silk dyes color fabric by forming a bond with the fibers in the fabric. These are a wonderful choice if you do not want to diminish the natural luster of silk. Colors are light-fast and washable.

, If you have opted for silk paints, heat-set the color by applying the iron for 2-3 minutes on the back side of the fabric. After ironing, rinse the silk in warm water, hang to dry, and iron again while still slightly damp.


If you used silk dyes, after allowing the color to dry for 24 hours, rinse the fabric until the water runs clear. Add a couple of drops of light detergent or dish soap to a bucket or tub and wash the silk. Rinse again with cool water, and hang to dry. When the silk is almost dry, apply a dry iron heated to the ""silk"" setting.

Protect your workspace.,
Collect your buttons.You can dye buttons that are either plastic or nylon.,
Gather your dyeing materials.You will need containers to hold your dye baths, a measuring cup and measuring spoons, a stirring spoon, and dye.",How to Dye Buttons1," Because you will be working with permanent dyes, you want to use something to ensure you don’t stain the floor or table. You also want to take precaution not to stain your skin or clothing.


You can use a drop cloth, layers of newspaper, plastic garbage bags, or a plastic table cloth. Whichever you choose, consider taping it down to your work area so that it stays in place while you complete your project, and make sure it isn’t thin enough that the dye could seep through it.
If you are working on a table, consider also laying a drop cloth on the floor underneath you, in case the dye splashes.
Wear old clothes that you don’t mind getting dye on. You can also just put a large, old t-shirt or button down over the clothes you are wearing to keep them clean.
When you dye your buttons, wear rubber gloves to protect your skin.;
, Use buttons that are either white or a very light color for the best color payoff.


Consider trying out different shapes, sizes, and styles of buttons to see which ones come out best after you dye them. This will give you options for your project.
Buttons with designs carved on them make great candidates for dying, as the color varies and gives them even more dimension.

,


You should have a bowl or plastic container for each color you plan on using. Each one should be able to hold one cup of liquid. Make sure your containers can withstand hot water.
You can find dye at local hobby and craft stores in sections with other fabric craft supplies. Rit is a good all-purpose brand of dye to use for dyeing your buttons.If you choose another brand, read the label to ensure you will be able to dye your plastic buttons.
It’s best to use a disposable or stainless steel spoon to stir.
If you choose to dye your buttons with ink, you’ll need alcohol-based ink, q-tips, and a sealer like mod podge.

Weave the tail in.",How to Crochet a Button2," Create an adjustable ring, more commonly known as a ""magic ring,"" with your yarn. Make one chain stitch to secure the loop.

, Make two more chain stitches from the loop on your crochet hook. Work eleven double crochets into the loop of the magic ring. Gently tug on the ends of the magic ring to close it into a tight circle.


Note that the initial set of two chain stitches will be counted as a single double crochet.
Your circle should have 12 double crochet stitches in it, including your set of two chain stitches.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail, and pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie it off.


The tail should be at least 8 inches (20.32 cm) long.

, Insert the tail end of the yarn into the eye of a darning needle, loosely tying the end of the yarn onto the needle to hold it on.


Alternatively, you could just hold the end of the yarn in place with your fingertip instead of tying it on.

, Insert the darning needle through the top of your first double crochet and back out through the back loop of the last stitch.


Note that you need to weave it into your first actual double crochet, not through the starting set of two chains.
This should create the appearance of an extra stitch and create a clean appearance with a round edge from the front.

, Use your darning needle to weave the tail end into the stitches along the back of the button, securing it while simultaneously hiding it.

Embellish with a flower.A flower embellishment is a little more complex and requires one contrasting color yarn for the center and a second to use when making five petals.",How to Crochet a Button3," Each of these embellished crochet buttons start with one of the basic crochet buttons described above. Since the stitches are easier to see on the magic ring version, that is usually preferred, but you can experiment with either option.

, Use a crochet hook and darning needle to weave a contrasting color of yarn through the edges of your double stitches in a magic ring basic button.


Insert your crochet hook through the top of one of your double stitches. Grab the contrasting yard from the other side and pull a loop through to the front.
With the loop still on your hook, insert the hook in between the next double crochet stitch of your button, pulling a new, second loop onto your hook.
Pull this second loop through the original loop on your hook.
Continue in this manner, working counter-clockwise around the button and pulling up new loops in between all the double crochet stitches.
When pulling the yarn through the last stitch, cut the yarn and thread the end through a darning needle. Insert the needle under both loops of your first contrasting color stitch and back through the back loop of your last stitch. Draw the yarn to the back of the button.
Sew the end into the back of the button with your darning needle.

, You can make a simple six-pointed star or snowflake by diagonally weaving roughly 12 inches (30.5 cm) of contrasting yarn through the double stitches of a magic ring simple button with a darning needle.


Cut a piece of contrasting yarn measuring 12 inches (30.5 cm).
Thread the end of this yarn through the eye of a darning needle.
Insert the needle under two loops of one double crochet stitch in your button. Working over the top of the button, insert the needle into the button's center, pulling it back out through the back.
From the back, insert the needle once more under two loops of the next double crochet stitch in your button. From the front, insert the needle into the button's center again.
Continue in this manner, creating six lines extending from the center to the edge of the button.
Weave the ends of the yarn through the stitches on the back of the button to secure everything in place.

,


For the center of the flower:

Thread the yarn onto your darning needle.
Pull the darning needle up through the center of the button. Weave it under one inner loop in the center of the button and back up through the other side. Loop it around the tip of the needle.
Pull the length of the yarn through the two loops you just created.
Repeat, working a similar stitch into each loop at the center of the button. Tie it off on the back of the button.


For the petals:

Thread your yarn onto the darning needle.
Pull the yarn up through the center of the button, from underneath the center of your flower. Do not pull it through the flower center.
Insert the needle back into the center. Do not pull the loop it creates; instead, leave enough of the loop hanging to extend past the perimeter of the button.
From the back of the button, insert the needle through the stitch at the edge of the button, pulling it up to the front and through the loop you created when working from the center.
Pull to tighten the loop. One petal should be created.
Weave the needle over the outer edge of the petal and back to the back of the button.
From the back, repeat the same steps, creating four more petals. Tie off at the back when finished.

, Work ten single crochets into the center of the magic ring. Join the final single crochet with the top of the first single crochet with a slip stitch.


If necessary, tug on the ends of the magic ring to close it into a tight circle.
This completes the first round.

, Make one chain stitch to move onto the next round. Make two single crochets into each stitch of the previous round, joining the last and first at the top with another slip stitch.


This creates an increase, thereby enlarging your circle.
You should have a total of 20 crochet stitches in this second round.
After you finish this round, compare it to the size of the button. If you are on the right track, you should need to make another front round still to cover the front of the button.

, Make one chain stitch to move onto the next round. Single crochet once in the first stitch of the previous round, then single crochet twice in the next stitch. Continue all the way around the button, joining the first and last single crochets of this round with another slip stitch.


You should have 30 stitches in this round.
By now, your button cover should be about the same size as your button. If it is slightly larger, that will work too, since the excess can wrap around the back of the button.

, Chain stitch once to move onto the next round. Single crochet once in the first five stitches of the previous round, then make a single crochet decrease over the next two stitches from the previous round. Repeat all the way around, joining the last and first single crochets with a slip stitch.

Pour one cup of hot water into each of your bowls.,
Add the dye to your water.,
Place your buttons in the dye.,
Keep water warm for a rich, deep shade.,
Remove the buttons from the dye and rinse them.,
Wash dyeing supplies.",How to Dye Buttons2," The water needs to be hot enough to dissolve the dye and set the color on your buttons. It should be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit.


If your hot tap water is too cool, stick the water in your bowls in the microwave for about 30 seconds.

, Add only one color in each bowl. If you’re using liquid dye, add one teaspoon per cup of water. If you’re using powdered dye, add two teaspoons.


To create darker hues, add more dye to your bath.
Dip a small piece of white fabric or a white paper towel into your dye bath to test the color. Add more dye if it is too light for your taste or more hot water if it becomes too dark.
Use your spoon to stir the dye. It should be completely dissolved in the water, and the color should be even.

, The buttons should be completely submerged and have room to move within the container. You don’t want the buttons to touch, as this can create uneven color.


Leave the buttons in the dye for two to five minutes. The longer you leave them, the darker the color will be.
Check for color by using a spoon to gently lift one of the buttons out of the water. If the button is not yet the color you’d like to achieve, you can place it back into the dye bath for additional time.
If desire a very light shade, check your buttons early, at exactly two minutes.

, If you desire a dark color, you need to make sure your water stays around 140 degrees Farenheit.


To do this, use ceramic, heat-safe bowls to dye your buttons or the top of a double-boiler pot.
Fill another pot with about a half inch of water, and place it on your stovetop. Heat the water on low heat.
Then, place your dye bath bowl or pot overtop of this water to create indirect heat. Keep the heat on during the dyeing process.You can check the temperature of your dye bath with a candy thermometer, if you have one.

, Once they reach your desired color, you want to remove the buttons from the dye bath and rinse them so that no residual color stains anything, and they stay the color you like.


First, rinse the buttons with cool water.
Then, gently wash them with soap and water, and place them on a paper towel to dry completely.

, As soon as you are finished dyeing your buttons, you want to wash your bowls and spoons thoroughly with soap and water. The longer they sit with dye in them, the harder it will be to get the dye off.


If you’re using disposable bowls, simply throw them away.

Choose your ink colors.,
Place a few drops of ink onto your button.,
Continue adding layers of color until you get your desired shade.,
Get creative with your coloring.,
Cover your button with a sealer.",How to Dye Buttons3," Choose colors you like, and make sure that they are alcohol-based inks. Keep in mind that with this method you can always add more or less color depending on your desired vibrancy.


This method works well if you want to create buttons that are multi-colored or two-toned.

, Start with a very small amount of ink. It is easier to build up color than it is to take it away.


After you drop the ink onto your button, use a q-tip to spread it around evenly across the surface of the button.
Let this layer of ink dry completely before you continue with the process.

, If you want a very light shade, you may only need a single layer of color.


Continue to use a dropper, and then a q-tip to spread the color evenly. You can also use a small paint brush instead of a q-tip.
Wait until each layer of color dries to judge its shade, as wet ink tends to be darker than dried ink.

, With ink, you can make your buttons multi-colored. If you want, you can make each of the button’s sides a different color, or split the colors down the middle of the button.


For clean lines on your button, you can use painter’s tape to tape off one side while the other dries. For two-toned buttons, start with the lighter color first.
For extra embellishment after you dye your buttons, draw on designs with nail polish or colored sharpie.Use a toothpick to create designs with nail polish.

, This will keep the color in place, and add a protective finish to each of your buttons. Mod Podge works well.You can buy Mod Podge at most craft stores. Choose whether you want to have a glossy or matte finish.
In a pinch, you can use glue that dries clear as a sealer instead.
Simply take a clean, small paintbrush or q-tip, and dip it into your sealer. Spread a thin, even layer on one side of your button. Make sure to get the sides of the button covered.
Once the first side dries, turn the button over, and apply the sealer again.
If you get your sealer into the holes of the buttons, just use something sharp like a toothpick or needle to poke back through the holes.

",How to Dye Silk in a Microwave," See ""Things You'll Need"" below.;
, Measure 2 parts water to 1 part vinegar. Take the silk thing and soak it in that solution for 15 minutes. Make sure that it’s completely soaked through.

, These dyes come very concentrated so you can dilute them and mix them together to make nifty colors by using the diluted solution of the alcohol and the distilled water. Mix two thirds of a cup isopropyl alcohol (70%) with 1/3rd cup of distilled water to make the solution. This will keep your dyes from streaking too much.

, Once you have your colors ready and your silk piece is soaked you can start! Take the silk out of the vinegar solution and squeeze out the excess. Don’t wring it to much or you’ll damage it and it should be still very wet when you microwave it or it will burn. Place it in the microwave dish.

, There are many ways to do this and you can use a brush to paint it on or just pour it on wherever you want it. Sometimes you can get vague patterns that you can brush on. You won’t get much detail. Make sure your colors are contrasted enough for this or they will just meld into each other and you won’t see the pattern. You can also use elastic bands or string to do a tie dye type design.

, Two minutes is plenty if you are only doing one scarf and have a powerful microwave. You’ll know if it’s not done enough if when you rinse it out, all the dye comes out. There shouldn’t be too much dye run off.

, Add a bit of vinegar to the second last rinse just to balance out the PH at the end. Iron or hang to dry.

, This step will show you how to add some basic shapes to make your scarf more interesting. Place the scarf back into the vinegar solution and squeeze out excess as before and then lay out your scarf (you can fold it in half to make it easier) on a sheet of wax paper on a counter or other clean washable surface. Dye will get on your counter top but this easily washes off with the help of a household cleaner containing bleach. Then, using a very dark color or at least one that contrasts well with the other colors, paint on some basic shapes.

, Wash, rinse and dry as before. Voila! A beautiful scarf to wear in many ways!

A jacket that is 100% nylon should be relatively easy to dye, but if it is made from a synthetic blend that includes other materials (such as polyester or acetate, for example), then it may be more difficult to get the dye to stay.]Even if the jacket is made of a nylon blend, it will usually accept the dye if at least 60 percent of the jacket is made of nylon. Nylon blends are still dyeable as long as the other materials will also accept dye; examples include cotton, linen, silk, wool, ramie, and rayon.Some nylon is treated or coated for durability or stain/water resistance; this can prevent the material from accepting dye, so check the jacket label for this information, as well.;
, Even if your jacket is made of easily dyeable materials, its original color will significantly impact your coloring options. You should be able to dye a white or light grey jacket without much trouble, but if the jacket is another color then you might have some difficulty, especially if that color is already dark or intense.A white or off-white jacket will be easiest to dye, but you might also be able to dye over a light pastel color like a baby blue, soft pink, or buttercup yellow. Be aware, however, that the current color will alter the final appearance of the dye.
If you do attempt to dye a jacket that is already colored, make sure your dye is bright or dark in order to cover up the old color.

, Most standard chemical dyes can dye nylon, but you should make sure the one you choose will do this before you buy it.Most dyes will include information on the packaging about compatible materials; if you don't find this, check the manufacturer website.


Standard Rit dye works on both natural and synthetic fibers, but some brands have separate formulas for each type of material.Always read the manufacturer’s instructions to verify that the procedure is doable for your particular jacket. If the manufacturer's instructions differ from those described here, follow the manufacturer.
Many (though not all) fabric dyes come in powder form and must be mixed with water for dyeing.

, Dyeing is a very messy process and may stain certain surfaces. Protect the entire work area you plan to use by covering it with newspaper, plastic sheets, or some other drape or material that will not soak through if it becomes wet.


Keep clean paper towels, a household surface cleaner, and a source of clean water nearby. If any dye splashes where it shouldn't, you can use these to clean it off before it sets in.
Make sure to also protect your own clothing and skin by wearing rubber gloves, an apron or coveralls, and safety goggles. Even with all this protective gear, it is best to wear clothes you won't mind getting stained.

, Anything that can be easily removed from your jacket and that you do not want to dye should be taken off prior to dyeing. For example, if your jacket has a zip-out liner that you don't need to color, take it out. The same goes for detachable hoods, zipper pulls, etc.This will help ensure that you don't use up any of the dye on parts of your jacket that won't be seen or which you want to remain their original color.
If any removable parts of your jacket are black, take these off whether or not you wish to dye them -- dye will not show up on black nylon, anyway.
Check your jacket pockets for any items that may have mistakenly be left inside. You don't want to end up with the melted remains of a cough drop or lip balm coating the inside of your pocket!

, Immediately before you plan to dye it, completely submerge your jacket in warm water. This is recommended because wet fibers will absorb dye more evenly and thoroughly, resulting in a more professional-looking color job.Use a large bucket or deep sink for this task.
Smooth out any wrinkles in the jacket material once you remove it from the water. This will help ensure that the dye evenly coats all surfaces of the jacket once you begin the dyeing process.

, Fill a large, stainless steel pot with enough water to completely submerge the jacket. Place it on a stovetop over medium heat and bring it to a simmer or very low boil.

There must be plenty of room in the pot for the jacket to move around underneath the water. Otherwise, the nylon may absorb the dye unevenly.
You will need roughly 3 gallons of water for each package of dye you intend to use (but see the dye package for instructions). Using less water will create a stronger color; using more water will dilute the color.
Ideally, you should use a pot large enough to be roughly three-quarters full once you have added the desired amount of water.

, Fill a separate container with about 2 cups of hot water (or whatever amount is recommended by the dye manufacturer). Stir one packet of powdered dye into the water until the powder is completely dissolved. For liquid dye, you should still mix it, stirring until it is well-blended with the water.

You should not put powdered or liquid dye directly onto the jacket material unless you are going for an ""artistic"" look with uneven coloring.

, Pour the pre-dissolved dye into the pot of simmering water. Take a few moments to stir the concentrated dye into the water, allowing it to disperse evenly. This creates the ""dye bath,"" and it is an important step for creating the most even coloring possible.

If you do not have a pot big enough to hold the appropriate amount of water plus your jacket, you can pour the simmering water into a plastic bucket or tub before mixing in your dissolved dye. Do not use fiberglass or porcelain sinks or tubs for this, as they may stain.For best results, the dye bath should be kept warm (about 140 degrees Fahrenheit) during the dyeing process, so consider this fact when deciding whether to use a stovetop pot versus a separate container., Add 1 cup of distilled white vinegar per 3 gallons of dye bath. This helps the dye cling to the nylon fibers in the jacket and will produce a more intense result.If you don't have any vinegar, you can still dye your jacket. However, you may end up with a tint that isn't as deep as you could have otherwise achieved.

, Slowly and carefully lower the jacket into the simmering dye bath, pressing it down into the water until the entire thing is submerged and covered by dye. Let the jacket ""cook"" in the dye bath for up to one hour, stirring or agitating the jacket constantly.

Don't just put the jacket in the pot and trust that it will sink itself; any air trapped under the jacket will make it float and result in uneven coloring.
Use a large spoon or disposable chopsticks to press the jacket down into the dye bath. This will prevent you from getting burned by the hot water and will keep your hands from getting stained.
Once the material is soaked thoroughly, the jacket should stay submerged beneath the dye bath surface. Keep stirring it around in the dye bath to ensure that all surfaces are evenly coated.
Your jacket color will turn out brighter (or darker, depending on the color of dye) if you leave it in the dye bath longer.
Note that the color will always look darker after soaking than it will when the process is completely finished.

, Turn off the stove, then use two spoons or gloved hands to carefully lift the jacket out of the dye bath and into a stainless steel sink. Be sure to hold an old towel or plastic sheet underneath the jacket as you move it out of the pot to keep the dye bath water from dripping on the floor or countertop.


It might be a good idea to take the pot to your laundry room sink and drop the jacket into that one instead of the one in your kitchen, especially if your kitchen sink is porcelain or fiberglass.
If you don't have a sink or wash basin that can be used for this, take the entire pot (with the jacket still in it) outside and hold it over the ground before removing the jacket.

, Rinse the jacket under hot, running water, dropping its temperature gradually. This serves to get rid of excess dye. If you do not have a sink in your home you can do this in, a garden hose outside will suffice; however, you won't be able to use hot water. Rinse the jacket until the water running off of it is clear.

Once the water runs clear, briefly rinse the jacket with very cold water; this helps to set the dye into the nylon fibers.
Even though the excess dye should now be removed from your jacket, you should hold an old towel under the jacket while transporting it to ensure no tinted water drips on your floor.

, Carefully dump the dye bath down the drain of your laundry sink. It is best to avoid pouring all that dye down your kitchen or bathroom sink, especially if they are made of stainable materials (such as porcelain). Dispose of any towels or plastic sheets that got dye on them during the process (or set them aside for separate cleaning).

If you don't have a laundry room sink, you can pour the dye bath into the floor drain of a cellar or basement.
If you must pour the dye bath down a bathroom toilet or tub drain, you will need to then immediately clean the area with a bleach-based cleaner. If the dye dries, it'll likely create a permanent stain.
If you dump your dye bath outside, make sure you flush the ground with plenty of clean water to dissipate the dye; don't do this on cement or gravel, as the dye will stain it, too!

, Place the newly dyed jacket in your washing machine and wash it by itself with a normal amount detergent and cold water. This helps to further remove any excess dye and prepare your jacket to be worn without staining the clothing it touches.

Be advised that unless your washing machine has a stainless steel drum, this process could permanently stain the inside of your machine. If you are concerned about this, hand-wash your jacket instead.
After this first washing, you should be able to wear it. However, your jacket should still be washed on its own in cold water for the next two or three washes because some residual dye could still bleed off in the water.
Always check your jacket tag before washing it and follow the manufacturer's care instructions. If your jacket is ""hand-wash only,"" do not put it in the washing machine.

, Toss the jacket into a dryer and tumble dry on low heat. Once the jacket is completely dry, it should be ready to wear. In order to further prevent potential dye bleed-off, dry the jacket by itself.

Hang dry your jacket instead of machine drying it if the care tag says to do so.
If you hang the jacket to dry, place an old towel beneath it to catch any dye that might drip off.

, If you removed anything from your jacket before dyeing it (such as a hood, zipper pulls, or a jacket liner), you may now put those items back onto your jacket. At this point, there should be minimal risk of staining these accessory items by letting them touch and rub against the dyed jacket.


If you are concerned that contact between your dyed jacket and an un-dyed accessory item could cause some coloring to rub off where it shouldn't, wait until you've washed the jacket a few times before replacing these items.

, If you don't like the match-up between your jacket's new color and the color of its buttons and zippers (which will not dye), you can swap out many of these objects to match the new color scheme. For example:


Unstitch or carefully cut out the old zipper, then sew in a new zipper that measures the same length as the old one.
Cut the thread holding any old buttons in place. Grab new buttons that match your newly dyed jacket and sew these buttons in the same places the old buttons were.

Plan to waterproof your fabric on a dry, windless day.,
Clean the fabric if it is dirty.,
Make sure that the fabric is dry.,
Transfer the fabric to a well-ventilated area.,
Purchase a waterproofing spray and seam sealer.,
Hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the fabric and apply the sealer in a light, even layer.,
Wait about for the spray to dry, then apply a second coat.,
Apply seam sealer to all of the seams.",How to Waterproof Fabric1," You will be working with spray-on sealers, which are sensitive to humidity. Also, if you are working outside and it is windy, you might get some dust embedded in your fabric.






;
, If the fabric cannot be washed, and it is only dusty or lightly soiled fabrics then clean it a vacuum or a brush. If the fabric is heavily soiled, then use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner.








, You will be working sprays and sealers that repel water. If your fabric is in anyway damp or wet, the sprays and sealers will not stick.








, Try to work outside, if you can. If you cannot work outside, then open up a window. You can also wear safety goggles and gloves if you have sensitive skin or bad allergies; the sprays and sealers you will be working with can be quite pungent.








, You can find them at an outdoor or camping supply store. If the fabric you will be waterproofing will be outside and in the sun a lot, then consider getting a spray that has UV protection as well. This will keep your fabric from fading.









Waterproofing sprays and sealers will work great on nylons, canvas and leather.

, Be sure to slightly overlap each stroke.








, Let the spray dry completely before using the fabric. Most waterproofing sprays will dry in about 4 hours, but you might want to read the directions on the can as each brand will be a little different., Seam sealer usually comes in a small bottle with an applicator on top. Simply roll the sealer over the seams while squeezing gently on the bottle. This will make the seams extra durable and ensure that no water gets inside.

Start with a clean piece of fabric.,
Mix 1 pound (0.45 kg) of laundry detergent with 2 gallons (7.5 L) of hot water in a large container.,
Soak the fabric in the mixture until it is completely saturated.,
Hang the fabric to air-dry in the sun.,
Combine ½ pound (0.25 kg) of alum with 2 gallons (7.5 L) of hot water in a second container.,
Soak the fabric in alum powder solution for at least 2 hours.Make sure that the fabric is completely submerged.,
Hang the fabric in the sun to air-dry completely.",How to Waterproof Fabric2," If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it. For dusty or lightly soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a vacuum or a brush. For heavily soiled fabrics that cannot be washed, use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner.








, You want the container to be large enough so that you can submerge all of your fabric in the detergent mixture.








, If parts of the fabric keep floating to the top, you can weigh them down with a glass jar or bottle., Do not fold it over a hanger, or the two sides will stick to each other. Instead, clip the top of the fabric piece to a hanger. If the fabric is too big for a hanger, then stretch a long piece of string between two poles or trees, and clip the fabric to that. You want the fabric to hang freely, in a single layer.








, Stir the solution to help the alum powder dissolve. You can buy alum powder at a grocery store., If it floats to the top, then weigh it down with a glass jar or bottle.








, Once again, make sure that the fabric is hanging freely. Clip it to a hanger, or to a piece of string.

Understand that this may cause the fabric to darken.,
Start with a clean piece of fabric.,
Allow the fabric to dry completely after you clean it.,
Transfer the fabric to a well-ventilated area.,
Mix 1 cup (237 ml) of soybean oil with 4 ounces (118 ml) of turpentine.,
Spread the fabric out onto a flat surface.,
Paint the mixture on using a wide bristle paintbrush.,
Lay the fabric flat to dry completely.",How to Waterproof Fabric3," You will be saturating the fabric with turpentine-diluted oil. Oil in general tends to darken fabrics by a shade or two. This is something you might want to keep in mind., Wash the fabric if it is dirty. If the fabric cannot be washed, and it's only a little dirty or dusty, then clean it with a vacuum or a brush. If the fabric cannot be washed and it is heavily soiled, then clean it using a specially-formulated fabric cleaner.








, You will be working with waxes, oils, and other solutions that repel water. If your fabric is in anyway damp or wet, the solutions you will be using will not stick.








, Try to work outside, if you can. If you cannot work outside, then keep a window open. Turpentine can get quite pungent.








, Pour everything into a durable plastic container and stir it with a wooden paint stirrer. You will be painting the mixture onto your fabric later using a large paintbrush.









If you are working on a small piece of fabric, then you can pour everything into a plastic spray bottle and spray it on. Close the bottle and shake it to mix everything together.

, Turpentine and oil can both stain porous surfaces such as wood and concrete. If you are worried about this, you might want to protect your work surface with plastic tablecloth first. Don't use newspaper. The ink can transfer to your fabric., Dip a large paintbrush into the mixture, and wipe the excess mixture off on the rim of the bucket. Brush the mixture onto the fabric using a long, straight, even stroke. Keep brushing the mixture onto the fabric until everything is covered. Always go in the same direction. Also, try to overlap the strokes by a little; this will prevent any gaps.









A wide, flat bristle brush will work the best for this. Avoid soft bristles, such as camel hair.
If you are using a spray bottle, then simply spray the mixture onto the fabric. Try to overlap the patches by a little to avoid any gaps.

, This can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days. Once again, turpentine and soybean oil can both cause stains, so it might be a good idea to cover the flat surface with a plastic tablecloth first.

Purchase some iron-on vinyl from a fabric store.,
Get out your fabric, but don't cut your fabric yet, if you are using a pattern.,
Make sure that the fabric is clean and dry.,
Lay the fabric on a flat surface.,
Cut the vinyl so that it fits your fabric.,
Peel off the paper backing.,
Set the vinyl, sticky-side-down onto the right side of the fabric.,
Cover the vinyl with the paper backing.,
Run an iron over the paper.,
Take the paper off.",How to Waterproof Fabric4," This vinyl doesn't change the appearance of the fabric, and is great for waterproofing baby bibs and lunch bags., Once you have waterproofed the fabric, you can use it as a tablecloth, or even cut it up and sew it into a lunch bag., If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it, and let it dry completely.









If the fabric cannot be washed, then use a vacuum or a brush. You can also use a specially-formulated fabric cleaner if the fabric is heavily soiled.

, This will make the fabric easier to work with. Any ripples or folds will end up as wrinkles in the finished piece. If necessary, iron the fabric out to get it as smooth as possible., If the vinyl is too narrow for your fabric, then you will need to cut the vinyl to the length of your fabric. You will need to cut several pieces like this, and overlap them later on., You will notice that the paper has two sides: a shiny side and a dull side. You will also notice that the vinyl has two sides as well: a sticky side and a smooth side., If the vinyl is not wide enough, lay two sheets of vinyl next to each other. Overlap the edges by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter)., Make sure that the shiny side of the paper is facing down, and that the paper is covering the vinyl entirely. You will be ironing the vinyl, and the paper will help protect it from getting melted., Turn on your iron and set it to medium heat. Do not use a high heat setting, or you will melt the vinyl. Carefully run the iron over the paper. Do not leave it in one spot for too long, and do not use any steam., The heat of the iron will have melted the glue on the vinyl, and fused it to the fabric."

Choose your balloons.,
Blow up balloons using a helium tank.,
Assemble the first ice cream cone.,
Place balloon on top of the cone.,
Punch a small hole toward the base of the cone and add the ribbon.",How to Make Ice Cream Balloons," Depending on how you plan to use this decoration, count the number of balloons you plan to use. The balloon color will end up representing the ice cream itself so dark brown balloons could be chocolate, white might be vanilla, pink could become strawberry, etc.


Consider the balloon size in relation to how you will build the cone. The cone will simply be made from butcher block paper that has been rolled into a cone so make sure the cone and balloon match.
Select balloon colors based on your overall theme (if you have one). Choose colors that will compliment and not overpower the room or area you plan to decorate.;
, While you can blow up the balloons the old fashioned way (using your own air), the only way they will stand upright is to use helium.


Set blown up balloons in a large plastic bag or in an area where they won’t float or blow away.

, Cut out a large rectangle from the butcher block paper. For a standard size balloon, cut out a rectangle that is approximately 12"" x 6"". You want the top of the cone to hold the balloon in place nicely.


Shape the cut piece of butcher block paper into a cone shape with a pointed bottom and open-mouthed top.
Add pieces of clear tape along the seam to hold in place.

, Once you've made sure the balloon fits in place (and looks good), add clear pieces of rolled tape along the inside of the cone. The tape should be close enough to the inside edge so the base of the balloon is held in place.


Be sure you tape the balloon with the knotted side of the balloon facing inside the cone.

, Thread a piece of ribbon through the hole and tie a knot toward the top. The ribbon should keep the entire ice cream cone in tact and able to tie on a chair or gift.

Line a sink with damp fabric.,
Mix 200g of washing soda in a jug of boiling water.",How to Space Dye1," Holding the containers, carefully mix approximately 1 teaspoon of dye powder in a small amount of lukewarm water. (If you are using a Dylon tin, sellotape the remainder closed and put into a plastic bag.) Mix to a paste and then add up to 100ml of water. Wear a mask for this stage. The fabric in the sink is to catch any dye spillages. It can be added to the dye baths later. If your containers have tops, screw them on and put to one side., Stir until it is dissolved. Make up to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of solution by adding extra water.

Start with a clean piece of fabric.,
Purchase a bar of natural beeswax.,
Heat the wax and cloths a little.,
Rub the beeswax across the fabric in both directions.,
Spread the wax out with your fingers to make it move even.,
Heat the item again with a hair dryer for about five minutes.,
Smooth the item again with your fingers, if necessary.,
Set the item to cure in a warm, dry place.",How to Waterproof Fabric5," If the fabric you are working with is dirty, then wash it and let it dry completely. This method will work best on canvas shoes and bags., You might want to use pure beeswax for this, without any additives. Anything else may contain harmful chemicals., You can do this by blowing them with a hairdryer or leaving them out in the hot sun for a few minutes. This will make the wax easier to apply. You do not want the clothes to be hot, and you do not want the wax to be melted., Rub it side-to-side and up-and-down. This will help the wax get into the weave of the fabric.If you are covering a piece of clothing or a bag, use the corners of the wax to get into small seams and spaces., Gently rub the wax into small, tight areas, such as seams, corners, and pockets. If the item you are covering has buttons, make sure to wipe the wax off., This will allow the wax to melt into the fabric. You will see the fabric becoming a little darker., If there are any pools or puddles of wax, run your fingers across the fabric in circular motions to smooth it out. This will give your piece a nice finish., Leave it there for 24 hours.After this time, the waxed article will be ready to use. You may notice that the fabric is a little stiffer and darker than before. This is normal. The fabric will soften with time, but it won't get lighter again."

Purchase some linseed oil.,
Start applying the linseed oil onto the fabric in a thick layer.,
Wait 30 minutes before wiping any oil residue off with a clean rag.,
Let the fabric dry for 24 hours, then repeat the process.Once the fabric has dried, get out your linseed oil again, and apply more of it to the fabric.,
Consider painting your fabric using oil paint between layers of linseed oil.",How to Waterproof Fabric6," If the fabric is dirty, you will need to wash it and let it dry completely., Linseed oil can get pungent, so the extra ventilation might help keep you from feeling lightheaded. If you are working outside, make sure that the area is free of dust and that there is no wind, or you might end up with dust particles embedded in your finished piece. If you cannot work outside, then make sure that you have a window open., You can use a cheap picture frame with the glass and cardboard backing taken out. Make sure that the fabric covers the entire frame. If the fabric is too big for the frame, then you will need to work on it in parts., You can also use jojoba oil. It is a little lighter than linseed oil, which might make it easier to work with., You want the fabric to be completely saturated with the oil. Don't worry if it feels like you are using too much; you will be wiping the excess off. You can apply the oil with a wide, boar bristle paintbrush or with a rag.

Avoid using a brush made from camel hair. The soft bristles will be too weak to spread the oil.
If the oil came in a small bottle, then consider pouring it into a large cup,

, This will give the oil enough time to soak into the fabric and saturate it. After this time, you may notice some residue on the surface of the fabric. Use a clean cloth to wipe it off., Wait 30 minutes, then wipe the excess oil off using a clean rag. You can add one or two more layers., Use an oil painting paintbrush to apply the oil paint. These brushes are usually made out of stiff bristles, such as boar bristles or Taklon, which is synthetic. Apply the linseed oil with a brush instead of a rag so that you do not blur your design."

Pour washing soda solution over the fabric, making sure all areas of fabric are in contact with the solution.,
Take the container to the sink and pour excess dye away.",How to Space Dye2," Soak in a bucket or sink of plain water for 15 minutes.
, If you use jam jars just push half the fabric into the jar and leave the rest hanging out., It helps to drip a different colour down each side of the jar. Then push more fabric in and drip more dye into the jar., Add more dye if there are still white areas. Leave for at least 15 minutes and preferably longer., You don’t want the fabric swimming in solution, just damped by it. Leave for 45 minutes. It will not harm if it is left for longer – in fact the longer it is left the more time the dye has to bond to the fabric., Fill the container with water, pull out the fabric and rinse very well. At this stage the dyes will still contaminate other fabrics so if you have a lovely yellow piece do not rinse with a dark blue piece or sections will go green. Keep rinsing until the water runs clear. Then rinse again in hot water, again until the water runs clear. Finally, put through a hot wash or rinse in the washing machine. Hang out to dry and iron when slightly damp.

, Tie this knot above where you just tied the neck of the weather balloon with itself. Cut a piece of string 8"" long and use it to tie off the balloon.

, Cut a 10 foot (3 m) long string. Tie one end of the string to the handle of the payload container. Then tie the other end of the string to the neck of the balloon.

, If the shed you used to construct it is at the destination chosen to release the project, all that is left is for you and your friend to step outside of the shed and to release it! If the shed isn't at the destination that was selected, drive to the destination and release it there. Either way, have fun watching it ascend!

Clean your silkscreen frame with a unbinding solvent like acetone.,Peel the used mesh off the frame after the acetone solvent has been used to clean the adhesive off.,
Use 80-grit sandpaper to roughen up the areas of your frame that will be glued, if your frame is wooden.,Wipe the frame with a tack cloth.,
Choose an adhesive.,
Cut a new piece of mesh to size that is slightly bigger than the frame.,
Place the frame on wooden blocks in the middle of your screen stretching machine or device.,Place the mesh over the frame and insert it into the tension bars on your stretching device.,Increase the tension slowly, checking the tension with a mesh tension meter, until you have reached the tension that was last used on the frame.,
Apply a thin coat of adhesive where the fabric attaches to the frame using a plastic applicator or a tongue depressor.,
Allow the adhesive to dry and cure according to package instructions.,
Use weights on top of the drying frame to ensure it does not warp or bend.,
Remove the tension bars and cut any excess mesh surrounding the frame.",How to Restretch a Silkscreen Frame With Adhesive," This will remove ink, oil, dirt and remaining adhesive from your frame.
,, It helps overall adhesion by creating places on which the glue can easily attach and hold.

Aluminum frames do not need to be sanded.

,, They are often identified by low and high viscosity, and what you need will depend on your mesh count. There are many trade grades of adhesive available for mesh counts from 110 to 355. Ask your printing supplier for recommendations. The right adhesive is essential to bond the fabric to the frame., Mesh is sold by the meter., The wooden blocks will increase the tension between the stretching device and the mesh.,,, A thick coat increases drying time and may not dry correctly. Add another thin coat if you feel that the first coat was not strong enough.,

If you have chosen to activate the adhesive with cyanoacrylate adhesive, a substance similar to super glue, be sure to mist it very lightly, or it could adversely affect the glue's adhesion.
This glue is often referred to as s a ""kicker"" because it is a quick and secure way to bond the glue. However, it is harder to control than the liquid adhesive. Make sure not to cover too much of your mesh with the ""kicker.""

, A warped frame would unevenly distribute ink during silk screening., Now you can add your stencil and begin printing."

Get a plain t-shirt and wash to remove any shrinking.,
Set up your work area.,
Place a piece of cardboard inside the T-shirt.,
Paint your design using fabric paint.,
Let the paint dry.,
Remove the cardboard.,
Finished.

",How to Paint a T Shirt1," Even if the label on your shirt says ""pre-shrunk,"" it would still be a good idea to wash it. This will remove any potential starch or stiffener that might prevent the paint from sticking properly.;
, Spread some newspaper on a table, and get anything that might get ruined out of the way. It might also be a good idea to have some paper towels (for blotting) and a cup of water (for rinsing the paintbrush) handy as well.

, The cardboard should be about the same size as the shirt. You want it to slip inside the shirt easily without stretching it. This will prevent the paint from bleeding onto the back of the shirt.


You can also use a folded up newspaper for this. Even an old magazine or catalogue will do in a pinch.

, If you are nervous about free-handing the design, you can always trace your design first using a stencil and a permanent marker, and then fill it in. Consider using a few paintbrushes in different shapes and sizes; a flat brush will give you some nice, crisp edges while a pointy brush is great for detail.


If you want your design to have multiple colors, such as a smiles face, do the background color first. Let the paint dry, then do the details.
Try to get paint brushes meant for painting fabric. They usually have stiffer bristles made from taklon. Avoid natural brushes, such as camel hair, as they will be too soft to hold the thick paint and create nice designs.

, If you'd like, you can speed up the drying process by blowing the paint with a hair dryer. Do not remove the cardboard inside the shirt until the paint is completely dry.


Once the paint dries, you can flip it around and paint the back as well. Keep the cardboard inside the shirt and let the paint dry.

, If the paint is sticking to the cardboard, don't panic. Simply wiggle your finger between the shirt and the cardboard to pry it apart. Discard the cardboard when you are done, or save it for another project.

Dab your foam brush into the paint.,
Tap the paint onto the stencil.Keep dabbing and tapping until you get the coverage you want.,
Remove the stencil before the paint dries.,
Let the paint dry completely, then set the paint using a clothing iron, if desired.,
Remove the cardboard from inside the shirt.",How to Paint a T Shirt2," This will remove any potential shrinking and starch. It will make the paint stick to the shirt better.

, Cover up your table with lots of newspaper. You might also want to have some paper towels, cups filled with water, and paper plates (or palettes) handy.

, This will keep the paint front transferring to the back of the shirt. If you don't have any cardboard, you can also use a folded up newspaper or an old magazine. Be sure to smooth out any wrinkles.

, You can use a fabric painting stencil, a regular stencil, or you can make your own out of thin plastic, freezer paper, or cardstock. You can even use painter's tape to create geometric designs! Make sure that the stencil is laying flat against the shirt, or the paint will bleed under the edges.


If you are using a stencil meant for painting fabric, it will likely have a sticky back. All you have to do is smooth it down.
If you are using a regular stencil, or if you made your own, coat the back of the stencil with repositionable adhesive spray, then press the stencil down.If you are using freezer paper, iron the paper shiny-side-down onto the t-shirt. Peel it away after you paint the shirt., If you'd like to work with multiple colors, it might be a good idea to use a larger plate, or a several smaller plates—one for each color.

, You can also apply the paint using a mini paint roller (preferably rubber).Lastly, you can also use a paintbrush. This will be great for delicate stencils.

, If you are using a paint roller, simply roll it on. Try to work inwards, going from the stencil's edges towards the middle. This will prevent the paint from accidentally leaking under the stencil., Fabric paint will form a thick layer as it dries, and if you remove it too late, you will run the risk of the paint tearing.

, This will give you a longer lasting design. Place a piece of cotton fabric over the design, then press an iron over it., Now your shirt is ready to wear and show off!

Wash your t-shirt to remove any shrinking.Even if your shirt says ""pre-shrunk"" on it, it would still be a good idea to wash it.,
Tuck a folded up newspaper or cardboard inside the shirt.,
Position your stencil, and secure, if necessary.,
Move to a well-ventilated area and get set up.,

Let the paint dry for 15 minutes before doing a second coat.You can speed up the drying process with a hairdryer.,
Let the paint dry for another 10 to 15 minutes before removing the stencil and newspaper/cardboard.,
Let the shirt finish drying for a few more minutes.Once the shirt is dry, you can pull the cardboard out and wear your shirt.

",How to Paint a T Shirt3," T-shirts are also coated with a starchy material to help them lay more smoothly in the store. This starchy material can prevent paint from sticking.

, This will keep the spray paint from bleeding onto the back of the shirt. The newspaper or cardboard should be big enough to fit inside the shirt without stretching it. Be sure to smooth out any wrinkles of ripples., You can use a stencil meant for fabric painting, or a regular stencil. You can also make your own out of thin plastic, freezer paper, or cardstock. You can even use painter's tape to create chevron stripes! Make sure that the stencil is laying flat against the fabric. If it isn't, the paint will seep under the edges and create a blurred design.


If you are using a fabric painting stencil, it will probably have a sticky back. Simply press it onto the shirt and smooth it down.
If you are using a regular stencil, or if you made your own, spray the back of the stencil with repositionable adhesive spray, then press it down onto the shirt.
If you are using freezer paper, simply place the stencil shiny-side-down onto the shirt, then run a clothing iron over it.

, Ideally, you should work outside, but if you can't, a large room with lots of open windows might do. Cover your work area with lots of newspaper, and put on some old clothes or an apron. Lastly, consider putting on a pair of plastic gloves; spray painting can get messy.If you are working indoors and start to feel lightheaded, take a break and go outside for some fresh air.

, Shake the can for 30 to 60 seconds first, then hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the stencil. Spray the paint on using a long, sweeping motion. Don't worry if the paint is not thick enough. You can always do another layer or two.


Consider spraying the design using clear sealer first. This will give you better control over the paint and prevent it from soaking into the fabric. Be sure to let the sealer dry before applying the paint., Once the paint is dry, spray on a second coat; you should see the paint going on thicker now. If you'd like, you can do a partial layer instead using a different color for a tie-dye effect.

, Be very careful when removing the stencil, as some of the paint might still be wet, especially towards the edges.Unlike with fabric paint, you can let spray paint dry before removing the stencil. This is because spray paint doesn't form a thick layer that might tear—like fabric paint does.

",How to Make a Twine Ball Light Garland," This means you don’t want to fully inflate balloons but instead make sure they become the size you desire for the garland.


Tie the end of each balloon.





;
, Using your Sharpie marker, draw a small circle around the top (opposite side from your knot) so you know how far your garland will be wrapped.


Wipe a thin coating of petroleum jelly all over the balloon surface. The jelly is important as it will prevent the twine from ultimately sticking to the balloons.







, Prop the broom handle across two chairs. You’ll need to size up the handle to determine how far apart the chairs should be situated.


Tie a piece of string around the balloon knot and tie it around the broom handle so that the balloons are hanging.
Lay your drop cloth underneath the balloons in preparation to catch any errant glue mixture.

, Combine PVA glue with 2 tbsp. cornstarch and 2 tbsp. warm water. Mix well.


Add more warm water as needed. You want the glue to be smooth but not too runny.

, Make sure the twine is thoroughly soaked so you may need to submerge and dip it in and out of the glue until each area is completely covered.

, Run the twine around horizontally and vertically until the balloon is well covered.


Don’t forget to avoid the area you already marked off with the Sharpie marker--that part should be left alone.
Cut the end of the twine when finished with the first balloon and press twine in place. Then start on the next balloon repeating the winding process.

, Place drying balloons in a cool, dry area for best results. Humid and wet will only mean that you will need additional dry time.


Test twine balls before popping balloons by touching them for hardness and dryness.

, Carefully extract the balloon from inside the twine ball.

, String balls together using the clear fishing wire first. Then add your twinkle lights.


Thread lights through the tops of each ball (where the balloon knot once was). Make sure the light is pointed down, through the ball so light comes through the other side.
Intertwine the fishing wire with the twinkle lights so you ultimately have one strand.

Place it in a table cutter and clamp the pipe. Adjust the blades just halfway of the sides of the pipe. Start the cutter and cut the marks. Use your left hand to rotate the pipe and your right hand to hold the pipe as a help for the clamp. Get 2 pieces of #219 O-rings and insert it onto the cut marks. Get a 1"" plug and insert it into the pipe (where two o-rings are located) with PVC glue.;
, Clean up the piston to wipe out the excess glue.

, It is too long because it is 26 inches (66.0 cm). This will be the handles we will use later on. Paint all the fittings with blue and black or desired colour, except for the pump.

, First, insert the coupling into the bushing and insert the bigger pipe to that and make sure it goes to the bottom.

, But, don't attach it yet to the body (Step 4).

, Insert it into the bigger pipe. Cement the cap on top when inserted and left 2 inches (5.1 cm) where we will attach the handles.


If you wonder how I make the cap, just bore a hole in a 1-1/4 Slip Cap. Insert the #320 O-ring into the side (just the side, not the centre) and use lubricating jelly and insert into the pipe with the pump in the centre and this will be the cap.

, Now, make a One-Way valve to make it a really pump.

Keep holding the bag until it fills up and stands on its own.,
Let go of the bag.",How to Make a Mini Flyable Hot Air Balloon with Candles," The best bag for this is a thin, cheap, trashcan liner. It should be translucent or clear. Do not use a regular trash bag; it will be too heavy. You can also use a dry cleaning bag instead. If you do, make sure that it is the short kind used for shirts; be sure to tape the hole at the top of the bag.


Do not use plastic grocery bags. They are too small and too heavy.;
, Place the opening of the bag in front of a small fan. Make sure that there are no gaps. Turn the fan on. The bag should fill up like a balloon. If it does not fill up, it may have some holes. Find these holes and cover them with a piece of scotch tape., The day should be cool; the balloon will not fly well on a hot day.Make sure that there is no wind; even the slightest breeze will keep the balloon from flying. The best time to fly would be at dawn or dusk as the weather is the most still.Cold, winter days with high pressure are the best for flying.

, You can also fly your balloon inside. Make sure that there is a lot of space, and that there are no curtains or carpets inside. If the balloon lands close to one of those, you could start a fire. A great place to fly is in a garage or a school gym.

, You will be working with fire, so you want to be safe. If you are a child, make sure that you have an adult with you at all times.

, The edges will be sharp, so be careful.

, Each dot should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from each corner. You will be placing your candles on these dots.








, This will make the balloon lighter and easier to fly.







, You may have noticed that two of the candle pieces still have the wick sticking out, and two do not. Using your fingernail, crumble the tip of those two candles until you have some wick showing. You want to end up with four mini birthday candles.







, Use a lighter to melt the bottom of a candle. Let some of the wax drip onto the dot. Once you have a small pool of wax, stick the candle down onto it. Hold the candle still until the wax hardens. Do this for the other three candles.









If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.

, Be careful not to bump the candles while you are doing this. They will pop off easily. This will help catch any melted or dripping wax from the candles.







, Lay a ruler across the opening of the bag. Write down the length. This will be how long you will be making the sticks for the frame.

, To connect two straws together, cut a small slit into the bottom of a straw. Side the cut part into another straw. Wrap a piece of tape around the joint. Keep doing this until the stick is the same width as the bag.









If you are using bendable straws, cut the bendy part off., Find the middle of one stick. Place the other stick on top of it.








, Do not use too much tape, or the frame will be too heavy. The best tape to use is clear scotch tape. Masking tape will be too heavy.








, Purchase some thin balsa wood sticks from an arts and crafts store. They look like squares or rectangles when you look down at them from the top. Cut the sticks down to the right length. Put a drop of wood glue in the middle of one stick. Place the other stick on top of it, making a cross or X shape. Wait for the glue to dry.


Try to get the thinnest stick possible. It will be the lightest and easiest to fly.
Do not buy dowels; those are not balsa wood and will be too heavy.

, If you look down on the frame and tray, the candles should be between the straws. This is very important. If the candles are over the straws, the heat will burn and melt the straws. It will also distribute the weight the wrong way.








, Take a piece of tape and put it under one of the arms of the X. Press the tape against the bottom of the tray. Do this for the other three arms and sides of the tray.








, Tape one corner of the bag to one of the ends of the frame. Tape the opposite corner of the bag to the other end of the frame. Do this for the other two sides. You are making a square-shaped hole.








, You can also tie the string to a table, chair, or fence. This is very important. If you do not do this, the balloon may fly out of reach and get caught. Choose a thin, light string, such as thread.








, Try to keep the bag as loose as possible, It might be easier to do this step and the next step with a friend.

, Be careful so that you do not knock or push any of the candles over or burn the bag. A long, stick lighter might work best for this step. If you are a child, ask an adult to light the candles for you.








, This will take about a minute or so., It will not fly at first, but after a few more moments, it will start to rise on its own. Be sure to keep holding onto the string, or attach the string to something. The balloon will float for as long as the candles are lit.

Decide on the look you’re going for.,
Tie twine to one or more inflated balloons.,
Trim silk flower ends to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).,
Trim green-leaf stems to be between 3 inches (7.6 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm).,
Attach leaves to the base of your balloon.,
Wrap floral tape around the greenery ends.,
Attach 2 to 3 flowers underneath the greenery.,
Continue attaching flowers and greenery to the twine.,
Decorate a room with your floral balloons.",How to Make a Floral Balloon1," Do you want several single white balloons all with decorated floral stems, or do you want to tie several balloons together to make a single stem? Decide on how many balloon strings you want to decorate. , After you decide on how many balloons you want together, blow them up by hand or with the help of an air pump. Then, tie a single piece of twine around the balloon ends. Tie the end of the twine into a double knot by tying the end a second time or try a slip knot., Use a variety of silk flowers and green leaves that falls in line with your color scheme. Since you’ll be attaching the arrangement to the twine on the balloons with floral tape, you need to trim long stems. Trim long stems on flowers so that only 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) is left. For example:


You could use several different types of pale pink flowers and green leaves with a white balloon.
You could use similar flowers in different shades of the same color with balloons in a complementary color.
You could use silk violets, hibiscus and gardenia flowers for a tropical themed party., You’ll probably want some greenery on your floral balloon. Silk greenery is sold like flowers, except with leaves attached to one half of the stem. Determine how long you want leaves to hang from your balloon and trim accordingly. Trim the greenery so that between 3 inches (7.6 cm) and 6 inches (15 cm) of leaves are left.

, Start your arrangement by attaching two pieces of greenery to the base of your balloon to hide the tied piece of twine. Attach the ends of your greenery onto the twine just under the balloon with clear, shipping tape., Reinforce the tape you used to attach the greenery by wrapping floral tape around their ends.The floral tape will also make your floral balloon stem look complete after all is said and done. If you have heavier flowers or greenery, consider using a dollop of hot glue underneath the floral tape for a stronger hold., After you attach greenery to the base of your balloon, you should have a feel for how your floral balloon should look. Attach 2 to 3 flower heads right under the greenery using the same attachment methods described above.

, Alternate between greenery and flowers through the length of the twine, until the end is as long as you’d like. The length should be anywhere between 6 inches (15 cm) and 12 inches (30 cm).

, Arrange and decorate your freshly made floral balloons in a reception or party space. Place three to five balloons in the corners of a room or tie stings to a weight and place them in the middle of tables.

Use an air pump to blow up balloons in a variety of sizes.,
Trim flower stems to be between 7 inches (18 cm) and 9 inches (23 cm).,
Attach balloons to the chicken wire with packing tape.,
Paste the sides of balloons together with Elmer’s glue.,
Hang your balloon arrangement above eye level.,
Place stemmed flowers into the arrangement.",How to Make a Floral Balloon2," You’re going to need lots of balloons and flowers for this project. Go to your local party supply and purchase balloons in bulk that you can blow up yourself. For the flowers, check with your area discount grocery store on fresh flower prices and purchase a variety of 3 to 6 bunches.


If your budget doesn't allow fresh flowers, use silk ones.

, Obtain some chicken wire netting at your local hardware or farm-and-feed store. Measure out how large you want your floral balloon backdrop. Most chicken wire is sold rolled up very long and 2 feet (0.61 m) tall. Unroll anywhere between 2 feet (0.61 m) to 4 feet (1.2 m) and cut the netting with wire cutters forming a square or rectangle., Since chicken wire comes rolled up, you will want to flatten it by firmly pressing the wires down with your hands. Make a work-space to keep it flat by using thumb tacks on an area of wall you don’t mind having tack marks. Keeping the wire spread out will make it easier to work with.

, Save your breath and blow all the balloons for this project up with a balloon pump or air compressor. Any party supply store should sell a hand held balloon pump in addition to balloons. Blow balloons up to different large, medium and small sizes to entirely cover the netting and fill in any gaps., You will be interspersing flowers throughout the balloons attached to the wire netting, so the right flower length is important. Trim flowers stems down to 7 inches (18 cm) and 9 inches (23 cm) in length. Remove any unwanted leaves., Clear packing tape is durable and sticky enough to hold your balloons onto the wire easily. Place the tied ends of your balloons onto the wire and tape the balloon tails onto it. Attach the largest balloons first and fill in gaps with ones in decreasing sizes.

, Just in case your balloons want to flop around and not cooperate, use Elmer’s glue to hold them up. Use a drop or two on each side of the balloons you want to glue and hold the sides together for about 30 seconds.

, Since you’ll be taking pictures in front of your floral balloon, hang it on the wall slightly above eye level using a self-adhesive disposable hook. Measure about 5 feet (1.5 m) from the ground and hang the center of your balloon netting from the hook. The arrangement will be light enough to use a hook option that doesn’t damage the wall and will work great at venues where you can’t drill holes., Bring the balloons to life by placing your trimmed flowers all around them. Insert the stems of flowers between the balloons and past the wire netting. Use different types of flowers and plants, like roses, baby's breath and eucalyptus.

Place your balloon arch in the desired area.",How to Make a Floral Balloon3," A balloon decorating strip has perforated holes to attach the tied ends of balloons to and it will naturally arch up as you fill it up. Purchase balloon decorating strip anywhere that sells party supplies. Then, measure and cut how long you’d like your final arch to be. You will need at least 12 feet (3.7 m), Before you start filling up the decorating strip with balloons, hang it on the wall in an arch shape. Use a staple gun to hang it and make extra curves in your arch if you want to. If you want to move the arch somewhere else, be gentle relocating it.

, Blow up balloons of various sizes to fill up the arch with. Use an air pump or your lungs if you have enough breath.

, You don’t want to weigh your arch down with heavy flowers. Silk flowers will work great as long as they don’t have a lot of heavy plastic. Look for vines to hang from the arch and lightweight silk flowers. Use fresh flowers if you have the money to spend.

, It’s easy to attach balloons to a decorating strip. Simply pull the tied end of each balloon through the holes on the strip. Start with the largest sized balloons and work your way down to the smallest. Glue extra-small balloons to larger balloons with Elmer’s glue., Decorate the balloon arch with flowers and greenery by arranging greenery through the spaces between the balloons first. Space vines apart equally and pull the ends through the back so that several inches or centimeters lay over the front. Place the flowers similarly, being careful to show off the top of each flower.

, Tie 6 inches (15 cm) of twine to the base of a flower, pull the string around the decorating strip, then tie and hide the end behind a balloon.

, Make sure your floral balloon arch is arranged nicely by double-checking the placement of the balloons and flowers. Be careful not to have too many of the same kind of flowers or too many similarly sized balloons in one spot.

, Keep the arch on the wall or stand it up in a room. A balloon arch is a great place to take pictures under or in front of.

Build a pad for the ignited cotton to rest upon.,
Create an edge using foil around the diameter of the pad.,
Build the base of the balloon out of two thin pieces of balsa wood, each approximately one foot in length.,
Completely open the bag you are using for your balloon.

,
Tape the frame to the bag.,
Soak your cotton ball in rubbing alcohol.

,
Place the cotton ball within the foil pad, safely light it, and launch your balloon!

",How to Make a Fire Balloon," Take a cardboard square and wrap foil completely around it. Don't use to much foil, as this will make the balloon too heavy.;
, Make sure the edge is tall enough to prevent the cotton ball from falling off.

,


Mark the six-inch point on each piece.






Tape the balsa frame to the cardboard/foil pad, making a plus-sign shape with each balsa strip meeting at the center six-inch mark.







,, Keep in mind that the foil edge should be facing towards the upper/closed part of the bag.

Use flour for a soft and malleable ball.,
Use dried beans or birdseed for a firmer ball.,
Try modeling clay or playdough.,
Observe safety precautions while filling balloons.,
Stretch out a standard party balloon.,
Insert a funnel into the neck of the balloon.,
Pour in the filling.,
Cut off the excess balloon.,
Wrap with a second balloon.,
Decorate the outer balloon if desired.",How to Make a Balloon Stress Ball," Pour all-purpose flour for baking into your balloon for your stress ball. This creates a ball that is soft and squishy and will more or less hold the shape you form it into.


You can also use other common powdered baking ingredients that you have on hand, like cornstarch or baking soda. Or use sand, if you have it available, for a slightly grainier texture.
Note that this filling can be messier if spills occur, but it is popular for its low expense and the satisfying texture it creates for a stress ball.;
, Try small dry beans, lentils, rice, or birdseed to fill your balloon for the stress ball. This creates a firmer, more textured ball, like a bean bag.


This type of filling doesn’t create as squishy of a ball, but it can be easier to get into the balloon and creates less of a mess if spilled.
Note that birdseed or dry goods may have sharp or cracked fragments that could create a hole in the balloon for your stress ball. Prevent this by using several layers of balloons to make a thicker surface for your stress ball, or opting for a smoother filling material instead.
You can also mix dry beans with flour for a filling that is a mixture of firm and soft. Try half beans and half flour, or whatever combination creates a texture you like.

, Use a modeling clay product or playdough to put into your balloon. This creates a stress ball that is very squishy and holds its shape well.


Be aware that many modeling clays and play doughs will dry up over time when left exposed to the air. Though you will be putting it inside a tied balloon, it may not be completely airtight and your stress ball could harden after a couple days or weeks.
Note that solids like modeling clay or playdough can be more difficult to get into a balloon successfully. Use a funnel as with any other filling, and roll the clay or dough into thin snakes to help get it through and into the balloon., Use caution when performing the pouring and cutting required in filling party balloons. Adults should supervise or perform parts of this process for children.


Use scissors carefully when cutting balloons. You can also avoid spills of the filling by laying down newspaper or another covering over your work area.
Take care if you have a latex allergy, in which case you should opt for balloons made of Mylar or another material instead of the common latex.
Adults should handle balloons for infants and toddlers, as balloons and balloon pieces are a choking hazard., Use your fingers to gently stretch out a latex balloon in all directions. This will make the material of the balloon more flexible for filling.


You can also blow up the balloon slightly with your mouth to stretch the material.
Make sure to stretch out the neck of the balloon, which will be crucial in getting your filling to pour through it easily.

, Put a funnel into the neck of the balloon to pour filling in easier. You may be able to roll the neck of the balloon over the tip of the funnel so it holds itself there securely.


If you don’t have a plastic or metal funnel on hand, simply roll a piece of paper into a cone shape. Make sure the small end is narrow enough to fit into the neck of your balloon but wide enough to let your filling material through. Tape your paper funnel together so it doesn’t unroll while filling.
You can also make your own funnel by cutting the top half of a water bottle off and using the mouth of the bottle to put into the balloon., Use about ¼ cup of your preferred filling material to pour into the balloon.Hold your funnel steady and pour carefully to avoid spills.


If the filling gets trapped in the funnel during pouring, gently shake the balloon to settle the contents, or help push the filling through with a pencil.Fill the round portion of the balloon with filling, no further than the base of the neck. A fuller balloon will create a firmer stress ball, while a less full balloon will create a softer, squishier one.
Tie off the neck of the balloon tightly by making a knot in the rubber. You can double knot it for extra security.

, Carefully cut off the excess neck of the balloon above the knot you made to close it. This will make for a smoother ball when you add another balloon.


Be carefully when cutting the excess that you don’t cut into the knot itself, or any other part of the balloon.
For a perfectly round and smooth ball, you can actually hold the balloon very carefully and cut the neck off completely so there is no knot. Then you must cover the hole immediately with another balloon to seal it., Cut the neck off of another balloon, then stretch the opening wide and fit it around your filled and tied balloon. This keeps it secure and less likely to break or spill.


Cut more from the top of your balloon to create a wider hole if you have trouble fitting it over your ball. Note that the hole will be obvious if you use two different colors for the first and second balloon.
Put your cut balloon over the knot of the first balloon to cover it and keep the surface of your ball more smooth.
You can put as many layers of additional balloons on your ball as you want for extra security. Note that your ball will become firmer and less squishy the more balloon layers you put on.

, Adorn your stress ball with images, words, or other decorations that will make you happy and contribute to reducing stress. You can use pens, markers, or anything else that will stick to the surface of the balloon.


Try cutting shapes into the top balloon layer before you pull it over the ball. If you use a different color as the balloon underneath, this creates an interesting contrasting pattern.Try drawing a happy face on your stress ball, or some inspiring words that will help you relax or de-stress.

Make a balloon pet using a blown-up balloon.,
Make a balloon dog.,
Make a balloon fish.,
Make a balloon puppy.",How to Make a Balloon Pet1," There are lots of possibilities here, so this section will provide a few suggestions and you can experiment with your own as well.;
, Choose a balloon in the color you'd like the dog to be, such as brown, white, black, grey or any other color.


Blow up the balloon with helium gas. Tie it into a knot, to keep the gas in place.
Draw floppy ear shapes onto two pieces of card. Color in (if needed), then cut these out. Attach using glue to each side of the balloon, at the non-knotted end.
Draw the face directly onto the balloon. Draw a kidney shape facing downward for the snout and draw a circle in the middle for the dog's nose. Draw large eyes above the snout and blacken them in.
Tie a string on the base. The dog balloon can now be played with or used as a party decoration.

, Choose an orange or yellow balloon for making the fish.


Blow up the balloon. You can use air or helium gas, whichever is easiest. Tie a knot in it, to keep the air in place.
Draw two fin shapes on orange or yellow card. Cut these out. Attach them with glue to the sides of the balloon, with the back of the fins facing toward the knotted end of the balloon.
Cut out a tail fin from the orange or yellow card. Glue over the knotted area of the balloon.
Stick on two large eyes made from card. Or, simply draw these on with markers.
The fish balloon is now ready for play or to be placed out as a decoration for a party.

, This is a fun one for the kids to drag around with them, and is easier if you only have air rather than helium for filling the balloons.


Blow up the balloon. Tie a knot in it, to keep the air in place. (Air is best as it allows the balloon puppy to hover around the kid's feet as it is being walked.)
At the knot end of the balloon, create the dog's face. Draw a round nose just above the knot and blacken it in. Draw a smiling mouth (two semi circle arcs either side of the knot). Draw whisker dots above each smile arc (about four is sufficient).
Either attach floppy ears made from card, or draw them on the dog. They look more effective if made from card though.
Cut out a length of string or cord. Tie onto the balloon knot. This becomes the puppy's leash.
Allow the kids to take the balloon puppy for a walk.

, Any color is fine, these ""pets"" can be all colors of the rainbow.

, Stretch it back and forth to make the opening a little looser. This will help placing the filling inside.

, This can be either sand or play dough, depending on your preference. Kids tend to like the play dough because it can be shaped into all sorts of funny configurations that keep their shape after molding.

, Ensure that the sand or play dough do not come into the neck area of the balloon; if you have overfilled it, remove some of the filling, to allow you to tie a knot in the balloon.

, Draw eyes, a smile, a nose, freckles, etc. It's fun to let the kids do this for themselves, as they can style the face in their own way.

, This step is optional but can make the pet look funnier. Add small spikes of yarn to the knot end of the balloon; glue to attach. Keep these pieces short, so that they stand up.

, The balloon pet is now ready for play or stress relief.

Set up the balloons individually or in bunches.,
Buy or make balloon weights.",How to Inflate a Helium Balloon," Multiply the amount of cubic feet of helium required for your balloon size by the amount of balloons you want to fill. Since there are various balloon sizes and helium tank sizes, you may want to consult an online chart to figure out the tank size you want.


For example, a standard-sized balloon, eleven inches in size, requires .50 cu. ft. of helium. A 50 cu. ft. helium tank can therefore fill 100 eleven-inch balloons, because .50 (amount of cu. ft. required per balloon) x 100 (amount of balloons desired) = 50 (size of tank in cu. ft.).;
, You can buy these or rent them from party supply stores. If you will be blowing up lots of helium balloons often, consider buying one. But if this is a one-time thing, rent one instead. Party stores typically offer helium tanks you can rent for up to three days. You may be able to negotiate a longer time frame, or you could simply go to one of the stores which offer longer-term rentals.Purchasing a tank with between eight and fourteen cubic feet of helium in it costs around $40 to $60. Renting a helium tank ranges from about $25 for 14 cubic feet of helium up to a little over $200 for 291 cubic feet of helium (enough to fill about 525 eleven-inch balloons).
Return the item to the store by the time agreed upon when you rented it, so that you don’t get charged an extra fee. A safety deposit may be required and late returns may result in a dock from your deposit.

, How long your balloons stay afloat can vary based on temperature, humidity and altitude. In general, foil or “Mylar” balloons stay suspended in the air between two and fourteen days, whereas latex versions stay afloat for four to sixteen hours., Rotate the inflator onto the nozzle by turning the inflator clockwise as you face the tank.Continue to screw on the inflator until it’s tightly attached., For latex balloons, attach the larger, cone-shaped adapter. For foil balloons, attach the smaller, screw-shaped adapter at the tip of the latex adapter. Make sure the appropriate adapter is connected to the inflator., The tank should have a release knob that looks similar to the faucet handle for a garden hose. Turn the knob counter-clockwise., Roll the mouth of the balloon a bit down on the nozzle. While holding the end of the balloon onto the nozzle with one hand, use your other hand to press down on the nozzle to release the helium. The balloon will inflate quickly, so be ready to remove it.If nothing happens when you press down on the nozzle, try activating the helium by pressing upward on the nozzle instead.
Don’t overfill the balloon. Latex balloons should have a round shape when inflated. Balloons shaped like pears or light bulbs are overinflated and more likely to burst. They also use up more helium, so that you will get less filled balloons.

, Gradually let up on the nozzle as the balloon starts to get full. Pinch the end of the balloon and slowly take it off of the valve. Tie a tight knot in the neck of the balloon., Take a piece of ribbon and place it around the neck of the balloon, above the knot. If you want to curl the shorter end of the ribbon, leave some ribbon hanging on that end. The other end should remain long. Tie a knot in the ribbon.Tying the ribbon at the neck of the balloon, instead of below the knot, will give the helium extra security from leakage so that your balloon remains afloat longer.

, Locate the opening on the tab located at the “tail” end of the balloon. Slip the valve over the nozzle adapter until it fits tightly on. Firmly hold the balloon around the adapter and press the nozzle.The balloon is finished inflating when most of the wrinkles have disappeared. Foil balloons don’t expand, so there will be some wrinkles. They will pop if you overinflate them., Foil balloons seal automatically, so all you have to do is pinch the valve flat. Don’t tie a ribbon around the valve or neck of the balloon. This can result in air leakage., Make sure to put it through the tab or hole below the balloon’s valve. Make the ribbon long on one side and short on the other as you tie the knot. Afterwards, you can curl the ribbon and add a sandbag., Push a long straw through the opening of the balloon. Press down carefully until all of the air has left the balloon. Fold the balloon without creasing it, and store it., A good length for balloon ribbons is 48 to 57 inches (120 to 140 cm) per balloon.You can match the ribbon color to the balloon color, or opt for a neutral like ivory or white. Formal occasions like weddings and anniversaries generally use the latter., Pinch the scissor blade against the dull side of the ribbon with one hand. With the other hand, pull the length of the ribbon tautly across the scissor blade in one long stroke. Repeat if the ribbon doesn’t curl on the first attempt.

, Placing balloons in very large or small bunches may reduce their impact. Consider arranging balloons in bunches the size of five to eight balloons apiece.You may want to mix balloon colors, or even use bunches that contain both foil and helium balloons.

, Buy balloon weights at party stores or discount store retailers. To make balloon weights, pour sand onto a sheet of mylar paper and secure it with curled ribbon.For making your own balloon weights, cut sheets of metallic paper down to twelve inches by twelve inches. One cupful of sand should support up to six balloons.
If you’re purchasing balloon weights at a party supply store, an employee should be able to tell you how many balloons their weights can hold. Alternately, consult a helium height and weight chart for balloons."

Hold the bottom of your air balloon over a high-heat source, like an outside burning camp stove.",How to Construct a Hot Air Balloon1," You'll need a large space to work in, so clear a decent-sized area--you'll be working with panels that are 5 feet (1.5 m) long. You'll need:


Tissue paper (24"" by 30"" (61 cm by 76 cm)
Cutting pattern (available at Web Weather for Kids)
Scissors
Straight pins
Rubber cement or glue sticks
Pipe cleaners
Propane stove or other high-heat apparatus;
, This will make one 5 foot (1.5 m) long panel (1.5 m). Use your glue stick or rubber cement to keep the two pieces together. Make sure it's secure! If air escapes, the balloon won't fly.


Do this for seven more panels, for a total of 8 5-foot long panels.
Plan out the order of the colors for the look of your balloon, but don't glue them together just yet.

, Make sure they are straight, so each panel is the same as the others.


Pin the panels together with your straight pins to ensure the tissue doesn't move as you're cutting. This will help prevent rips and tears, which are detrimental to the success of your balloon.

, Use 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlap on each panel, gluing on opposite sides as you go. After you glue all the sides together, it should fold out like a fan.


After you have formed a line of panels, glue the first and last panel together with their open sides. This will form a ring. Make sure glue is placed up and down the entire line of each panel.

, It's easiest to do this with the balloon flat. Glue it over the top hole in the balloon.


It's much better to make this circle too big than just barely big enough. Tissue paper is light enough that an extra inch or two won't affect the weight of your balloon and thus its ability to fly.

, You're going to start with your pipe cleaners to give it permanent structure.


Form the pipe cleaners into a circle the size of the bottom opening.
Position the pipe cleaners on the inside about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge.
Fold the tissue over the pipe cleaners and glue it into place.

If you don't have pipe cleaners, you can use wire. It should be at least 24 inches long (61 cm) and 16 gauge. You will also need wire cutters.



, If there are any precarious spots, fix them now. Patch them with pieces of tissue paper cut to fit.


If you'd like, you can attach a small tag with your name and address now. Tether it to the bottom with fishing line.

, Take a minute to fully allow the hot air balloon to fill with hot air.


A couple of hair dryers will also work, among other things.
You'll feel it start to resist being held down. When it reaches that point, give it a gentle push and watch it fly.

You may find more success in the morning, night, or during winter, depending on your location. Cold weather makes the difference in temperature more stark and thus more effective.

Get organized.,
Decorate the plastic bag.,
Tie a string around the top of the plastic bag.,
Add paper clips around the bottom of the bag.,
Hold the plastic bag over the hair dryer.",How to Construct a Hot Air Balloon2," The process will go a lot faster and smoother if you grab everything you need before you get started. Clear the table to get the process rolling. Have the following items handy:


Plastic bag (""dry cleaners"" bag or 5-gallon trash bag)
Paper clips (used for weight)
Small pieces of paper or stickers (decorations)
String
Scissors
Hair dryer

, It's best to use small pieces of paper or stickers--anything that's lightweight. Glitter is okay, too, though a bit messy.


This part is great for kids. Each child can make their own hot air balloon and design it to uniquely represent them.

, It should resemble the bottom of a standard balloon. Once knotted well and tied, cut off any extra string.

, This may seem counter-intuitive (you need less weight to fly, right?), but it's good for balance and stability.


Don't go overboard. 6 or so per balloon (again, evenly spaced) is a solid number.

, Blast the dryer on high and give it a minute to warm up and fill completely with air.


The bag will start to become buoyant. When it begins tugging, release the bag. The hot air inside the balloon is lighter, causing it to float.
Give the balloon another blast as it begins to fall.

Assemble your work station.,
Cut three pieces of wire.,
Twist the wires together.,
Poke the edges of the wire through the bottom of the bag.,
Attach your fire starters.,
Hold the bag open from the top and light the fire starters.",How to Construct a Hot Air Balloon3," You'll need an open area (with nothing flammable nearby) and your materials:


Plastic garbage bag (The cheaper the better--they should be very lightweight. 20 liters is not too big, either.)
Fire starters (Original Zip works very well)
Mechanical wire (around 18 gauge)

, One should be much shorter than the others--about 4 inches long (10 cm). The other two should be 24 inches long (61 cm).

, Using the long wires, form an ""X,"" twisting them around each other like you would a twist tie. 5 or 6 times should do the trick. This structure will keep the bag open as it flies.


Twist the short wire around the center of the X. Leave the ends exposed; they'll carry the fire starters. They should be pointing up towards the balloon when you put it in place.

, Bend the end of the wire over to secure. Do this for each side, using the full width of the bag. You should have a loose square shape.


Are the ends of your short wire pointing toward the balloon? If not, adjust them now.

, Most fire starters come in a big block. You may have to experiment a couple times to find what works as one package is far too much. Break off two medium-sized pieces and attach one to each end.


If they are too big, the bag will melt. If they are too small, the bag won't fly. A couple inches each (5 cm) in diameter is about right, for a lightweight 20 liter (5.3 US gal) bag.

, Adjust the bag as necessary to allow the bag to inflate completely. It will start to become buoyant and seem to want to fly. When you being to exert effort to keep it down, give it a gentle push and let it wander into the sky.


Be careful! If your fire starters are too big, the bag may melt. Stay alert.
For this method, it works best to do it in cold weather. The difference in temperature allows the heat to work more efficiently.

, Make sure you have something protective underneath, the razor will definitely go through the paper, and you'll want to protect your table or whatever it is that you're working on.

, Take your stencil and place it on the patch where you intend the design to be. Tape it down as close as you can to the edges. Also make a tape loop and attach it to the fabric wherever there is enough room on the underside of the stencil. The more secure it is, the better.

, Put some paint on your brush and begin painting over the stencil. Take your time and be careful around the edges.

, You may need to go over the stencil with more than one coat of paint.

",How to Blow Up a Balloon1," Something inexpensive, colorful, and heavy is easiest, but oblong or theme-shaped balloons may also be a nice touch, depending on what you're blowing up the balloons for.


A bag of latex balloons can be found in supermarket chains or party shops.;
, If you stretch out the rubbery latex of the balloon with your hands first, you'll notice that it becomes much easier to blow up the balloons by mouth afterwards. Stretching the balloon will loosen the latex, making the inflation process less resistant.









Stretch the balloon in all directions, being careful not to tear the latex. Just make sure not to stretch the balloon too much, or you risk it popping when you inflate it. A few stretches here and there will get the job done just fine.

, This will keep the balloon in position when inflating. Grasp the end of the balloon about a quarter of an inch below the lip of the opening. Your index finger should be on top and your thumb on bottom.








, Then use your lips to form a seal around the opening neck section of the balloon.








, This is the same action used when puffing your cheeks with air, but the air should pass into the balloon and your cheeks should be relaxed.









Try to keep your lips puckered and tight as you blow into the balloon. Your cheeks will fill with some air, but they shouldn't be getting really big — the balloon should!
Think of how a trumpeter blows into his or her horn: Maintain good embouchure, or facial muscle tension, especially if your lungs are weak or you're having trouble getting the balloon to fill with air.
Keep a tight seal between the lip of the balloon and your lips to maintain pressure.

, Then it will gradually expand after the initial resistance. You might be afraid that you or the balloon will go pop at this stage but don't worry, keep blowing and the resistance will soon pass and you will both be fine. This takes some getting used to, so keep trying until it happens, then use that experience to guide you for the next balloon.









If you're still having trouble blowing up the balloon after the first attempt, try tugging on the spout of the balloon gently as you blow into it for the second time.
If you are struggling, stretch the neck of the balloon, then seal the neck of the balloon with your thumb and index finger when breathing.

, If you need a breather in between blows, seal the balloon with your thumb and index finger. Then release your grip as you place the seal back into your mouth and blow in again.








, When you feel the balloon is resisting further expansion, the inflation process is complete. If the neck of the balloon inflates to a significant size, this means that you have overinflated the balloon and you'll need to let a little air out until the neck is flat again.








, When the balloon begins to strongly resist further expansion, it is time to tie the balloon. You've officially inflated your balloon. Now you can start inflating the next 49 balloons!

Find a pump specifically designed to inflate balloons.,
Attach the opening of the balloon to the nozzle of the pump.,
Pull out the hand lever on your pump and start pumping.",How to Blow Up a Balloon2," A simple hand pump designed for use with balloons is cheap and easy to transport. Look for ones that have containers near the hand pump where you can store extra balloons.

, The nozzle should be ribbed to allow for a tight hold on the opening of the balloon.








, No need to stretch out the balloon latex. Just pump until the balloon has as much air as intended. You're finished!

Finished.

",How to Make an Applique," If this is your first time making an applique, you may want to go with a simple design, like a heart, a star, or a bird - objects with clearly defined and recognizable silhouettes.


Do an online search for “applique designs” if you’d like to see a wide range of ideas that have worked for other crafters. If you find one you love, print it out so you can trace it later.
Keep in mind that you’ll be sewing around the edges of your applique when you apply it to your chosen article of clothing. Simpler geometric shapes will be easier to sew around than trees with many branches, or the skyline of a city. Go with what works for your skill level.
Think about what type of fabric fits both your design and the article you’ll be enhancing with your applique. Make a choice based on color and style. Fabrics made of light cotton or muslin work well.
If you’re feeling bold, choose a multi-layered design and more than one fabric. For example, you could create a black bird with red-tipped wings, or a white crescent moon with a yellow star.;
, You’ll be using your drawing as a pattern, so take a pencil and use clear, thick strokes that are easy to cut out. When your design is finished, carefully cut it out using a pair of scissors.









If your design includes letters or another asymmetrical shape that should be pointing in a certain direction, draw or trace its mirror image onto the paper. The shapes will be pointing in the correct direction on your finished piece.

, Make sure you trace on smooth side of the iron-on interfacing, since the side with glue is more difficult to work with. When you’re finished tracing your design, cut it out of the interfacing using a pair of scissors.









For this step, it’s important to use a fabric pen or a different pen with ink that won’t bleed to prevent getting spots and stains on your finished piece.
Iron-on interfacing is available at fabric stores. Try to find one with paper backing that can be peeled away - this will help when it comes time to attach your applique to your article of clothing.

, Turn the fabric over so that the right side is facing down. Place your iron-on interfacing cutouts glue side down on the fabric and carefully run an iron set on the “silk” setting over them until they are fused with the fabric.









Make sure the steam setting on your iron is off, since the moisture might affect the shape of your interfacing.

, Your applique is now ready to be attached to your piece.








, Make sure the underlying fabric is clean and pressed. If you’re working with cotton or another shrinkable fabric, run it through the washer and dryer in preparation for the applique.








, Do you want your applique to be centered, or offset? Try different arrangements to figure out what effect you like best.









If your iron-on interfacing has a removable paper backing, go ahead and remove the paper and stick your design where you want it to go on the fabric.
If your iron-on interfacing does not have adhesive backing, position your design and use a few straight pins to keep it in place.
Make sure your design and the underlying fabric are flat and free of wrinkles.

, Use a sewing machine to stitch around the perimeter of your design, gently guiding the fabric through the machine and pivoting when you come to a corner.









When you’ve stitched around the entire perimeter, stitch a few centimeters over the place where you started, then do a backstitch to finish it off. Turn the fabric over and clip the threads.
The settings on your sewing machine determine the length and width of your stitches. Use bigger or smaller stitches depending on what you want the finished piece to look like.
If you have more than one piece in your applique, stitch the bottom layer first, then position and stitch the second layer, and so on. Consider using contrasting threads for the different layers and fabrics.

, Trim loose threads from the back of the applique. Iron the shirt, bag, or blanket you just appliqued for the finishing touch.









Consider adding a few decorative touches, such as buttons, bows, or sequins.

, Then bring loop A back through the middle. This forms the basic bow shape, and a middle knot forms in the center.

, This tightens the bow and allows it to hold its shape. You may also need to pull on the tail ends of the bow. Adjust to be even both sides.

, Either cut the tails in a ""V' shape or diagonally. This looks neater and prevents the fabric from fraying.

, You can make as many as you need using the same method; the more you make, the easier this becomes.

Apply the mixed devorant paste with a brush across the designs you have drawn.,
Allow the devorant paste to dry completely, or use a hair drying to hurry the process along.,
Warm up your iron and set up your ironing board while the paste dries.,
Put a piece of scrap cloth between the t-shirt and the iron.,
Soak the fabric in warm, soapy water to remove the remaining devorant paste.",How to Make a Burnout Tee," If you cannot find one at a craft store, you can buy them from t-shirt suppliers or some logo stores. The active ingredient that creates the burnout dissolves linen, cotton and other plant fibers, making a design. The same ingredient does not strongly affect polyester, silk and wool, leaving a layer of the shirt intact. Possible choices include Silco and cotton/polyester blends.
, You can find devorant at traditional craft supply stores. It can also be ordered over the Internet. Fiber Etch and DuPont Devorant are common brands of devorant.

You can also mix your own devorant using sodium bisulfate, water, glycerine and printing paste. However, because you are working with acid (sodium bisulfate) it is not recommended that you do this the first time you make a burnout t-shirt.

, Wear rubber gloves before starting any work. Sodium bisulfate is corrosive and it can be a respiratory irritant., It should be 17 parts paste to 3 parts reactant. (85 percent paste to 15 percent reactant.)

Some devorant products come as gels and do not need to be mixed. Read the package instructions to confirm if you should mix the product.

, Pin a piece of synthetic fabric between the layers of the tee shirt. Pin the t-shirt to a frame or tape it down on a table. Using a fabric pen that will fade, draw a design on the shirt.,, Turn the tee over and apply the paste to the opposite side.

You can also apply the paste with silk screen techniques, from an applicator bottle, or with stamps.

, It will take longer to dry if you decide to burnout both sides of the tee., Set the iron to a cotton setting and turn off steam., Iron the sides of the t-shirt where the devorant was applied, 1 at a time, until the applied areas turn yellow., Rinse. You should make sure all devorant is washed out before wearing."

, Twist the fabric strip at the length desired, facing the fabric the right side up.

, Hold this twist between your thumb and index finger. Make another loop but this time, in the opposite direction (keep it the same size). Twist the loop toward you.

, The amount of loops you make depends on how full you want the loop to be and on how much fabric strip you've allowed for the project.

, Measure a length for the second tail (which holds the bow together and serves to attach it to the gift). Cut out a narrow strip of fabric or ribbon to this length. Wrap this around the center of the loops (where they all meet as twists). Tie both tail ends together at what is going to be the back of the bow.


Leave the narrow tails alone, as they will be used for attaching the bow and should not be shortened.

, Trim the ends of the fat tails diagonally to neaten.

, Use the narrow tails to tie or tape onto the gift.

Determine how high to hang your curtains.,
Take measurements on the wall.,
Map out where the curtain rod will hang.,
Make further measurements.",How to Install Curtains1," Compare the measurements of your curtains and curtain rods to the window itself. Most curtain rods can adjust size to fit a variety of windows. Measure the length of the curtains to determine how high you want to hang them. Hang the curtains with your hands to the window to see the best location. It will help to have a pal test the location of the curtains for you.


Some prefer curtains to cover the window's entirety, while others prefer the curtains to cover the top half of the window.;
, Measure 2 inches (5.08 cm) to 4 inches (10.16 cm) above your window or window molding, depending on how high you want to install your curtains. Use a straightedge to draw a horizontal pencil line at this height. Draw the line slightly higher if you want your window to appear a little taller than it actually is.Use a step ladder to help make an accurate measurement.
To help make an accurate line, use a yard stick. If you're still having trouble, use a friend to help you mark the measurements accurately.

, Extend the line about 2 inches (5.08 cm) to 4 inches (10.16 cm) past the window or window molding edges, depending on how far past the window you want your curtains to extend. If you want your curtains to make your window look a wider, draw the line a little further out than 4 inches (10.16 cm). Make sure your line extensions are equal on each side of the window.


The extended lines will mark, roughly, where the ends of the curtain rods will be.
Check the evenness of your line with a level. If the line isn't perfectly even, erase it and redraw.
It’s best to plan for a higher hang opposed to low hanging curtains., If you are planning to mount several curtains, you should follow this same process on each window. Your room will benefit from even curtains around the room. Copy the measurements from the initial window to all the other windows."

Knot the yarn onto a crochet hook.,
Pull the loop to the front of the work.,
Insert the hook into the work from the front.,
Pull a loop through to the front.,
Pull the second loop through the first.,
Slip stitch into the next stitch.,
Repeat this slip stitch as needed.,
Insert the hook from the back.,
Fasten off the yarn.",How to Embroider on Crochet1," Attach the yarn you want to use for your embroidery to a crochet hook using a standard slipknot.


The crochet hook should be approximately the same size hook used to make the crochet work you are embroidering into.
To make a slipknot:

Form a loop by crossing the loose end of the yarn under the attached end.
Grab the attached side and pull it up through the loop, creating a second loop in the process.
Tighten the first loop around the second.
Insert the hook into the second loop and tighten the second loop onto the hook.

;
, Carefully remove the slipknot from the hook. Place the loop behind the crochet piece, then insert the hook into the nearest gap and grab onto the loop. Pull the loop of the slipknot through the front of the work.


The knot itself must stay at the back of the project.
The point at which you work here should be the same point at which you want the embroidery to start.

, With the slipknot loop still on your hook, insert the hook through the gap lying after the adjacent stitch.


This can be the next stitch to the right, left, top, or bottom. It could even be a stitch situated diagonally from your current space. The ""next"" stitch is simply the nearest stitch you need to complete your embroidery design.
This step starts one surface slip stitch.

, At the back of the work, wrap the yarn around the hook in a counterclockwise motion. Pull this loop of yarn back through to the front of the project.


This step continues the slip stitch process but does not end it.

, Pull the new loop you just created through the original slipknot loop, letting the slipknot loop drop off the hook in the process.


The new loop should now be the only loop on your hook.
This step completes one surface slip stitch.
Consider holding the knot or base of the slipknot in place at the back of the piece as you create this first slip stitch. Doing so can help keep the stitch straight, neat, and tight.

, Create a second slip stitch using the same technique used to work the first.


Insert the hook into the gap after the next stitch in the pattern, keeping the loop on the hook as you work.
Yarn over the hook from the back of the work, wrapping counterclockwise.
Pull this yarn-over back through the to the front of the work and through the loop on your hook. The previous loop should drop off and a new loop should be left on your hook.

, Continue making slip stitches in the same manner until you complete your desired embroidery pattern.

, After making the last stitch of your design, carefully remove the hook from the working loop. Re-insert the hook from the back of the work, picking up the working loop in the process and drawing it to the back.


Make sure that the working loop stays open when you remove the hook.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Pull this tail through the working loop on your hook, dropping the loop in the process and securing the yarn.


Weave the excess tail into the back of the work, hiding it behind the surface slip stitch embroidery at the front. Doing so makes the embroidery more secure and hides the excess yarn.

Anchor your thread to your fabric by inserting the needle through the bottom of the fabric and pulling it taut.

,
Start on a curved edge of the applique shape, instead of at the edges.

,
Use a slip stitch to turn the fabric under.,
Hold your needle parallel to the fabric so you keep your stitches small.,
Return your stitch backwards along the line of the freezer paper a few millimeters.,
Repeat as you go around your applique.,
Knot the thread when you finish and reach the point at which you started.",How to Hand Applique," You can trace a pattern from a book or purchase a plastic shape from a craft store. Try a simple, curved shape for your first hand-turned applique.;
, Lay the shiny side face down on the shape and draw onto it with pencil. Cut the shape out of the freezer paper with paper scissors.

, Smooth your piece of applique fabric onto the top of the ironing board, with the front of the fabric facing up. Set the freezer paper template on the fabric with the shiny side down.


Iron the freezer paper onto the fabric. The shiny side will lightly adhere to the fabric so that you can cut the fabric out to shape., This is the fabric you will turn under while you sew the applique onto the main piece of fabric.


Use cotton fabric for your first applique. It is thin and easy to hand-turn.

, Later on, if you use applique patterns with several pieces, you will want to adhere them with freezer paper, outline them and cut them all at once to ensure your fabric pattern matches up., cotton thread for stitching your applique. Ensure the thread matches the fabric on your applique piece. It does not need to match the fabric underneath.

, The best time to applique is when your fabric is still a single layer, before you construct a garment. It will ensure your stitches are hidden in the final product.

, Choose the position for your applique motif. Pin through the applique and the freezer paper with applique pins.


Use applique pins every half-inch to inch (1.3 to 2.5cm) to ensure it stays still while you sew.
Your freezer paper will serve as a guide while you sew. You will want to turn the fabric under until the fabric is flush with the side of the freezer paper.

, Use twice as much thread as the area you want to sew. Loop the end several times at the bottom and double or triple knot it.

, Most people hand applique when they are sitting in a chair. You can easily lay your fabric on your lap and turn it with your hands as you make progress.


Use a thimble to reduce the wear on your hands.

,,, Place your stitches one-eighth inch (3mm) apart.A slip-stitch is also called a blind stitch because it is hidden in the between two folds of fabric.

, Insert it one-eighth inch into the fabric. Pick up just a few threads with your needle as you make a forward stitch and pull the thread through.


When doing hand applique, you aim to insert the needle at the edge of where your freezer paper is, so that the outside fabric is turned in as you stitch.

, Use a toothpick or stiletto for turning edges to help turn the fabric outside of the paper under the paper outline., Take your time so that you ensure your allowance is neatly turned under your shape. Make your stitches as close as possible around corners.

, Knot the end of the thread and clip it. Pull off your freezer paper.

Test the walls.,
Punch a starter hole.,
Install an anchor.,
Mount the brackets.,
Attach the rod brackets.",How to Install Curtains2," Knock on the ends of each line you drew. If the wall sounds solid, you're still on the wood that frames the window, and you can install the rods with screws only. If the wall sounds hollow, you should first install anchors.


You could also use a stud finder to determine if the walls are strong enough to install the rod without anchors. Stud finders can be found at any hardware store.

, Once you are satisfied with the line's placement on the wall, you should mark it. At the end of each line use an awl to punch a starter hole. Awls are common woodworking tools used to mark the beginning of a hole. Don't make the hole too large. It is best to make a smaller hole to help you align the screws later in the process.

, To ensure a secure hold of the curtains use traditional toggle bolts.Screw the metal wall anchor into each hole, if necessary, with a power drill and a phillips head drill bit. It should be an easy installation and only require you to fully thread the anchor into the wall. Skip this step if you're installing directly into the wood.


If your wall sounded hollow and you don't use an anchor, you could damage your walls. Your curtains could fall out of the wall and potentially injure someone.

, Hold a bracket against one of holes you punched. If you installed screw anchors, hold the bracket over one of the anchors you installed. Your brackets probably have two screw holes. Place the bracket's top screw hole over the hole or anchor.


Hold up the bracket. Tape the bracket firmly against the wall with a couple of strips of masking tape. Repeat the process for the other bracket. This will help you attach the brackets to your walls. You can skip this step if you have a friend to help you hold the brackets., Screw the brackets to the wall with their attached hardware. Remove the tape once the rods are firmly attached to the wall. Many find that it is beneficial to attach the curtains to the rod before mounting them to the brackets.


It might be easiest to test the hold of the brackets before thinking about the curtains. Test the hold of the brackets by mounting the rod into the bracket's slot.

"
"
Thread the rod through the curtains.,
Secure the rod to the brackets.,
Finalize the installation.",How to Install Curtains3," Attach your curtains to the rod before hanging the rod from its brackets. This will make things easier for you. Clip the straight tops of tab-less and pocket-less curtains with curtain clips. Start at the outer edge of each panel and space each clip evenly.


Thread the rod through the top pocket opening of the rod pocket curtain panels. Pull each tab loop of both curtains over the rod.

, For most bracket and rods systems, you'll either thread each end of the rod through the bracket holes or place the rod on top of a crescent-shaped depression in the brackets., Press the two finials into each end of the rod, or screw them in place, depending on their construction. Once the curtains are hanging from the rods in the desired spot, test the curtains. Make sure you can move the curtains as they’re designed to move.

Thread the yarn needle.,
Knot the other end of the yarn.,
Bring the yarn up from the back.,
Stitch down in another location.,
Draw the yarn back up.,
Repeat as needed.,
Consider making a second line of running stitch.,
Knot the end.",How to Embroider on Crochet2," Weave one end of the yarn through the eye of a large yarn needle. Do not knot the yarn onto the needle.


Instead of knotting the yarn in place, you should pull a tail approximately 4 inches (10 cm) through the eye. Press this tail against the eye of the needle as you work to hold the yarn steady and in place.
If the yarn starts working its way out of the needle as you embroider, simply pull it back through and continue working.

, Cut a length of yarn long enough for your project. Tie a large knot at the newly cut, unattached end of the yarn.


The yarn should be a little longer than the total length of the finished embroidery design.
You do not need to use a slipknot. A standard overhand knot will work just fine.
Make sure that the knot you tie is larger than the gaps in between your crochet stitches. A large knot will help prevent the embroidery from unraveling.

, Poke the needle through the first space at the start of your pattern, drawing it from the back to the front of the project.


Pull the needle all the way through until the knot lies flat against the back of the project.

, Pass the needle over one full stitch in your crochet piece, then insert it into the gap lying at the opposite side of that stitch.


Draw the needle all the way through to the back of the fabric. Keep pulling it down until the yarn of your embroidery stitch lies flat against the material.
If desired, you could make the stitch length longer by passing the needle over more than one stitch before inserting it back into the fabric.
This completes one running stitch.

, Pass the yarn over another full stitch from the back, then poke into the gap on the other side of that stitch. Pull the needle up through to the front, bringing the yarn with it.


Doing this starts another stitch.
Make sure that the yarn at the back of the fabric is flat against the material when you stop pulling your needle.
If desired, you can alter the space between stitches by skipping over more than one stitch.

, Continue this same pattern until you reach the end of your design.


Pass over one full stitch from the front, then insert the needle down into the fabric.
Pass over one full stitch from the back, then insert the needle up into the fabric.

, Left alone, the running stitch will create a dashed line, giving the embroidery a ""sewn"" look. If you want to create a more continuous line, however, pass over your first line with a second one.


Essentially, you're working your way backwards and reversing your embroidery stitches. When you reach a stitch that shows through the top of the fabric, make a stitch that shows at the bottom. For each stitch that shows at the bottom of the material, make a stitch that shows at the top.

, When you reach the end of your embroidery design, insert the needle into the fabric from the front and draw it all the way through to the back. Tie a large knot to complete the embroidery.


Again, a standard overhand knot will suffice here. Just make sure that the knot is too large to fit though the gaps in the material.
You can trim any excess yarn or weave it into the back of the material. Just make sure that it is no longer visible from the front.

"
"
Thread and knot the yarn.,
Bring the needle up from the back.,
Pinch the yarn and straighten the needle.,
Wrap the yarn around the needle.,
Insert the tip of the needle back into the fabric.,
Tighten the coil.,
Push your needle all the way through.,
Knot the yarn from the back.",How to Embroider on Crochet3," Cut a length of yarn approximately 10 inches (25.4 cm) long. Knot one end, then weave the other end through the eye of a large yarn needle.


Pull about 4 inches (10 cm) of yarn through the eye of the needle to help prevent the yarn from slipping back out as you work.
A standard overhand knot should work for this step. Do not use a slipknot.
The knot must be larger than the gaps in your crochet work to prevent it from popping out as you embroider.

, Poke the needle into the back of the material at the point where you want the French knot. Pull the needle and the yarn completely through to the front.


Ideally, you should position the needle in between to stitches/strands in your original crochet piece.
Continue pulling the yarn through until the overhand knot at the end of your strand lies flat against the back of the work

, With the index finger and thumb of your non-dominant hand, pinch the yarn 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10 cm) above the surface of the material.


Lay the side of the needle against the yarn, positioning it in between your pinched fingers and the surface of the material.

, Using your non-dominant hand, wrap the yarn around the needle two to four times.


Continue pinching the yarn as you do this. You'll need to maintain a good amount of tension to prevent the yarn from unwinding.
The number of times you wind the knot will alter the thickness of the French knot. The more you wind the yarn, the larger the French knot will be.

, Choose a point directly next to the exit point, but do not use the same exact spot. An adjacent stitch gap should be fine.


Do not push the needle all the way through the material yet.
Do not use the same exact hole. If you do, the knot will likely pop out through the back of the fabric when you finish.

, Use your non-dominant hand to gently tug the yarn downward, causing the coils to tighten.


Continue tugging until the coils wind themselves into a tight bunch, snug against the top of the crochet material.

, Finish pushing the yarn needle through the fabric.


The needle and the tail hanging off it should run through the center of the bundled coils, tightening them into a decorative knot.

, Tie another large overhand knot at the back of the material to secure the French knot from the other side.


Trim the rest of the tail, if desired, or weave the tail through the back side of the crochet work to hide it.

Let it go, and watch it fly.",How to Reuse Balloons," What better way to put it to use? There are many popular games you can play using a balloon. Some of them you may even know of already. Balloon games include:


""Keep it up"": When the balloon is beginning to deflate and it begins to fall instead of float, play ""keep it up"" with a couple of friends, and ""keep it up""! That's right; hit it up in the air, and don't let it hit the ground. Make sure to do it when it is soggy, but not completely deflated.
""Balloon Soccer"": Play soccer with your balloon, just make sure not to step on it!
""Volleyballoon"": Play volleyball the way you normally would, but with a balloon. This is a great activity for a rainy day of some sort. If you don't have a net, improvise, make a line, and set a goal between two chairs to hit it into.;
, To do this, mix eight cups of flour, two cups of water and one cup of glue, and dip old newspaper strips into it. Lay the gooey paper strips onto the balloon, laying bout three or four layers, and allow it to air dry. Then, when it is dry, paint it different colors and take a swing at it.


A piñata can be kept for a long time until the next party occasion – just add the candies at the time it is going to be used.

,


This works especially well when you have many colored balloons, so you don't just have one colored confetti.

, Hang the used balloons up and purchase some (safe) darts, and then take aim. Make prizes and give them to those who win. Check out How to create your own balloon dart carnival game for more information.

, Smiles, frowns, and blank expressions all around! Put them on the body of a scarecrow, create a birth certificate, etc. This may not sound like fun until you really get into it. You can even name your balloon and make it a ""pet"" or a ""friend"". The possibilities of these blank faces are endless.

, Carefully undo the knot and let the air out. Then follow How to create a stress ball for the instructions on making one from a balloon. Stress balls provide a little light stress relief and it's also therapeutic making them.

, Here the limit is your imagination but as you can see from the image, a lot of incredible things are possible for the artist using balloons as their material.


Read How to get started in balloon modeling for more ideas.

, Make up a pretend story of what will happen to it. Watch it go higher and higher, the balloon you always loved. Only do this with a latex balloons though, as this kind will shatter at the extreme cold temperatures it hits as it floats above and not cause problems for wildlife. Don't use Mylar balloons this way or bunches of balloons.

",How to Make a Balloon Giraffe," Leave about two to three inches/5-7.5cm un-inflated at the end before you tie-off. A hand pump works best for this - not only is it more sanitary, but it is also difficult to inflate long balloons by mouth.;
, Starting at the knot, take a section about three inches/7.5cm from the top and twist two to three times. Hold the section to keep it from unraveling.

, Twist off 2 two-inch sections. Keep holding all of the sections.

, Fold between the ears so the nose and first ear section are along the length of the balloon. The ends of the ears should line up. While holding the nose and body in one hand, twist the ears with the other hand. Now you should have a nose, ears, and a long body.

, The length of the neck should be about nine inches/23cm - long enough to make it clear that this is a giraffe! Twist off the neck section and hold it (like in Step 2).

, These are usually about 3-4 inches/7.5-10cm. Continue to hold all of the sections.

, Using the same method as you did in Step 4, fold between the leg sections and twist them together.

, Take enough balloon to create the body (but keep in mind that you'll need 6-8 inches/15-20cm for the hind legs!) and twist off the section.

, Twist off 2 three-four inch sections for the legs. Fold and twist using the method from Step 4; the remaining balloon becomes the tail. Done! You have a giraffe!

Make a basic twist.,
Make a lock twist.,
Make a fold twist.",How to Make Balloon Animals1," Inflate a balloon and tie it off at the end. Grasp it near the tie in your non-dominant hand. Use your dominant hand to twist the balloon a few times so that you create a separate balloon segment. In order to keep the balloon from untwisting, hold the two segments with one hand.









Use #260 balloons, which are long balloons designed for the purpose of being made into balloon animals. These are available at party stores and costume stores. Water balloons and party balloons can't be twisted into animal shapes.
You can inflate the balloons using your lungs, but it's far easier to use a small hand pump. These are available at toy stores and party stores that sell balloon supplies.
You should be able to grasp the balloon firmly without it popping. Keep your fingernails and jewelry away from the surface of the balloon so they don't catch on the rubber and pop it. If the balloon seems to pop at the slightest touch, try using a higher-quality brand. Less expensive balloon brands use less rubber in their balloons, and the thinner surface area is much easier to pop.;
, Inflate a balloon, tie it off and make two basic twists close together, so that the balloon has a total of four segments. Hold all four segments in the same hand to keep them from coming untwisted. Use your other hand to grasp the two middle segments and gently hold them apart from the two end segments. Twist the two middle segments together three times, then hold up the balloon. The segments are now locked in place.









The lock twist is used to hold the balloon sculpture together, since without it the balloon comes untwisted.
The lock twist is also used to make small balloon animal ears and other animal features.

, Inflate a balloon, tie it off and make one basic twist near the end. Holding the twist in place with one hand, use your other hand to fold the top of the balloon down. Grasp the twist and the top of the balloon and twist them together three times so that you form a loop. The balloon now has three segments: two end segments and one loop segment.









The fold twist functions like a lock twist, in that it prevents the balloon from becoming untwisted.
The fold twist is often used to create ears, noses, and other animal features.

Tape the straw to the top of your car.,
Use the car.",How to Make a Balloon Car1," Use a pen and ruler to draw the rectangle first. Cut the rectangle out with a pair of scissors or a craft blade.








You can also use foam core. It is the same thing you use for presentation boards.
For a fancy car, paint the cardboard with acrylic paint or cover it with duct tape. Let the paint dry before moving on.;
, Do not include the bendy part of the straw. Use only the smooth, straight part. These will hold the wheels and axles in place.








, Lay the straws across the cardboard widthwise, ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) from each narrow end. Make sure that the straws are straight and parallel to the ends of the cardboard. If they are crooked, your car won't go straight.Secure the straws to the cardboard with tape.









Use sturdy tape, such as duct tape. This way, the straws won't wiggle loose.
Make sure that the tape covers the entire length of each straw.

, Cut the pointy ends off of the wooden skewer first. Next, cut the wooden skewer down to 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). You will need two such pieces. These will make the axles for your car's wheels.









If scissors aren't tough enough for the job, try wire cutters.
If you can't find any wooden skewers, use lollipop sticks instead. Make sure that they roll around easily in the straws.

, You should have about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out of each end. The wheels will go onto the skewers next. This will allow the axles to rotate freely inside the straws and allow your car to move.








, Use bottle caps or large coins to trace four circles onto a sheet of cardboard. Cut the circles out using a pair of scissors or a craft blade. Make the circles as even as you can.You can also use bottle caps instead of cardboard.

, Poke a hole in the center of each wheel. Slide the wheels onto the ends of the skewers. Make sure that they don't touch the cardboard, or they may get stuck. If the wheels are loose, place a drop of glue or clay on the end of the skewers. Don't worry, this won't stop the wheels from turning.









If you used cardboard of foam core, you should be able to make the holes using a pen, pencil, or a skewer.
If you used bottle caps, you will need to punch the hole using a nail and hammer. Ask an adult to help you.

, Slide a straw into a balloon by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters). Wrap some tape in a tight spiral around the end of the balloon. Extend the tape over the edge so that it covers part of the straw. Make sure that there are no gaps. You want an airtight seal.








Use regular balloon, not a water balloon, noodle, heart, alien, worm, etc.

, Turn the car so that it is standing on its wheels. Place the straw and balloon on top, each facing a narrow end. Make sure that the straw is straight. The balloon should be resting on top of the cardboard and the straw hanging over one of the ends. Tape the straw securely to the cardboard.









It's okay if the straw is hanging over the edge of the car. If it is touching the ground, trim it down.
Don't let the balloon hang over the edge. If you do, it will bump against the ground and stop your car from moving., Blow some air into the balloon through the straw. Pinch the straw shut so that the air doesn't escape. Place the car on a smooth, flat surface. Let go of the straw and watch the car go!








The straw is the back of the car. The balloon is the front.
If the balloon is not holding air, there may be a gap. Wrap some more tape around the end of the balloon.If the balloon still is not holding any air, it might have a hole in it. Get a new balloon."

Twist the back legs together.",How to Make Balloon Animals2," Just keep blowing until the air has inflated the balloon to about three inches from the end, then stop blowing and tie off the balloon.








, Starting at the knotted end of the balloon, make three basic twists to create a total of four balloon segments. The first segment, which includes the balloon's knot, will form the dog's snout. It is slightly longer than the second two segments, which will form the dog's ears. The last segment, which will be twisted into the dog's body, is the longest.









Hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted, since they have not yet been locked.
Experiment with different segment lengths for the snout and ear segments. You can also make an extra-long snout and call your balloon animal an anteater.

, Use your free hand to grasp the second and third segments, the ear segments, and twist them together three times. This lock twist will keep them from coming untwisted. Do you see the dog's head?








, Make the first twist a few inches below the head to form a neck segment. Make two more twists below the neck to create two segments that are equal in length; these will be the front legs. Hold all the new segments in the same hand to prevent them from coming untwisted.









Would you rather have a giraffe than a dog? Make the neck segment extra long; the rest of the body is exactly the same.
You can make the leg segments long or short, but they should be the same length.

, Fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments. Grasp the leg segments with your free hand and twist them together three times at the base of the neck. The legs and neck are now locked in place.








, This time divide the remaining length of the balloon into four equal segments. The first segment is the dog's body, the second two segments will become the back legs of the dog, and the final segment is the tail. Hold them all in one hand to prevent them from becoming untwisted.








, Fold the balloon at the twist between the two back leg segments. Grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the body segment. Take a look at your finished sculpture: it has a knotted nose, short ears, front legs and back legs and a tail that sticks straight up. Your work is complete.

, Twist the balloon a few inches from the knot to create a small segment that will be the monkey's face. Hold both segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting.








, Start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a small segment in between the twists. Fold the segment so that the two twists line up. Use your free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place. You've just made the monkey's first ear.








, A couple of inches from the first ear, make another basic twist to create a short segment. Hold it in one hand so that it doesn't untwist. This new short segment will be the monkey's forehead.








, Start by making a second basic twist close to the first one so that you have a new small segment between the twists. Fold this segment so that the two twists line up. Use you free hand to grasp the folded segment and twist it three times to lock it in place. This is the monkey's second ear.








, Carefully grasp the two ears by the twists at their bases. The forehead segment will be sticking out between them. Twist the ears together three times to lock them in place. The monkey's head is now complete: it has a nose, a forehead, and two ears.








, Make the first twist a few inches below the head to form the neck segment. Make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length. These will become the monkey's arms. Hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting.








, Fold the balloon at the twist between the two arm segments. Grasp the segments and twist them three times at the base of the neck segment to lock the arms and neck in place. The balloon should now resemble a monkey with a head, neck and arms.








, Make the first twist a few inches below the arms to form the body segment. Make two more twists lower down to form two segments that are equal in length. These will become the monkey's legs. Hold all of the segments in one hand to prevent them from untwisting.









Leave plenty of room at the end of the balloon for the tail, which should be the longest segment of all.

, Fold the balloon at the twist between the two leg segments. Grasp the segments and twist them together three times at the base of the body. The body and legs are now locked in place, and the tail is hanging down from the body.








, Choose a balloon in a contrasting color and inflate it completely, then tie it off. There's no need to leave a tail at the end. Slide it between the monkey's arms and legs so that the monkey appears to be climbing it.

Tuck one loop into the other.,
Make the head.",How to Make Balloon Animals4," White or black balloons both make striking swan sculptures.








, Create a paperclip shape with the balloon; the knotted end should be at the center of the paperclip, and the tail end should jut out from the end of the paperclip. Another way to approach this shape is to create a circle with overlapping ends, then flatten it.








, Grasp the folded balloon in the middle so that you're holding three parts: the top of the paperclip, the bottom of the paperclip and the knot in the center. Twist the three parts together, making sure you catch the knot in the twist. Hold the twist to make sure it doesn't come undone. You now have two loops with a long neck jutting out from the center twist.








, Use your free hand to close one of the loops and push it up through the other one. This creates the body of the swan, with the tucked-in loop resembling folded wings and the outer loop resembling the swan's underside. Tucking in the loop also keeps the structure from coming undone.








, Grasp the neck a few inches from the tail and use your hand to move some of the air into the uninflated tail part. This will cause the top of the neck to curve into the shape of the head. The remaining uninflated tail forms the swan's beak.

, Your juice box will have a front, back, and two side panels. Cut the straws so that they are the same width as the front of back panels.









Make sure that you are cutting the smooth part of the straw. Do not include the bendy part.

, Set the box down so that the front is facing you. Lay the straws down on top, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the top and bottom edges. Secure the straws to the box with a strip of tape. These will hold the axles and wheels in place.









Make sure that the straws are straight. If they are crooked, your car won't go straight.
Use strong tape, such as duct tape.

, Cut the pointy ends off of the skewers first. Next, cut the skewers down so that they are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box and straws.









If you don't have any skewers, you can use lollipop sticks instead. Make sure that they can slide into the straws easily.

, You should have about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out of each end. You will be mounting the wheels onto the ends of these next.








, Fill four bottle caps with clay or pieces of sponge. Press them onto the skewers. Do not let the clay part touch the straws.You can also secure them with hot glue instead.









If you don't have any bottle caps, you can use buttons instead. You can also cut circles out of cardboard. Make sure that they are all the same size.

, Slide a straw about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) into a balloon. Wrap a piece of tape over the mouth of the balloon. Extend the tape over the end of the balloon and onto the straw. Make sure that there are no gaps.








, Center the balloon and straw on top of the juice box. Part of the balloon will be hanging over the end of the juice box. Part of the straw will be sticking out over the other end. Make sure that the straw is straight, then place a piece of tape over the straw to hold it in place.









Use sturdy tape, such as duct tape.
If the straw is too long, cut it down. You want only about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) sticking out over the edge of the box.

The best size is a small water bottle.
Make sure it's thoroughly rinsed it out and clean, especially if you’re using a soda or juice bottle.

, Measure across the bottom of your bottle. Cut two pieces of straw down to that measurement. Use only the smooth part of the straw, not the bendy. These will hold the axels and wheels.







, Tape the first straw about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the bottle. Tape the other straw about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) below the domed part. Make sure that the straws are straight and parallel to each other. If they are crooked, your car won't go straight.








If your bottle has ribs, use those as a guide.
Use strong, sturdy tape, such as duct tape.

, Next, cut them down so that they are 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your bottle. They need to be long enough so that they can slide into the straws and hold the wheels.








, You should have about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out of each end of each straw. You will be sliding the wheels onto the skewers next.








, Get four bottle caps. Draw an X on top of each one to find the center. Use a nail and hammer to punch a hole into the middle of each X.









You can also trace four circles onto a sheet of cardboard, then cut them out.
You can also use buttons instead of bottle caps. Don't poke holes in them and make sure that they are the same size.If you're scared to use a nail and hammer, stuff a small piece of sponge into each bottle cap., Slide the wheels over the ends of the skewers. Make sure that the inside of the bottle cap is facing out. Don't press the wheels too close to the bottle, or they will get stuck. If the wheels are too loose, secure them with a drop of glue or clay.








If you are using buttons, simply hot glue them to the end of each skewer.If you stuffed the inside of the bottle caps with sponge, simply slide them onto the skewers., Set the ""car"" down so that it is sitting on top of its wheels. Find a spot on top of the car just below the bottle's dome. Use a craft blade to poke two slits in an X-shape. This will allow you to attach your car's ""engine.""







, Tuck a straw about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) into a balloon. Wrap a piece of tape around the end of the balloon in a tight spiral. Make sure that the tape goes over the mouth of the balloon and onto the straw. Also, make sure that there are no gaps. You want an airtight seal.









Insert the straw bendy-side-first into the balloon.

, Slide the other end of the straw into the X you just made. Keep pushing the straw through the hole until it comes out of the bottle's mouth. You want about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of straw sticking out of the bottle's mouth.If it is too long, cut it down.









The straw should bend naturally at its bendy part inside the bottle.

, Blow some air into the balloon through the straw. Pinch the straw so that the air doesn't come out. Place the car down on a flat, smooth surface. Let go of the straw. Watch the car go, go, go!

Cut circular holes inside two pieces of cardstock.,
Blow up five balloons to create flower petals.,
Blow up two smaller balloons to create the flower's center.",How to Create Decorative Balloon Flowers1," You will need to make one circular hole that has a diameter of approximately 6” (15cm) and another that has a diameter that is about 4” (10cm) across. Don't worry -- these circles don't have to be cut professionally and the piece of cardstock doesn't have to look nice. You'll only be using the cardstock and holes as a template, not for the final product.






;
, You may want to select balloons that are the same color to help them look like the petals of the same flower. After you blow up each balloon, hold it at the end to make sure that its center fits through the 6” (15cm) cardboard stock template. If it's too big or too small, inflate or deflate it accordingly. Tie the end of each balloon when you're done.








, The balloons should be a different color from the petals so that they stand out when you put the flower together. After you blow up each balloon, hold it at the end to make sure that its center fits through the 4” (10cm) cardboard stock template. If it's too big or too small, inflate or deflate it accordingly.

,Display and enjoy your homemade ornaments

",How to Make a String Ornament," This has the potential to become messy if you're not careful.;
,


Inflate the balloon(s) to your desired size. Anything from 2-6 inches (5-15cm) can work well. Bear in mind that larger sizes will require more string.
Pour white glue into a small shallow bowl. Thin the glue slightly with water. You will need to dampen the string with the diluted glue before using it on the balloon.
Cut the string into 3 or 4 ft (91cm - 121cm) sections to make it easier to use and less likely to tangle.

, You can use a bolt or some hex nuts to hold the string under the surface of the glue to get it thoroughly wet.









Run the dampened string between your pinched fingers to remove excess glue. Your object here is to dampen the string, but not have it dripping with glue.

, There is no ""right"" way to do this––just wrap. Continue to wrap the string around the balloon in a latticework, leaving no more than a finger width between strings.








,,, There should be no gaps in the latticework that are larger than the tip of your index finger.









Check to be certain there are no loose ends, and that all strings are stuck to each other somehow.

, Glitter, for example, can go well on these ball ornaments.

",How to Make Wax Balloon Luminaries," Because you will be working with hot wax and will need to move quickly, it’s better to have all your supplies and stations ready to go before you work.

Lay wax paper down on a clean, flat surface. Your waxed balloon will sit on top of the paper while it cools.



 


Place wax pieces in either the double boiler or a large glass bowl.






Have heavy rubber gloves nearby and ready to wear.





;
, For this craft the water-filled balloon will provide the right shape and protection to hold the hot wax.


Don’t overfill balloon. You simply want it to create a vase shape so consider filling the balloon approximately 2/3 of the way with water and then tie the top.

, Depending on how you want to cook the wax, either turn the stove to medium-low with wax in double boiler or place bowl in microwave and cook on high for approximately 30 seconds.


Constantly stir wax as it melts. You want it to melt smoothly but not over melt and then burn.
Watch the double boiler constantly and remove from heat when 90% of the wax has melted. Stir and the remaining wax will melt.
Microwave the glass bowl in 30-second increments and stir in between heat times. As with the double boiler method, stir and heat until 90% of the wax has melted. Then place on a counter and continue stirring until all wax has melted.

, Before you do anything, glove up for protection. Hot wax will leave burns on the skin so it’s better to be safe than sorry.

Dip the balloon several times into the wax. In order to obtain that thick wax appearance you will need to dip, remove and repeat until you achieve the desired thickness.






Work slowly so that the wax adheres to the balloon and builds the coat.







, The wax covering the balloon should still be soft, but not runny. Balloon should be placed with the topside downward (so the bottom of the wax area should be facing upward)., The ideal drying environment is cool and dry, allowing for 24 to 48 hours of dry time depending on how thick you made your vase.,,,"

Wash the fabric beforehand.,
Brew coffee.,
Fill a pot with water.,
Pour brewed coffee into the pot.,
Bring the mixture to a boil.,
Add the fabric to the pot.,
Steep the fabric.,
Remove and rinse the fabric.,
Rinse the pot.,
Wash and dry the fabric gently.",How to Dye Fabric With Coffee1," Before dyeing, wash and dry the fabric as you normally would. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the dye from penetrating evenly.


Newly purchased fabrics may be coated with a finishing spray, so it is especially important to follow through with this step. The finishing sprays used to coat textiles are often chemicals that are often skin-irritants and they could interfere with how the textile fibers absorb the dye.;
, The amount of coffee that you should brew will depend on how dark you would like the fabric to be. Stronger coffee will achieve a darker tint.


If you are looking to create a darker tint with the coffee, use more coffee or use a dark/very strong roast. If you would like a lighter tint, use less coffee or use coffee that is a light or medium roast.
As an alternative to preparing several batches of coffee at home, you can use instant coffee or you can purchase brewed coffee from a local store or coffee shop.This could be significantly more expensive, however.

, Place the pot on the stove and turn the burner to high.


The size of the pot will depend on how much fabric you are dyeing. As a rule of thumb, you will need a large enough pot to completely submerge the fabric in water.

, When the coffee is finished brewing, pour the coffee into the pot with the water.

, After pouring all of your prepared coffee into the pot, bring the coffee/water to a boil. Turn off the heat as soon as the coffee reaches a full boil.

, Once you have turned the heat off and the coffee has stopped bubbling, submerge the fabric entirely into the coffee. Stir it around a bit to make sure any air pockets are eliminated.


Since the water just stopped boiling, it may be best to use a wooden spoon, so as not to burn yourself or ruin your utensils.

, The longer your fabric steeps in the coffee, the deeper it will be dyed. You will need to wait about an hour for appreciable, colorfast results, but you can allow a longer steeping time for a deeper tint., Remove the fabric from the coffee dye and rinse it thoroughly under cold water. Do this until the water runs clear, which will indicate that all of the excess dye has been removed.


After rinsing the excess coffee dye, you will be able to accurately tell how dark the fabric has been tinted. If you still want the fabric to be darker after rinsing it, you can steep the fabric again.
Once you have achieved the desire tint, prepare a large enough container to hold all of your fabric with cold water and let the fabric soak. You can add vinegar to this cold water bath and let soak for ten minutes to set the dye., When you are finished dyeing the fabric, rinse the pot. The coffee dye may stain the pot if you do not drain and wash it promptly after the dyeing process is complete.

, Use a delicate cycle in the washing machine with cold water and use a mild detergent. You can then dry the fabric on low in the dryer or hang it up in the shade to dry.The coffee dye described above will not provide a completely colorfast finish since it is a natural dye, which means that the color will fade a bit with each successive wash.

Repeat the process to make more rows.",How to Make a Balloon Arch1," Use wire cutters to cut a long piece of sturdy wire to the length and height you want the arch to be. You can also purchase a balloon arch kit from the store, and use the wire frame from there.


Because wire gets flimsier the longer you cut it, this method is best used for smaller arches.;
, Stick the ends of the arch into a bucket filled with gravel, pebbles, or sand. If you bought a pre-made arch from the store, it may already have a flat, base or platform. In this case, place something heavy, such as a brick or cinderblock on the base to weigh it down.


Add a thin layer of colored sand or pebbles to your bucket. This will hide the plain sand or pebbles.
Wrap bricks or cinderblocks in paper that matches your balloons. You can also paint them to match the base of your balloon arch.

, They can all be the same color, or they can be different ones. Tie the tail end of each balloon into a knot as soon as you finish blowing it up. Try to make each balloon the same size.Use a regular pump for this method, not a helium tank.
You don't have to use a balloon pump for this, but your lungs may get tired after a while.

, If you are having trouble with this, you can tie the balloons together using string instead. Repeat this step for the remaining two balloons. You should now have two balloon pairs., Place your first set of balloons over the second one in a cross shape. Pull the bottom two balloons upward. Pull the left one to the right, and the right one to the left. You will have something that looks like a four-leaf clover.Alternatively, you can tie the balloons together in a cross shape with some string.

, Pull the balloon clover against the wire. Make sure that the wire is resting against the knot in the middle of the clover. Twist the two adjacent balloons together so that they close in front of the wire.You can also secure the balloons to the wire with string or colorful ribbon.

, Blow four balloons at a time. Twist them into sets, then twist the sets together to make a clover. Slide the clover onto the wire, just above the bottom row of balloons, and secure it. Keep doing this until the wire is filled.You can use all the same color or you can alternate colors.

You can use a small piece of craft wire to bind the ends of the two balloons together by wrapping the wire around them a few times. Just be careful -- the wire can pop your balloons. If you're concerned about this, you can use ordinary string instead, but it will be a bit weaker.








, The balloons should be evenly spaced when you tie their ends together, creating a ""Y"" shape. Use the same material you previously used to bind the ends of the remaining three balloons together. Just hold the three ends together with one hand and use your other hand to wrap the wire around the ends.








, Tie the set of two flower petals to the of three petals by tying all of the ends together. The balloons should extend outward, so that all of the ends are tied together in the center. The balloons may not feel stable during this process, but they'll be positioned correctly once you add the center.








, Tie the two smaller balloons together with wire or string. The balloons should be facing opposite directions when you tie the ends together.








, Take the two flower center balloons and wrap them around the flower petals so that one balloon center appears on each side of the balloon. To do this, gently place the ends of the flower center next to the ends of the flower petals and move the flower center balloons around until the ends catch and you have one balloon center appearing on each side, surrounded by petals.





Having a flower center on each side will create a 3-D effect for the flower.

, Now that you've finished your flower, you can place it on the ground, hang it up with some ribbon, or even think about adding a stem to it.

Press the fabric with an iron if desired.",How to Dye Fabric With Coffee2," Before dyeing, wash the fabric but do not dry it. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the rub from penetrating evenly.


You can wash the fabric with the rest of your clothes or just wash it by itself, depending on your preference.
Be sure to follow the washing instructions of the fabric, if provided.

, You will need the used grounds of the coffee that is brewed. A good method to use for this is to use a French Press or use a coffee maker.


You will need enough coffee grounds to cover the entirety of the fabric that you are dyeing. You may need to brew several pots of coffee for this purpose.
Pick a dark roast to dye the fabric darker and a lighter roast if you do not wish for it to be very dark.
This is a great way to make use of your used coffee grounds. If you are a regular coffee drinker, you can save the used coffee grounds for this method.

, Once the grounds have cooled, add the coffee grounds to a large bowl and then add water. You will need about a tablespoon of water per cup of grounds.Stir the water into the grounds with a wooden spoon so that the water has evenly penetrated the mix. It does not need to be a fine paste so stirring spoon 7-8 times should be enough.

, Lay the fabric to dry on a water-proof surface. Be sure to cover the fabric completely with the coffee grounds and rub the coffee into the fabric. This can be done with a wooden spoon or similar utensil, or you can use your hands for this part.


This can be messy so you will want to do this somewhere where it is acceptable to make a mess, such as in a garage. You can also lay down plenty of newspaper to protect the floor or carpeting.

, Hang the fabric up to air dry in a place that is shaded. You will want to wait for the fabric to dry completely. This may take anywhere from several hours to an entire day. You can also dry the fabric in the dryer on low heat for approximately thirty minutes.Do not let the fabric air dry in the sun because the sun will fade your fabric., You can brush off the grounds with your hands, shake the grounds off by shaking out the fabric, or use a brush with natural fibers to remove all of the grounds. If the fabric is still not dark enough, repeat the process until it is to your liking.

, Using an iron will remove wrinkles from the fabric.


The fabric will need to be completely dry for best results with the hot iron.

Section off areas of the fabric.,
Dye the sectioned areas with the coffee.,
Place the fabric into a sealed container.,
Rinse the fabric.",How to Dye Fabric With Coffee3," Before dyeing, wash and dry the fabric as you normally would. This removes any dirt and oil that could keep the rub from penetrating evenly.


You can wash the fabric with the rest of your clothes or just wash it by itself, depending on your preference.
Be sure to follow the washing instructions of the fabric, if provided.

, The amount of coffee that you should brew will depend on how dark you would like the fabric to be. Stronger coffee will achieve a darker tint.


If you are looking to create a darker tint with the coffee, use more coffee or use a dark/very strong roast. If you would like a lighter tint, use less coffee or use coffee that is a light or medium roast.
As an alternative to preparing several batches of coffee at home, you can use instant coffee or you can purchase brewed coffee from a local store or coffee shop.

, You can put it in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes or simply wait for it to cool for a couple of hours at room temperature.

, This is so you can pour the dye onto the sections without spilling anything into other sections.


Reserve different squeeze bottles for different types of roasts (i.e. one squeeze bottle with a dark roast, another bottle for a light roast).

, You can twist the fabric and use the rubber bands to section the areas. This will ensure that you know which sections should be dyed and will also prevent the dye from sinking too far into the fabric.


Spread the fabric out completely.
Take your finger, place it in the middle of the garment, and begin turning your finger and hand clockwise.
The fabric will start to bunch up as you twist. Be sure to keep the fabric orderly and create a circular shape, like a very wide and short cylinder, similar to the shape of a pie.
Once the fabric is shaped like a pie, rubber band it in sections, as if you are dividing the pie into eighths.

, Use the squeeze bottles to pour the coffee onto the fabric. You may want to use more or darker coffee on certain sections to create a color variance.


Once you have finished dying the top part, flip it over and dye the bottom.

, Depending on the size of the fabric, you can use a plastic container or a ziplock bag. Seal the bag or container and place it somewhere warm for 24 hours.


If you have a lot of fabric, you can use a plastic storage container. They vary in size from a shoebox size to large enough to store kitchen appliances and other large items.

, Once the coffee dye and fabric have set, open the ziplock bag or the container and remove the fabric. Rinse well under cold water, until the water runs clear.

Tie a long piece of fishing line to a balloon weight.,
Inflate a balloon using a helium tank.,
Tie the fishing line to the balloon.,
Continue inflating and tying the balloons to the string.,
Anchor the other end of the string.,
Add ribbon to the bottom of each balloon, if desired.,
Decorate heavier balloon anchors, if desired.",How to Make a Balloon Arch2," Choose a balloon weight that matches your color scheme. Wrap the end of the fishing line a few times around the handle, then tie it into a secure knot.Don't tie down the other end yet.


If you can't find any fishing line, use white string instead. You can also use balloon ribbon that matches your color scheme.
If you are making a large balloon arch, tie the string to a bucket handle instead. Fill the bucket with sand, gravel or pebbles.
You can also tie string to a cinderblock if you are making a large balloon arch.

, Unlike other arches, this arch relies on floating balloons for structure. Blow up your first balloon using the tank, then tie off the tail end.You can buy a helium tank from a party supply store or an arts and crafts store. Some places will also allow you to rent them instead.

, Measure up abut 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) from your weight. Wrap the string around the tail end of the balloon, just above the knot, then tie it in a secure, double-knot., Place the balloons close enough so that they bump against each other on the sides.Work from one end of the string to the other. Leave about 12 to 14 inches (30.48 to 35.56 centimeters) of space at the end of the string empty.


If you used a cinderblock as your anchor, you will need to leave enough string to feed it through the holes on the block and tie it off.

, Measure 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) from the last balloon. Wrap the string a few times around the handle of your balloon anchor, then tie it into a secure knot.

, This is a cute touch that will make it look like the balloons are floating in an orderly fashion. Cut a length of balloon curling ribbon in a contrasting color, then tie it to the bottom of each balloon. For extra flair, use a pair of scissors to curl the ribbon., Small balloon anchors often look like little gift boxes and are pretty enough on their own. If you used a bucket or cinderblock to anchor a large arch, however, you may want to decorate it. Here are some ideas:


Cover cinderblocks with wrapping paper.
Paint the bucket with spray paint or acrylic paint.
Fill the top layer of your bucket with colored sand or gravel.
Tuck flowers into the bucket or cinderblock.

Use wire cutters to cut chicken wire for your arch.,
Bend the chicken wire into the shape you want it to be.,
Secure the arch to your wall.,
Blow up your balloons using a balloon pump.,
Secure the first balloon to the base of the arch.,
Attach the next balloon in a similar fashion.,
Work your way around the arch.,
Consider adding fillers.",How to Make a Balloon Arch3," How long you cut the chicken wire depends on how wide and how tall you want your arch to be. If the chicken wire is very wide, you may want to cut it narrower. This will make it easier to bend and curve it into an arch shape.

, It can be a perfect arch or a warped one. If you need to, loosely crumple or fold the wire in half lengthwise to make it thinner., You can do this with nails, thumb tacks, or pushpins. Start at one end of the chicken wire and work your way upwards to the peak, then work your way back down to the other end.The arch does not have to be perfectly symmetrical. Try a warped arch for a more organic design.

, For a more interesting design, blow up balloons in different sizes and colors. Try some water balloons, regular balloons, and jumbo balloons. You can also blow up regular balloons with varying amounts of air.Do not use a helium tank for this.
You can blow the balloons up with your mouth, but your lungs may get tired.

, Place a glue dot to the tail end of the balloon, just below the knot. Wrap the tail behind the wire, then press it against the knot. Hold the tail and knot together for about 10 seconds before letting go. This ensures a secure bond.You can find glue dots in the scrapbooking section or an arts and crafts store. They are dots of glue that come on a strip. Peel them off one at a time as you use them.

, Make sure that you place it close enough to the first balloon so that they are touching. Find the spot where the two balloons touch, then place another glue dot between them., Create clusters of balloons. Start with the larger ones first, then work your way towards the smaller ones. You can even place smaller balloons over larger ones using glue dots., Dried or fresh flowers work especially well for this, but you can use fake ones too. You can also tuck some colorful ribbon in between the balloons instead. This is also a great way to hide any gaps and give your balloon arch a more organic feel.


Secure the flowers to the chicken wire with glue dots or string.Make sure that the flowers don't have any thorns. If they do, cut them off with a crafting blade.

",How to Design a T‐Shirt Logo," Keep in mind that the busier the color pattern the more difficult it is to read the logo. Therefore, if you're going to design a logo that you want people to read, choose no more than two or maybe three colors.;
, While fancy fonts look pretty up close, they are difficult to read from afar. Reading a T-shirt often occurs in passing. Whether you’re walking into or out of a store or walking down the street, your font has to be large, clear and easily readable by anyone passing by.

, Similar to choosing fonts, graphics have to be clear, large, and viewable. Fine details on a logo can get lost on a small logo image. It might be necessary to forgo fine details in favor of large viewable and less detailed graphics.

, Once you've designed the logo for your T-shirt, digitize it. That means if the image was hand drawn, scan it so that it is computer readable.

, Use care not to design a wonderful looking logo only to find that it distorts when resized to fit on the T-shirt. Keep track of the logo’s dimensions to ensure it renders properly on the T-shirt.

Getting Ready


First make sure the shirt you are using is a light enough color to show through the color of your dye.,
Making Your Design


Now its time to draw your design with glue.,
Preparing Your Dye


While your glue is drying you get your dye ready.,


,
Dye Your Shirt!,
Wash Your Shirt


Use Your tongs once more to remove the garment from the dye bath.,
Dry Your Shirt


Hang the top to dry or add to the dryer.







",How to Design a Top With Glue," White works with anything however a light pink shirt may turn out well with red, or even yellow with a darker blue or green will show through nicely too you want to make sure your top is clean and not too wrinkly. Then take your shirt and pull it over your piece of cardboard making sure the area you are planning on putting your design is completely over the cardboard and tucked in underneath so there are no folds or wrinkles.;
, Make sure you have washable glue or it will be very hard to remove. Hold on to your bottle with a tight grip, slowly forming your lines while gently squeezing, making sure too much doesn't come out too fast. Once you are completely done making your design let it lay flat to dry. This could take some time depending on how thick you put your glue on.







, There are a number of different fabric dyes available out there but I just used the traditional Rit dye, which I got from Kroger for about three dollars. Fill your pot with enough water for your garment to lay and move around in the dye. Turn on the stove to high until the water is boiling then turn off and add the entire packet of dye, or whatever amount is directed. Cover until you are ready to add your top.







,,


Once the glue on your shirt is completely dry and the cardboard is removed soak your shirt in hot water. Squeeze it out and now it is ready to add to your dye. Use your tongs to pick up your shirt and place it into the bath of dye. Continue to stir your garment constantly until the desired color is achieved.







, It would be advisable to use a plastic bag underneath while holding so the dye doesn't drip over anything. Wash with warm water and vinegar at first, to stop the dying process. Then gradually add cooler and cooler water until the rinsing water in clear. Then either hand wash shirt in the sink or add to the washing machine.

Ask yourself some key questions that will help you to determine the types of persons likely to wear your clothing.,
Consider what you will have on the labels.,
Have the label designed according to your specifications and design drawings.,
Have the system in place for adding the labels.",How to Design Garment Labels for Your Clothing Line," Once you have these answers, you'll get a good idea of what's appropriate by way of labels that will attract that group of potential purchasers. These questions include:


Who is the targeted demographic you are going after?
What type of budget can you afford to spend in adding labels on your clothing? (Remembering that everything additional is more cost.)
What do you want the label to be made from? The texture of the label is important, especially if it is going to be against bare skin.
Where will the label be made? Overseas or in the USA/your home country? Again, the costs will be different depending on where you choose, so you'll need to do some research.
When do you need to get the clothing labels done by? If your clothing line is already for the next catwalk show or for sale, you'll need someone who can make the labels quickly; if you have longer, you can take more time in creating a label that will sum up your brand for years to come.;
, There are brand name labels and clothing care labels; you'll need both.


Brand labels should have great care put into developing them, as they will represent the brand for years to come. Come up with your brand's color theme, use font that expresses your brand's style and consider adding imagery if it gels with the brand, such as a flower, a smiley face or a lipstick.
Clothing care labels will need to comply with relevant local laws and laws compliant with the countries you're selling the garments in. Use standardized font and symbols for the care instructions.
Include what the garment is made of, as this is important to customers. If it has special qualities such as organic, fair-trade or hand-made, these are sales features worth promoting and may even require a label of their very own.

, Look for a branding specialist with a good track record for your demographic. They will be able to give you more recommendations and great suggestions for logos, colors and patterns for your labels and tags.

, This might be done as part of assembling the clothing in the factory or sewn on by hand for higher quality, designer clothing.

Have an idea about what you want your doll to look like.,
Create your doll using a paper pattern first.,
Select a fabric and fold it in half, right sides together.,Use the pattern to trace around the shape using a pencil line,
After you remove the pattern, cut the figure shape out carefully leaving a 1/4"" allowance for a sewing seam.,
Sew the two layers of fabric together by hand or by machine.,
Add a face if desired.,
Add details and designs.",How to Create an Art Doll," Art dolls can run from dramatic, humorous, scary, fairy-like, to the strangely weird. Just let your imagination run free.  This doll will be made from fabric, stuffed and designed to your liking. These dolls are often called ""spirit"" dolls as they capture a mood and are  great for special gifts. They can lay flat or hang when done.;
, To create a simple ""figure"" fold a piece of paper in half and draw 1/2 of the figure (like a paper doll). Cut it out and when you open the paper up, it will be symmetrical. You can free hand draw your figure to add a special feature like a tail. Birds and animals are fun to make too.

,


Iron flat if needed
Be sure the fabric is larger than the pattern

,, You may want to use pins to help hold the fabric while cutting.

, Leave a 1 opening to turn the right sides back to the outside. The best tools to do this with are a chopstick, paint brush handle or small dowel.


Do not use scissors or a lot of force because the seams may tear. The 1 opening is probably best left open at the head area where you will be adding hair and the opening will be hidden.


, Many artists create the face first because this will give the doll its personality.

You can paint a face on directly or paint the face on a different fabric and test a few out and then sew or glue around the edges. You can also get a clay molded face maker or just design your face with beads or buttons. Consider using wool felt to make faces. You will need strands of wool and a felting needle to do this type of sculptured face.






A funny face can be made by adding buttons and beads which do not match on purpose.

, The fabric's print may suggest design ideas to you. Use your instincts to embellish your art doll by adding beads, charms, ribbons, yarn or found objects. Some items may require a hot glue gun.


Clothes can be added by sewing or gluing on layers of fabric, or by wrapping cloth around the doll's form.

Gather your materials.,
Measure the V. An easy way to do this is to use a V-necked shirt that you like as a guide.,
Fold your crew-neck shirt vertically.,
Trace the V. Place a ruler in a diagonal line from the the point where the shoulder seam meets the collar down to the middle of the chest.,
Remove the stitches.,
Smooth the crew-neck shirt out on the table.,
Cut out the V-neck.,
Cut the front of the detached crew collar in the center.,
Stretch each side of the cut collar along the length of your V-neck.,
Pin the rough edge of the collar to the shirt.,
Sew from the top of the collar down to the bottom of the V. Sew approximately a quarter inch (0.6 cm) from the edge of the two layers.When you sew down the second side of the collar, stop just a little before you get to the V and sew that end to the back of the first side.",How to Cut a T Shirt Into a V Neck," To complete the project, you will need a crew-necked shirt, a ruler or measuring tape (if using a tape measure, you'll also need a separate straight edge), stick pins, a fabric marker, fabric scissors, a seam ripper, thread the same color as your shirt, a sewing machine or sewing needle.






;
, Fold the shirt vertically in half, making sure that the shoulders line up. Lay it flat on a table.Then use a ruler to measure the distance from the point where the collar meets the shoulder seam to the point of the V. Write down this measurement.









If you don't have another v-necked shirt, you'll have to estimate how deep the V should be. In this instance, it's better to start conservatively as you can always make it deeper.You may want to try on the shirt to gauge how deep you want the V. While wearing the shirt, look in the mirror and mark the spot you'd like the point of the V with a pin.

, The front of the collar should be on the outside of the fold. Make sure that the neckline, the shoulders and the arms match up exactly. Lay it out on a table, smoothing it down until it is free of wrinkles.








, Using the measurements you took in the previous step, mark off the point of the ""V"" with a fabric marker. Then draw a line between the mark and the point where shoulder seam meets the collar.









Flip the shirt over and repeat this step on the other side.

, Unfold the shirt, turn it inside-out and lay it on the table. Make sure that the front side is facing you. Then use a seam ripper to remove the stitches securing the front side of the collar to the shirt.









If you don't have a seam ripper, you can use a sharp pair of scissors to carefully cut it away.
Stop at the shoulder seams. Unless you don't plan to re-attach it to your new neck-line, leave the collar attached to the back of the shirt.

, Make sure the connected collar is folded back, away from where you will cut.Doing so ensures the smoothest and straightest cuts and helps you avoid mistakes.








, Starting on one side of the V, use a pair of sharp scissors and cut along the marked line. Stop when you reach the bottom. Repeat this process on the other side. Be careful to only cut through the front side of the shirt.









If you didn't plan on creating a hemmed collar, your new shirt is done.

, You'll need to first determine where the center is. To do this, lay the t-shirt flat with the front facing you. Measure the width of the collar, and using your fabric marker place a dot in the middle. This is where you will cut.








, Most crew-neck t-shirt collars are ribbed and should give several inches.








, Stretch one side at a time along the length of the V, pining as you go. Place pins approximately every inch (2.5 cm) to make sure the collar stretches and stays before you sew it. Do the same thing on the other side.









The rough edge of the collar should be paired with the rough edge of the t-shirt, with the edge of the collar facing the outside of the shirt.

, Finish by pressing the new hem down with an iron.









Make sure the thread in your sewing machine matches the color of the shirt.
If you don't have a sewing machine, you can also hand sew the sides of the collar to the sides of the V.

,,, Measure the fabric against the chosen flowerpot. The fabric needs to be large enough to cover the outside of the pot, as well as having enough to cover the base of the flowerpot and about 1.5 inches/2cm to wrap over the rim.

,, Decide which direction you'll work in; the important thing is to go in sections and keep working around the flowerpot in the same direction.


Work efficiently. Mod Podge will dry quickly, so the fabric needs to be attached quickly. This is why it is best to work in sections.
Add Mod Podge to the fabric as well, this will help ensure even coverage.

, Smooth out to prevent wrinkles.

, Add the next part of the fabric. Continue in this way until the flowerpot sides are covered.

, Again, use Mod Podge to keep these fabric sections in place.


Trim off any excess before the next step.

, This provides a protective layer over the fabric.

, Place on something like a plastic envelope folder or a sheet of wax paper, so that it doesn't stick to anything.

,, A fabric-covered flowerpot is best used as a vase display decoration, as it won't get dirty from adding soil.

, Take care when watering the plant and place a small glass dish or lid under the flowerpot to catch the water (or don't cover the saucer).

, For example, keep pencils, utensils or notes inside the flowerpot.

Wear protective gear when handling bleach.,
Ventilate your workspace.,
Dilute bleach with water whenever you use it.,
Keep bleach and ammonia separate.,
Check the tags of any item you intend to bleach.",How to Bleach Cotton1," Put on rubber gloves and safety goggles if you’re concerned about splashes. Wear old clothes you wouldn’t mind getting bleach on. A white t-shirt is a good choice since a bleach stain is unlikely to show up. Or you can cover your clothes with a plastic apron., Open any doors or windows to create good airflow while you’re working. If your eyes are watering, you’re using too much bleach. Step away to get some fresh air and then dilute the bleach with more water., Bleach is very concentrated and can damage the material you’re using it on, so always dilute it with water before applying it to any fabric. Use about ¼ cup (60 mL) of bleach for every gallon (3.8 L) of water when making a bleach solution., These two chemicals create toxic fumes when mixed together. Do not combine them, and thoroughly wash any container that held one before filling it with the other.The same applies to vinegar and rubbing alcohol, both of which should never be mixed with bleach.

, If it says “no bleach,” do not attempt to bleach it; the garment could be ruined. If it says, “only non-chlorine bleach when needed,” this implies that non-chlorine bleach is safe occasionally, but continuous use could damage it.If there are no words on the tag, look for a triangle shape with an open center. This is the symbol for an item that can be bleached.Also look for the fabric composition of the item. If it’s cotton mixed with spandex, wool, or silk, avoid bleaching it since these materials can be ruined by bleach.

"

Fill a bucket with cold water.,
Pour in the bleach.,
Soak the cotton item in the bleach solution.,
Rinse the item with cool water.,
Neutralize it with hydrogen peroxide.,
Wash normally.",How to Bleach Cotton2," Pour in enough water that the item can move freely in the solution. Be sure to either measure the water as you’re adding it or use a bucket with measurements up the side so that you know how much bleach to add., Use ¼ cup (60 mL) of bleach for every gallon (3.8 L) of water. Stir with an old spoon you can dedicate just to laundry purposes. Use chlorine bleach if the item is white and non-chlorine bleach (sometimes called oxygen bleach) if the item has color.You can also use regular chlorine bleach on a colored garment if you’re trying to lighten the color of the entire item.

, If you’re just pre-soaking the material to remove stains before washing, only leave it in the solution for about 5 minutes. You can add a few minutes to that time if you’re working with really tough stains.If you’re attempting to lighten the color of the fabric, leave it in chlorine bleach for up to 10 minutes., While wearing gloves to protect your skin, rinse the item under the faucet until you’ve removed as much bleach as possible. Keep the faucet running as you slowly pour out the bleach solution so that it can be diluted even more as you dispose of it., Unless you’re going to throw the item into a washing machine immediately, you’ll need to stop the bleaching action from continuing. Create a solution that’s equal parts water and hydrogen peroxide in a different bucket or in a stoppered sink. Let the item soak for about five minutes before rinsing again., Launder the item however you would normally, but if you’ve chosen to skip the neutralizing step, do not toss this item into the wash with dark colors. You will likely get bleach onto something else that you didn’t mean to. Wash it separately or with whites."
"
Set your washer to the highest heat possible.,
Add detergent and bleach if your machine has a bleach dispenser.,
Add water first if your machine doesn’t have a bleach dispenser.,
Add bleach 5 minutes into the cycle.,
Add the clothing to the washer.,
Allow the washer to run normally.",How to Bleach Cotton3," Hot water makes bleach more effective, though it can also cause chlorine bleach to release more chlorine fumes. So only use hot water with bleach in the washing machine, where the fumes will be contained., If your washer has a special bleach dispenser, you can put everything in at once. Pour detergent into the drum or its own dispenser, place laundry in the drum, and pour bleach into its dispenser. Follow the instructions on your machine regarding amounts, but typically you can use ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load. Turn on the washer and let it run normally., Add however much detergent you need for the size of the load you’re doing and turn on the water. Let the water agitate the detergent for 5 minutes., Follow the directions on your machine for how and when to add bleach. But if you’re unsure, it’s best to wait 5 minutes to add the bleach. Detergents have special enzymes that can be deactivated by bleach if the two liquids are mixed together. Waiting 5 minutes allows the enzymes to dissolve in the water first.Use about ½ cup (120 mL) of bleach for a full-sized load.
If there are any items with color in this load, use only non-chlorine bleach.

, Once the water has detergent and bleach fully mixed in, add the items you want to wash. Waiting to add them until now helps you dilute the bleach first so that none of your garments get heavy doses of bleach., When the cycle is done, your clothes should be clean and stain-free. You may need to repeat this process for items with really tough stains."

Launder as usual.",How to Airbrush T Shirts," You can draw your own design, create a design using digital image software, or find a pre-made design.


If creating or using a digital design, you will need to print the design out before you can use it. Print the design on heavy paper for best results.
Similarly, if drawing the design by hand, you should sketch it out onto heavy paper instead of sketching it out directly onto your stencil material.
The easiest option is to use ready-made stencils, of course, but this option will also provide you with fewer design options.;
, Place the design over a patch of pennant felt. Trace around the edges of the design with a pencil to transfer it onto the felt.Pennant felt is one of the best materials to use since it is durable and capable of absorbing excess paint. Cardstock, photo paper, and freezer paper can also be used but may produce messier results.
When using ready-made stencils, you can trace the design without taking any additional steps.
If using your own images, you will need to cut around the lines of the image to create a temporary stencil. After doing that, you can trace these newly created edges onto the felt.

, Place a cutting mat beneath the pennant felt, then carefully cut along the traced lines. Remove the scraps of material to reveal the finished stencil.


For most designs, a hobby knife or utility knife should work adequately well. Detailed designs tend to look better when cut out with a stencil burner, however.

, Flip the stencil over to its back and lightly coat it with repositionable spray adhesive.


The adhesive should help the stencil stay in place on the t-shirt. Make sure that you choose repositionable or temporary adhesive, though. Do not use permanent adhesive.
For best results, allow the spray adhesive to dry for a few minutes before continuing to the next step. Doing so should prevent any residue from sticking to the shirt after you remove the stencil.

, Place the stencil adhesive-side down onto the t-shirt in the desired location. Press firmly to help the stencil adhere to the t-shirt.


After a few more minutes, check the stencil to make sure that it is securely stuck in place.
It is also a good idea to secure the edges of the stencil with painter's tape. Aside from keeping the stencil steady, doing so can also protect the exposed portion of the t-shirt from over-spray.

, The best airbrush to use, especially as a novice, will be a dual action, internal-mix airbrush with a bottom feed.


When using a dual-action airbrush, you will press the switch down to draw air and pull it back to spray paint.Internal-mix airbrushes introduce the paint directly into the center of the air stream, creating an even spray of paint.
With a bottom feeding airbrush, moderately sized jars of paint are positioned to the side or bottom of the brush. The airbrush will draw paint directly from these jars as you work.

, You will need to use an air source that can provide a steady, consistent stream of air at 60 psi.


Typically, this will be either a CO2 tank or a commercial air compressor. Compressors marketed for airbrushing purposes will work for the most part, but professional grade compressors will produce even better results.

, Select pre-reduced fabric paint for this project. This paint is water-soluble and will need to be set with heat if you want the design to remain after the shirt gets washed.


Use a limited palette of colors, especially while you're a beginner.
Note that you will need to use a separate jar for each color of paint.

, Fill an empty, clean airbrush jar with enough paint for your project, then screw the jar onto the airbrush.


Start with the first color you intend to use. If you want to use more than one color, prepare the jars of paint in advance and swap out as needed while airbrushing the design.
If you plan to mix colors, you should make sure that you have made enough for the entire project. Attempting to mix more later may create slight differences in shade.

, Turn on the compressor and attach the airbrush using an appropriate hose.


Turning the compressor on first will give the machine more time to build up the right amount of pressure. After the pressure builds up, adjust the regulator as needed to get it to 60 psi.
Attach the compressor air hose to the airbrush using the attached coupling. If necessary, wrap Teflon tape around the coupling to create an airtight seal.
Introduce air into the airbrush by pressing down on the switch or by opening the metering valve.

, Place a t-shirt board inside of the shirt and set the shirt onto an easel.The t-shirt board will stretch the material, preventing wrinkles, folds, and dimples from sneaking in and ruining your design. They also prevent paint from seeping through to the other side of the shirt.
Most t-shirt boards are made of thick cardboard, masonite, or foam board.
The easel should hold the shirt at least 32 inches (81 cm) above the ground. It must be positioned in a way that allows your hand to move naturally over the shirt as you work.

, Position the airbrush over the stencil attached to the shirt. It is best to start at the edge of the design right than starting at the middle.


The distance between the airbrush and the shirt will create different effects. For a soft appearance, hold the airbrush roughly 6 inches (15 cm) away from the shirt. For a harder appearance, hold it roughly 4 inches (10 cm) away from the material.

, Gently ease the trigger back to release a stream of paint. Steadily move your hand over the entire stencil to fill the exposed areas with paint.When holding the airbrush close to the surface, ease up on the trigger to use less paint.
You need to move your hand steadily across the entire surface as you airbrush the paint onto the material. Failing to move your hand will cause globs of paint to appear at the beginning and end of each stroke.
Overlapping each pass will prevent gaps of blank space from appearing, creating a more even appearance.

, To switch colors, merely release the trigger to stop the spray, unscrew the old jar, and screw on the new jar.


Some airbrush artists prefer to use a different airbrush for each color, but for bottom-fed airbrushes, you should be able to use the same brush for all colors.

, After filling in the stencil portion of the design, carefully peel the stencil straight back to remove it from the shirt.


Remove any tape holding the edges down before lifting away the stencil.
If the stencil resists too much, you may need to wait until the paint dries before peeling it away. Doing so will minimize the risk of disturbing the paint and ruining the image.

, If you want to add freehand elements, now is the time to do so. Consider the placement carefully since there will be no way to undo any mistakes.


Letters and numbers are the most common freehand elements. Consider practicing different fonts in advance before attempting to airbrush them onto a shirt.

, Give the paint adequate time to dry before attempting to heat press it.


The exact amount of time will vary by manufacturer, but you should usually let the paint dry for at least 30 minutes. When you touch the surface of the shirt, you should not pull away any paint and your fingers should not feel tacky.

, Place the t-shirt on a hard, flat surface and cover the design with a sheet of parchment paper or brown craft paper.


Never apply heat directly to the design since doing so can actually cause the paint to peel away or stick to the iron.
If you don't have parchment paper, turn the t-shirt over and iron the reverse side.
Make sure that the material is flat and smooth before continuing to the next step.

, Allow a standard iron to preheat to the ""cotton"" setting, then carefully press the entire design with the hot iron for approximately two minutes.Heat-treating the airbrushed design should set the paint and prevent it from washing out.
Note that the iron must reach a temperature of at least 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius).
Other options for heat setting the design include:

Using a professional conveyor set to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes.
Using a heat press set to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius) for 30 seconds.
Rotating a heat gun over the surface for 30 seconds.



, Once the t-shirt cools, you should be able to wash the shirt in cold water using mild detergent. Tumble dry the shirt on low or allow the material to air dry.


After washing and drying the t-shirt once, the process is complete and the garment is ready to wear.

Stretch your silk on a frame.,
Spray the silk with a diluted mix of water and rubbing alcohol (two parts alcohol to one part distilled water).,
Apply the first layer of dye while the silk is still wet.,
Add a darker color (such as a darker shade of your primary color) next to add dimension to the design while the silk is still wet.,
Allow the first layer to dry.,
Add an even darker shade of your primary color to the dry silk.,
Add decorative touches such as simple dots.

,
Soften harsh lines by spraying on the diluted mix again.,
Paint additional designs of your choice with the darkest shade of your primary color using the wet-on-dry technique again.,
Allow the silk to dry thoroughly before putting it on.

",How to Paint a Silk Scarf," Make sure the fabric is evenly stretched, neither too tight nor too loose. If it's too loose, it will sag and the dye will make puddles. Making it too tight may damage the fabric.;
, Wet down the silk with this solution (it will later allow the dye to spread and dry with a soft edge). It also allows more time to paint as it slows down the drying time. This is called the Wet-on-Wet technique.

, In this example, red is the primary color and a simple striped pattern is used for the background. Notice how the lines have a soft, fuzzy edge to them.

, In general, always start with light shades then move on to darker colors. Since the colors in silk painting are transparent, once you go dark, it's hard to go back to light. If you want white spaces, then you should leave the silk without any color.

, You may notice some of the colors separating (shown by the presence of an orange shadow or halo next to the red in this example, even though only various shades of red were used). This happens to some colors especially when working with the Wet-on-Wet technique.

, This is called Line Building or Wet-on-Dry technique. These lines will dry with a hard edge and if the application is a bit darker in color, it will also have a dark outline around it.

,, You can also add salt to the silk as you spray to achieve a more mottled texture, as shown.

, The dye that is applied over a previously salted layer will still react with the salt and create neat swirly designs and jagged edges.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your sneakers.,
Mix the glitter paint and loose glitter.,
Begin painting the shoes.,
Apply a layer of Modge Podge.,
Try some variations.,
Experiment with an alternative technique.",How to Bedazzle Your Sneakers1," To make these glitter sneakers, you will need a pair of sneakers, some fine glitter (in the color or colors of your choice), a pot of glitter paint, a paintbrush, a roll of painter's tape and a pot of Modge Podge.;
, Make sure your sneakers are completely clean, or else use a brand new pair of sneakers for this project.


If you're using an old pair of fabric or canvas, consider putting them in the washing machine. If they are not machine washable, use a damp cloth to remove as much dirt as possible.
Remove the laces from the sneakers, then take the painter's tape and use to it to cover up any areas of the shoe you don't want to bedazzle -- such as the rubber sole and the tongue.

, Pour a large drop of glitter paint onto a paper plate, then sprinkle the loose glitter on top.









Mix with a paintbrush or lollipop stick until you achieve a slightly grainy consistency -- but don't allow the paint to become too chunky or dry.
If necessary, add more of the glitter or paint until you achieve the right consistency.

, Take a paintbrush and dip it in the glittery paint. Place your free hand inside the shoe to hold it up, then start painting!









Try to apply a thin, even layer of the paint over the entire shoe. If you pile it on too thickly, the paint may take a very long time to dry. Once you have finished painting the first shoe, do the same with the second.
Remember that you can always paint an extra layer of glitter paint once the original layer has dried. It's better to apply several thin layers than a single thick coat.

, Once the layer or layers of glitter paint have dried completely, take the bottle of Modge Podge and pour a large drop onto a paper plate. Take a clean paintbrush and start applying it to the sneakers.









The Modge Podge will seal the glitter (making sure it doesn't fall off) and add shine to the sneakers. Don't worry if it looks white at first, it will turn clear once it dries.
Leave the shoes to dry overnight, then reinsert the laces and enjoy your new glitter shoes!

, Once you have the basic method down, you can experiment with a few different variations of this glitter technique.










Use different color glitters: Instead of just using a single color glitter on your sneakers, you could experiment with mixing glitters and paints to create a cool, multi-toned sparkle. Think about mixing pink and purple glitters with silver paint, or red and orange glitter with gold paint. You could even mix all seven colors of the rainbow!

Create an ombre effect: Another good idea is to create an ombre effect by using three complimentary colors of glitter and fading them into each other. Mix each color glitter with paint on a separate plate, then use the first color glitter to paint 1/3 of the shoe, from the heel forwards. Once that layer is dry, use a clean paintbrush to paint the second color glitter on the next 1/3 of the shoe, starting about 1/2 an inch behind where the first color ended. Do the same with the third color, painting all the way to the toe. Use stencils: Instead of painting the entire shoe with glitter, you could use stencils to create glittery designs and patterns on your sneakers. Press plastic or fabric stencils onto the shoe, or create your own using painters tape. With this technique, you can create pretty shimmering butterflies, stars, hearts, flowers, skulls -- anything you like!

, Instead of painting the glittery glue onto the shoes, you could try sprinkling it instead!









All you need are a pair of canvas sneakers, a bottle of fabric glue, some fine, loose glitter, a pot of Modge Podge and a paintbrush.
Paint a layer of fabric glue onto the canvas parts of a clean pair of sneakers (with the laces removed). Hold the sneakers over a sheet of newspaper and start sprinkling the loose glitter directly onto the glue.
You'll need to work quickly, to ensure that the glue doesn't dry. Once you have cover the sneakers in a layer of glitter, give them a gentle shake to remove any excess.
Paint a layer of Modge Podge over the sneakers to seal the glitter and add shoes. Leave the shoes to dry overnight before reinserting the laces and wearing."

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare the sneakers.,
Start adding the crystals.,
Continue adding crystals.,
Buff the crystals or rhinestones.",How to Bedazzle Your Sneakers2," To bedazzle your sneakers with crystals or rhinestones you will need:









A packet of flatback crystals or rhinestones. How many you need will depend on how much of the surface of the shoes you intend to cover.
A tube of e6000 adhesive. This is a very strong craft adhesive which will prevent your rhinestones or crystals from coming loose. It should only be used in a well-ventilated room.
A jewel setter. This is a small plastic stick which has a ball of wax on one end. It is used to easily pick up and set small jewels during craft projects. If you you don't have a jewel setter, you can use a pair of tweezers.
You will also need a piece of sandpaper (or an emery board), some rubbing alcohol, a clean cloth and a pair of sneakers.

, Although you can apply crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like, only applying them to the rubber toe of Converse-like tennis shoes creates a very cool, designer-style effect. However, in order to do this, you will first need to prepare the rubber:









Take the piece of sandpaper or emery board and rub the toe of your sneaker for a minute or two. This roughs up the surface of the rubber, creating a better surface for the adhesive to bond to.
Take the clean cloth and dip it in the rubbing alcohol. Rub the cloth over the sanded rubber toe to remove any rubber residue or dust. The alcohol will dry very quickly, so you can proceed with your crafting immediately!

, Take the tube of e6000 and apply a thin line of adhesive around the toe of the sneakers, in a semi-circle from one edge of the fabric to the other. You should only work with a single line of adhesive at a time, as it dries very quickly.









Open the pack of crystals and lay them out on the table beside you, shiny side up. Take the jewel setter and press it gently into a single crystal to pick it up (don't press too hard or it will become embedded in the wax).
Press the crystal gently onto the prepared line of glue. Use the opposite (pointed) end of the jewel setter to press the crystal firmly onto the shoe. Continue adding more crystals along the line of glue, using the same technique.

, Add a second semicircle of glue just inside the first row of crystals, then add a second row. Continue in this fashion until the entire toe of the sneaker is covered in crystals.









Once you have finished with the first sneaker, repeat the process with the second one. Then leave the adhesive to set for 15 to 20 minutes.
You can use the same technique to add crystals or rhinestones to any part of the sneaker you like -- you bedazzle the entire shoe, or use carefully placed crystals to create stars, hearts and other patterns.

, If you used the jewel setter, your crystals or rhinestones may look dull rather than shiny.









This is because they are covered in a layer of wax. Take a clean, dry cloth and use it to buff the crystals until they are clean and shiny.
Don't worry if any of the crystals come loose -- just apply another dot of adhesive and stick on a new crystal."

Write on them.",How to Bedazzle Your Sneakers3," Changing your laces can completely change the style of your sneakers. Purchase some wacky patterned laces, dye a pair of white laces your favorite color, or replace your normal laces with some pretty ribbons.








, Take a pair of plain black or white sneakers and a selection of neon colored fabric paints. Dip a clean paintbrush in each individual color and use it to flick the paint onto the sneakers.








, Take a chenille needle and some pearl cotton thread and use it to embroider pretty patterns onto your fabric sneakers. You'll need to learn some basic stitching techniques, but otherwise this craft project is super easy!








, Another very simple way to jazz up your sneakers is just to paint them with fabric paint. You can use a block color, paint alternating stripes, or create a cool geometric design. Use small, thin-tipped paint brushes for greater control.








, For a cool psychedelic effect, try tie dyeing a pair of white fabric sneakers. For more detailed instructions on how to tie dye fabric, see this article.








, You can easily embellish a pair of fabric sneakers by sewing on buttons and beads. You can create a polka dot effect by sewing the buttons or beads on at even intervals all over the shoe, or you can create beaded patterns and pictures.







, Take a black permanent marker with a thin nib and use it to write on draw on your sneakers. You can write individual words like ""peace"" or ""love"", write out the lyrics of your favorite song or poem, or even get all your friends to sign their names!

Use your doormat.",How to Make a Welcome Mat Using Paint," The best doormats to use are flat ones with a low pile, but the typical, bristly/coir type of doormat will also work. Keep in mind, however, that the typical coir mats do soak up a lot of paint, and may require multiple layers of paint.

The mat can be any shape or size—it can even be a circular mat!
The doormat does not have to be new. It can be an old one!;
, If the doormat is used, you might want to beat it with a stiff, bristle brush or vacuum it to get rid of any dust or debris. If you don't do this, any dust or dirt might get mixed into the paint and dull it down.


If you see any loose ends on your mat, trim them off with a pair of scissors.

, The best place to work would be outside, but you can also work in a large room as long as there are several windows open. Cover your floor with newspapers, a drop cloth, a plastic tablecloth, or several garbage bags., You can use either spray paint or liquid paint. Spray paint is great for covering large areas. It is also quick and easy to use. Liquid paint needs to be applied with a foam brush, and is better for smaller, more intricate areas.

If you are using spray paint, choose something that is good-quality and that is labeled as being indoor/outdoor. Enamel interior/exterior paint will also work.If you are using liquid paint, make sure that it is meant for outdoors. Porch paint is a good choice because it is durable., You can also do this with a brand new mat as well if you don't want the raw material to show. To make it more durable, use primer first.Let the paint dry completely before applying the stencil.

, You can buy a stencil from the store. If you want a more unique design, you will have to make your own from scratch using contact paper. Keep reading to find out how.

If you are using a store bought stencil, secure it now to the doormat using painter's tape or masking tape. If it is small, and you plan on using spray paint, mask off the rest of the doormat using newspaper to protect it.

, Even if your design is small, it would still be a good idea to do this. This way, you will be able to keep the rest of your mat clean while you paint., If you have a larger design, you may need to print it out onto several sheets of paper. Alternatively, you can also sketch your design onto the back of your contact paper freehanded or using a stencil.


Make sure that your design is big enough to that it is proportionate to the mat.

, If you drew your design directly onto the back of the contact paper, you can skip this step., Place your contact paper onto a cutting mat with the stencil facing upward. Use a craft knife to cut through both the printed paper and contact paper. Remove any pieces of tape and regular paper that might still be stuck to the contact paper stencil when you are done.

If you do not own a cutting mat, you can use a sheet of cardboard instead.

, Contact paper is not very sticky, so it likely won't stick to your doormat very well. In this case, you can secure it with sewing pins. Simply poke the pins straight through the contact paper and into the mat. Focus on the areas that have a lot of detail.Some people find that spraying the back of the contact paper will also help it stick., You can do this using spray paint or acrylic paint. As you are painting, you may notice the material soaking the paint up quickly. Simply wait a few minutes, then go back over those areas. If you wish to add more colors or details, wait for the first coat to dry.


If you are using spray paint: hold the can 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) away from the surface of the mat, and spray straight down. The force of the paint presses down onto the stencil and prevents bleeding.If you are using a foam brush: saturate the brush, then press it against the bristles of the mat. Continue applying the paint using a tapping motion. Don't paint back-and-forth, or you'll risk getting paint under the stencil., It can take up to 24 hours for the paint to dry.You may need up to three coats of paint, especially if you are painting sisal or coir., You can do this while the paint is still wet. Once you are done painting, carefully remove any pins or pieces of tape, then carefully peel the stencil away. Be careful not to touch your design. Even if it looks dry, it might still be wet around the edges., You can speed things up by setting it out in a sunny spot for a few hours. If you are using liquid paint, be sure to read the label carefully; some paints requiring a curing time as well.

, Once the paint is completely dry and cursed, set your doormat down in front of your door. Keep in mind that because the fibers are only painted, the colors may fade over time."

Use water-soluble pens for see-through designs.,
Use invisible markers where it will be hard to remove the line by covering with a design.,
Use iron-on pens for opaque fabrics.,
Check the pen carefully.",How to Choose Fabric Pens for Sewing Projects," These pens work well when tracing a design onto a fabric through which the design shows. This type of pen is good for fine fabrics such as organza, fine cotton (lawn), and organdy.;
, These markers have the advantage of fading away a few days after they are used on fabric. The disadvantage is that if you're slow to sew, your lines will disappear.

, These are water soluble and come in either a once use or multiple use version. When using this, make sure that you have reversed the design.


If using an iron-on pencil, keep it sharp for fine lines.

, Before using any fabric marker, check that it is working properly and that it is fresh. It should have a firm tip, not a fuzzy tip. Fuzzy tips will cause the marker to run on the fabric.

Choose a button down shirt to bead.,
Select beads and/or jewels.,
Obtain a needle and thread that you can use to sew the beads/jewels.",How to Add Jewels and Beads to a Shirt1," You’ll want a color and design that will compliment the beading and jewels you plan to add (or you may want to match the jewels and beads to the shirt).


Consider choosing a shirt that is 100% cotton as this fabric will hold the beading better than a more delicate material.
Pre-wash your shirt so that you have the proper fit and size prior to sewing (to avoid having the shirt shrink after the beads have been sewn onto the garment).;
, Visiting a bead store will be your best bet to have the widest selection. Consider bringing your shirt with you so you can see what the beads/jewels will look like before you make a purchase.


Make sure each jewel/bead has a hole that will allow you to sew it into place.
Ask the bead store clerk how the beads/jewels you select will hold up being washed.

, Go for stronger thread since you will be attaching a bulky item to your shirt.


Make sure the thread color matches the beading/shirt color so the thread will be unnoticeable.

Consider taping the beads into place while you work so you don't forget the pattern. Use a fabric tape that will allow you to adhere the beading/jewels without damaging the shirt.

, Add several stitches to each bead/jewel to ensure it is set in place.

",How to Make Something with Glitter for a Teacher," It is possible to get some clues from what he or she teaches. It may also be a good idea to give something useful to your teacher. For instance, writing materials will be of use to your teacher since teachers usually have to mark many assignments.;
, For example, one traditional gift for a teacher is an apple. You could buy an apple shaped foam/polystyrene ball and create a glitter apple.

, Teachers tend to receive many gifts from many students. Making your gift stand out and creative using glitter will show your teacher that you have put in great effort and will surely make his or her day.

, (See the Things You'll Need list below).

, This will prevent the glitter getting all over the place.

, Make sure you have covered only the wooden part of the pencil.

, Ensure that just the right amount of glue is used. Too much glue will make it hard for the surface of the pencil to dry later on, causing the surface of the pencil to be sticky. You will not want your teacher's fingers to be stuck to the surface of the pencil while using it! Too little glue will make it hard for the glitter to stay on the surface of the pencil, which may then fall off when your teacher is using it.

, Make sure the glitter covers the pencil entirely. Another method is to pour the glitter into a small tray and dip the pencil into the tray to cover it with glitter.

, Once the pencil is dry, shake off the excess glitter. Tapping the pencil over a blank sheet of paper (gently of course), will take off all excess glitter.


The same steps can be carried out for pens too!

, (See the Things You'll Need list below). Cover your work surface with newspaper.

, You can use cardboard, construction paper, or cardstock.

,, You can also cut it to different shapes (a heart or apple shape, for example).

If you plan on using a pre-made image, like one used by your favorite artist, video game, or TV show, you should should find a high resolution copy of the image. High resolution images will result in crisper, cleaner stencils.Beginners might want to stick with simple designs while learning the basics of stencil printing. A simple line drawing or thick, plain, black text will work well for your stencil.;
, This can be easily done on a computer with image editing software, like Adobe Photoshop or MS Paint. You might import an image from online or your personal image library and make some modifications to it with your editing software, or you might use your own original artwork. If you don't have a printer, you can always look into how to make a stencil by hand.


With image editing software, it will be easy for you to move around components of the design until you are happy with it. Text, in particular, will likely require some adjustment for you to get the right placement and size.Compare the size of your design to your substrate, which is the technical name for the thing you'll be stenciling onto later. This will prevent you from creating a stencil that is too large.
Some examples of substrates you might stencil your design onto include: t-shirts, backpacks, posters, towels, walls, folders, and so on.
You might want to change your image properties to ""Black and white"" before printing. This will make it easier to identify the parts you will need to cut from your image to make your stencil., You should print your image in black and white on a sturdy piece of paper, like card stock or posterboard. Depending on your printer, you may be able to cut a piece of white posterboard or card stock down to the size of a normal sheet of paper and use it in your printer as you would normally.


Depending on your region and printer, your standard paper size may vary. Generally, you can expect most printers to accept paper 8.5 inches (21.6 cm) wide.
Sturdy paper will result in a sturdier stencil. Using normal paper for your stencil might cause it to fall apart while stenciling., Take your utility knife and cut around the perimeter of the black areas of your image. Try to cut in an unbroken line around the perimeter to limit the number of touch-ups you'll need to make at the end. If you need to cut through the blank space surrounding your image, cut a thin line from the border of the page to the perimeter of your image, then cut the image free by following its perimeter.


Do not throw away any of the pieces of your stencil. Depending on the kind of stencil you want to make, you might use either the white pieces or the black pieces when stenciling.
Be careful not to trim floating or protruding ares of white space. Even if a white space is mostly or completely surrounded by the black of your image, you should keep it. All white pieces should stay together with other white pieces and black pieces with black pieces.
In stencil making, the white part of your stencil is called the positive stencil while the black parts make up the negative stencil.Be careful not to damage the surface you are cutting on! You may want to put a piece of cardboard or a self-healing cutting mat beneath your design while cutting., The best place to apply your stencil is a clean, sturdy, flat surface, like a table, desk, or counter. Make sure your substrate and surface are both clean before placing it onto your surface.Put an extra layer of unused posterboard or card stock beneath your substrate so it is under the area you plan on applying your stencil. In the event your paint bleeds through, this will prevent an unnecessary mess on your surface.
If you plan on stenciling bags and backpacks, you should insert a piece of stiff cardboard inside to prevent your paint bleeding through to the inside or opposite side of the bag.
If you don't have cardboard or extra posterboard/card stock, you can always use an old board game box.

, Before you go any further, you'll have to figure out which stencil you'll be using: the positive (white) or negative (black). Positive stencils are great for letters and outlines. They also give the appearance of your image being part of the background of your shirt. Negative stencils are better for figures and details. Negative stenciled images will appear to be in the foreground of your shirt., This is especially important for your negative stencil, as you will not have the border of your page to orient your stencil as you will with your positive stencil. Using small pieces of painter's tape, mark the placement of your stencils.


With painter's tape marking positioning, you'll have an easier time aligning your stencils with your substrate. Your tape guides will also prevent you from stenciling something crooked.
The positive stencil will be the easier of the two to position on your substrate. Use the outer edges of the page of your positive stencil to place it and mark its position with tape.
To mark the position of your negative stencil, first place your positive one. Use the outer borders of the page of your positive stencil to position it precisely. Then mark the interior of the positive stencil. This is where you will need to place your negative stencil before applying your paint.

, Hold your substrate free of its surface and allow it to hang naturally in your hands. While holding the substrate, check to see that your painter's tape guides are even and straight; small errors will result in a skewed or uneven image. Return your substrate to its surface and correct any errors in tape placement, then align your stencil with your tape guides.


Stencils can sometimes stick to your paint applicator and come free from the substrate. This can sometimes result in poor image quality. To prevent this, you can use double sided tape (or a loop of tape with the sticky side out) to attach your stencil to the substrate., If you're using the positive stencil, you'll be painting its inside. If you're using the negative stencil, you'll be painting the outside. In either case, it doesn't matter if you get paint on your stencil. You should not, however, get paint under the stencil; this will result in the border of your design being irregular and not looking clean.


Pour a moderate amount of your suitable paint, like fabric paint in the case of t-shirts, into a paint tray. In place of a paint tray you could use several paper plates or even pieces of wax paper. Then, using either a brush or sponge, transfer paint to your substrate.
If you don't have a paint brush or sponge, you can always use cheap hand towels or rags. Layer a few of these together and roll them up to make a fabric tube. This will be your makeshift applicator; dip it into your paint and dab it onto your substrate.
Be careful not to rub or brush against your paint while it is wet. This can cause it to smear and can even result in a stain on the clothing you are wearing., Removing your stencils before the paint is completely dry can result in paint-smear. Be patient while waiting for your stenciled image to dry. To speed this process, you might use a hair dryer or low intensity fan directed at the drying paint.


Another technique that you might use to help your design dry involves an iron and wax paper. Lay your wax paper over your design and, in short intervals, run the iron over the wax paper slowly but steadily., When your paint is fully dry, peel one edge of your stencil carefully away from your substrate. Do not remove your stencil completely at this point. With your stencil still mostly attached to your substrate, check the first layer of paint you used for your stencil design. If it looks thin or light in color, reattach the corner of the stencil you've peeled away and apply another coat of paint.


If your first layer of paint is consistent and you have achieved the desired color, continue to peel your stencil free from the substrate until it is completely removed. If you plan on using your stencil again, place it somewhere safe; otherwise you can throw it away., Now that your paint is dry, you can add artistic touches to your design. Especially if the negative space where you applied your paint is lacking in color or personality, use your paints and a brush to add personal touches to the design.


Some stencils might not transfer certain features very well, like eyes, for example. In this case, you might want to use a paintbrush to add these features., You can do this in the same fashion you did previously. Either wait until the paint is dry or speed the process along with a blow dryer. When the paint of your finishing touches is dry, your stencil printing project is complete.

Print or sketch a simple design.,
Trace your design onto a sheet of clear contact paper.,
Cut out your stencil.,
Peel the backing off, then stick the contact paper to the t-shirt.,
Place a sheet of cardboard inside the shirt.,
Apply fabric paint over the stencil.,
Wait until the paint dries, then peel the stencil off.",How to Stencil a T Shirt1," Choose something with solid, dark lines, so that you can see it through the contact paper when you go to trace it. Even though you will be using clear contact paper, the paper backing will make the design harder to see.This method is suitable for intricate designs and reverse stencils/silhouettes.;
, Tape your design to a flat surface first, then tape your contact paper over that. Trace over the design using a permanent marker.If you are having trouble seeing the design, tape the whole thing over a bright window.


Do not remove the paper backing from the stencil just yet.

, Remove the contact paper from the template, but don't peel the backing away. Place the contact paper onto a cutting mat, then cut out the designs using a sharp craft blade. If you have any inner designs, save those as well., Figure out where you want the design to go first, then gently set the contact paper down. Start at one end, then smooth it down until you reach the other. Make sue that you flatten out any ripples or wrinkles.If you had any cutouts for inner designs, be sure to stick those down as well.

, The cardboard only needs to be a little bit bigger than the stencil. This will keep the paint from soaking through the fabric and staining the back of the shirt.

, Squeeze out some fabric paint onto some sort of palette, then dip a foam brush or a pouncer into it. Gently tap the brush against the stencil; do not drag it past the edges. Avoid using too much paint, otherwise it will loosen the contact paper and leak underneath it.

, As the paint dries, run your hand inside the shirt, between the fabric and the cardboard. This will prevent the paint from sticking to the cardboard as it dries.


Some types of fabric paint need to be heat-set after they dry. Each brand will be a little different, so be sure to read the label on your bottle of paint carefully!

, Tape your design to a table first, so that it doesn't move around, then tape the freezer paper on top of that, shiny-side-down. Trace use a pen to trace over your design once more.If you are having trouble seeing the design through the freezer paper, tape everything to a light table or a bright widow.
Make sure that you are using freezer paper, not wax paper or parchment paper., Transfer your freezer paper to a cutting mat. Cut out the design as precisely as you can using a craft blade. You can also try using a small pair of scissors. Do not cut past the outline of your design.

If your design has an inner shape, save that shape.

, Place the freezer paper, shiny-side-down onto your shirt where you want the design to be. Iron the entire shirt using a hot, dry iron. The heat of the iron will cause the freezer paper to stick to the shirt.Focus on the edges of the freezer paper.
If your design has an inner shape, iron that shape to the shirt as well.

, The cardboard needs to be a little larger than your design. It will prevent the paint from soaking into the back of the shirt., Squirt some fabric paint onto a paper plate, plastic lid, tray, or any other sort of pallet. Dip your pouncer brush into the paint, then lightly tap it over the stencil. Do not drag it back and forth and do not over-saturate the shirt.You can apply more than one layer of paint. Wait about 20 minutes before doing so.You can also use fabric spray paint instead. This is great if you want to use multiple colors for an ombre effect., This can take a few hours to overnight.As the shirt is drying, run your finger under the fabric to separate it from the cardboard. This will prevent the two from sticking together. Once the shirt is dry, you can pull the cardboard out., Discard the stencil, or save it for another design. Freezer paper stencils usually last for a few designs; they do lose their adhesive power overtime, however.

Some types of fabric paints need to be ironed after they dry. Read the instructions on your bottle of paint for any further instructions.

Make sure your stencil isn't broken, chipped,  or missing a character.,
Use the correct writing utensil.,
Ensure that your writing implement is in top condition.,
Sharpen your pencil so it's very sharp.

,
Lean your pencil left and right to get to the edge of the template.,
Do not exert undue pressure on the template.,
Rotate your pencil gently as you trace.,
Use an eraser shield.,
Go over your outline to darken it.,
Strive for uniformity of line width and density.

",How to Use a Stencil," You can't spell ""Cat"" if you're missing the letter T!;
, Pens don't usually work so well, unless they have an ultra-fine point. Pencils are often a better choice. Make sure you're comfortable with your choice, though.

, It should have plenty of ink and not be broken.

,, As you trace the outline, make sure to go right along the outline.


It also helps to lean your pencil along the forward path of the pencil.
If you must pause, it is best to lift your pencil and resume the trace leaving a small gap. Whenever you start the trace, apply just a tad more pressure to compensate for the tendency to start light and transition quickly to a dark trace. The normal eye does not see small gaps in an outline and fills those in naturally. However, if you do not tilt your pencil at the same angle when you resume the trace, there will be a small jag and your eye will pick up on that.

, This will cause it to deform and you will lose the crispness of your design. Also, make sure to keep downward pressure on the template near your trace so that the pencil tip cannot slip beneath the template. Throughout the trace, the template should be firmly seated and not moved.

, This will ensure that the point stays sharpened to the max. It takes a while to get used to this technique, but you can practice by lettering free hand and doing line drawings to refine the technique. Once you have established the habit, it will become second nature and will kick in automatically as you start to trace for maximum line crispness.

, If the lines smudge or smear, use a metal eraser shield to aid your clean up.

, Make several lighter, accurate passes and the outline will naturally darken.

Purchase enough contact paper to cover your stenciling area.,
Print your stencil.,
Cut the printed stencil with an Xacto knife.,
Clean your glass thoroughly with glass cleaner like Windex.,
Apply the contact paper to the stenciling area.,
Trace your printed stencil onto the contact paper.,
Apply an etching solution to the open parts of the stencil.,
Rinse the glass.,
Peel off the contact paper.",How to Stencil or Frost a Mirror," You can buy this at your local home improvement or craft store.


You may have found a stencil that is already cut out of plastic or vinyl. If so, you can skip the rest of the stenciling directions.;
, This will be your template, not the final stencil. You can use regular computer paper, or card stock for durability.


There are some nice nature-based stencils on the internet, which you can find using a quick google search.It may take you awhile to find a design you really like. Consider using a crafting site, or visiting Pinterest. Keep in mind that you will be cutting the stencil out of contact paper, so the more complicated your design is, the more complicated the final product will be to cut.

, Remember, the part that you will be etching is the part that you are cutting out. Once you etch the glass, the frosted glass will appear lighter-- so make sure you’re cutting out the right part.


Most stencils that you find online will take this into account. It is just important to remember in case you want to improvise.

, Dirt will make it hard to adhere your stencil to the glass, and may interrupt the function of the etching solution.


This is also a good time to put your glass in a ventilated area and protect the surface that it will be lying on.
Make sure that the glass is dry before continuing to the next step.

, Do not peel the entire back off the paper and try to apply it all at once. Instead, remove one corner and apply it, smoothing out any air bubbles. Slowly apply it to the rest of the mirror, smoothing out bubbles as you go.


If you have a few bubbles, don’t worry. You will be able to fix them once you have cut your stencil.

, Then cut it out with an Xacto knife. Use this time to smooth out any air bubbles you may have created when applying the contact paper. You can even cut the bubbles and smooth them down.


Most people like to apply their design to the border of a glass or mirror, so that you can still use the mirror. If you have a very large mirror, you can use larger designs near the bottom or top and still have use of the mirror.
Contact paper will work for any kind of design, from ornate to simple. This is because it creates a good seal between the glass and the etching compound.

, You can use a bristle brush, or a Q-tip in a pinch. Don’t touch the glass with your brush or Q-tip, however-- your brush marks will show up. Instead, use generous amounts of cream, and daub it onto the surface of the glass.


You can buy an etching solution at Walmart, or try shopping online.Use a designated brush-- etching solutions are made of acid and can damage most brushes.

, Depending on the kind of etching solution that you use, your wait time may be as little as 45 seconds. Use a wet sponge and a bucket to remove the etching cream. Rinse the glass carefully with the sponge.


Etching cream can be very potent, so do not get it on the rest of the mirror, or it might etch where you do not want it to.

, Make sure all the etching solution is rinsed off, and then peel the contact paper from the mirror.


You can rinse off any adhesive or residue. Once your glass is etched, it’s etched forever, and washing it will not harm your design.

Glitter the canvas.,
Paint the outlines.,
Paint the background of the image.,
Add a layer of glitter fill.,
Add a second layer of glitter fill.,
Paint on top of your initial glitter layer.,
Reinforce the outlines.,
Let the painting dry under the sun.,
Add more layers of glitter.",How to Make a Glitter Painting," You can buy one for just a few dollars. You can start with one that's just 8""x10"" to practice. Pick a canvas that is gallery wrapped -- meaning it has staples in the back, not the front. Make sure it's a stretched canvas as well.;
, To do this, you'll need a thick acrylic paintbrush to cover the entire canvas with one solid color. Acrylic paints dry fast, so you may want to keep them wet by spraying them with a spray bottle of water, or just by mixing a bit of water with the paint. Once you've painted the canvas with acrylic paints, you can gently shake the glitter onto the canvas so it will harden into the paint. It will stick when the paint is not too wet and not too dry.


You can shake the glitter on using a shaker or by scooping it up with a spoon and gently spreading it out over the paint.
You can also paint a section of acrylic paint, add on the glitter, and then move on to paint and glitter another section. This will distribute the glitter more evenly.
When you're done adding the layer of glitter, smooth it down with a pencil, and then shake out the excess glitter onto a piece of paper.
Wait 24 hours for the glitter to dry before moving on to the next step.

, Once the glitter is dry, use a brush to paint the outline you've chosen for your painting over the dried glittered surface. Pick a color of acrylic paint that contrasts with the background instead of blending in.

, Paint the background outside of the image, so that only the inside of the image remains covered in glitter.

, Paint inside the glittered image with acrylic paints. You can create any design you want, using a thin or a thick brush to create a pattern. You can paint circles, add to the features on a face, or create entirely new images.

, Once the first layer dries, you can paint over the same parts with acrylic paints again, using a different color of paint this time. You can also water down these paints a bit more to create a lighter, less solid look.

, Once the two layers of glitter fill dry, use a solid color to paint over the initial glitter layer entirely. You'll still be able to see it peeking and shining underneath, but it should be completely covered.

, Paint inside the glittered parts inside the images to create starker contrast. Use black paint with a thin black brush to do this. Notice how the man's blue eyes become black with a little reinforcement.

, Give the paint a few hours to dry. Since you haven't added a new layer of glitter, you don't need to wait 24 hours.

, For a final touch, repeat the process of glittering to the background of the painting. Pick a new color of glitter this time to add a new dimension to the painting. You can glitter the entire background, or just part of the background, to create a new image, such as adding hair to a face. After 24 hours, rub or shake off the excess glitter again.

",How to Make Ribbon Hair Clips3," You should pick a variety of colors and patterns to make your final product more colorful and visually appealing.

, Find an ordinary metal hair clip that is around 2--3"" (5--7.5 cm) long. Take out the middle of the clip, the part that keeps the clip down. Set it aside -- you'll be putting it back later.

, Line up all of the tips of the ribbons and pinch them at the top as the rest of the ribbon hangs down.

, Place the ribbon ends over the top of the clip, facing up, and run the thread around it at least 4-5 times until its securely in place. Then, tie the thread in a knot 3-4 times to hold the ribbon down. Cut off the extra end of the thread.

, Place your thumb underneath the five pieces of ribbon and arrange the ribbon over it to create a loop that fans out at least 1"" (2.5 cm). You'll be making five of these, so work out the proportions accordingly so that you don't run out of ribbon or have too much left over. You can always rework the ribbon if this happens.

Avoid choosing something that will be going outside or has a lot of sharp/faceted edges, however. Keep in mind that glittered glass tends to be delicate, so something that will be going outside or heavily used is not a good glittering candidate.;
, Wash the glass using warm water and dish soap. Rinse it off well, then wipe it dry. This will get rid of any surface dust and dirt that might prevent the glue and glitter from sticking. It is a good idea, even for store-bought items that look clean.

, This will get rid of any oil and residue that the regular washing did not get rid of. Any oils left on the glass will prevent the glue and glitter from sticking.

, If you want the entire object glittered, then there is no need to do this. Keep in mind, however, that if you plan on glittering a cup or wine glass, you will need to leave the 3/4 inch (1.91 centimeters) un-glittered.Use adhesive glass stencils to create delicate designs.
Use stickers if you want the entire object glittered, but a shape un-glittered.
Use masking tape to create cold designs, such as stripes and zigzags.

, Glass is a very smooth surface, so it will be difficult to get glue to stick to it permanently. Etching cream will roughen up the surface, and make it easier for the glitter to stick. It is great for small designs, but may be uneven in larger ones. Different brands may have different instructions, but listed below are the basics:Put on a pair of vinyl or plastic gloves.
Apply the cream using a popsicle stick.
Wait 5 minutes.
Rinse the cream off in a stainless steel sink. If you have a glaze or porcelain sink, use a bucket instead.Pat the design dry.

, The best type of glue for this would be a glue used for glass and ceramic projects. Decoupage, Mod Podge, and similar types of glue are also popular for these types of projects, but the finished piece will not be as durable. Avoid using tacky glue, school glue, or basic white glue. They are water soluble and will not last very long.

, Avoid using a paintbrush, if you can; paintbrushes are more likely to leave behind visible streaks and strokes.Wait for the glue to dry, then apply a second coat. The first coat ""primes"" the surface, while the second coat gets the glitter.


If you are working on a large area, consider applying the glue to only a small patch first. This way, the glue won't dry by the time you get around to glittering it.
If you want to use more than one color, choose one color to start with. Apply the second coat of glue to the areas with that color first. You'll add the other color(s) after the first one dries.
If you want to create a fading or ombre effect, apply the glue over the entire area you want glittered. This will help the colors blend together.

, You can use any type of glitter you want, but extra-fine glitter (found in the scrapbook section of an arts and crafts store) will give you a more professional looking result. Keep in mind that iridescent glitter tends to be somewhat translucent, while metallic glitter is completely opaque.


If you are creating an ombre effect, apply your first color halfway up the design.
If you are covering an entire object with glitter, hold the object on its side and slowly rotate it while you shake the glitter on.

, Turn the project on its side, and gently tap or shake it to knock off any excess glitter. If you are creating an ombre effect, be careful not to get the glitter past where you want the first color to end.

, If you apply your second color too soon, some of the colors may mix and stick together. This can create a messy look. If you are doing an ombre effect, work quickly to add your second color before the glue dries.

, Apply some more glue, then shake on your second color. Keep doing this, color by color, until your design is complete. If you are creating an ombre effect, shake on your second color. Then, take your first color, and sprinkle it a little bit past where the second one begins. This will help ""blend"" the two colors together., If the glitter smears, you can carefully push it back into place with a toothpick, and wipe off any excess with a damp Q-tip.

, If you see any bare spots, take a thin paintbrush and carefully apply some more glue. Shake on some more glitter, then tape the excess off.

, Depending on what brand and what type of glue you used, this can take anywhere between 20 minutes and 4 hours. Some glues also require a several days curing time. Read the label on your bottle of glue for more specific drying instructions.

, This will brush off any excess glitter that the tapping did not get rid of earlier. It will help prevent the glitter from shedding when you go to seal it., Always move your brush in the same direction: top to bottom or side to side. To lock in your design, extend the glue just past the edge of the design and onto the glass itself. You don't have to extend it by a lot, a millimeter or two will be enough.Make sure that you are using a sealer with a glossy finish. If you use a matte, semi-gloss, or satin finish, your glitter will lose its sparkle and look like sand instead.
Unless your sealer says that it is waterproof or dishwasher safe, your project will not be washable. You can gently wipe the glittered area clean with a damp cloth, but you cannot wash it.
If your sealer says ""dishwasher safe,"" use caution. Do not leave your item soaking, or the glitter will peel off. It might be better to hand wash them instead.

, Choose a clear, glossy-finish sealer; don't use a matte, semi-gloss, or satin finish, or your glitter will loose its sparkle. Apply a light coat of the sealer. If you glittered just one part of your project, such as a wine glass stem, wrap a plastic bag over the un-glittered part. Even though the sealer is clear, it may still change the ""look"" of glass.Some people find that spraying their projects with glitter helps make them more durable and hand washable.This is great if you have to cover large areas.
If you glittered a wine glass base, consider spraying the bottom and edges as well, to ""seal"" the glitter in.

, If the sealer still looks too thin, you may apply a third coat; make sure that the second one is completely dry though.

Choose a suitable jar.,
Assemble glitter and food coloring.,
Boil enough water to almost fill the jar.,
Add a few drops of food coloring.,
Add the glitter.,
Place the lid on securely.,
Use.",How to Make a Glitter Jar1," The jar can be as small or as large as you'd like, from a baby food jar, to a Mason jar and beyond. Just be sure you have sufficient glitter and food coloring for the jar size you're going to use.


Clean the jar before use, to remove any food residue from it.;
, The food coloring should enhance or match the glitter coloring. There should be plenty of glitter; it is suggested that you use about 1.5 tablespoons of craft glitter and 1.8 fl oz of glue glitter per Mason jar amount of water.


The craft glitter can be shaped if you prefer, such as little stars or animal shapes. Check your craft store to see what's on offer.

, Pour the boiling water into the jar.

, Go slowly, adding only enough to reach the color you desire.

, Tip in the craft glitter and the glitter glue. Stir to mix through.

, Check that it won't fall off.

, Whenever you want some sparkle in your life, or you need to calm yourself in some way, give the jar a good shake and watch the glitter swirl around for a time, creating a beautiful scene.

"
"
Choose a suitable jar.,
Decide on a pattern for the jar.,
Cut the double-sided tape to the pattern or design you're making.,
Add the glitter.,
Give the glitter a hand by pressing it into the tape to ensure that it stays in place.,
Brush excess glitter off the jar.,
Done.",How to Make a Glitter Jar2," If the jar is to be a decorative item, then it's important that the jar looks good. Keep back suitable jars from your cooking or rummage through old jars at bazaars or thrift stores.


Clean the jar well and allow to dry thoroughly before proceeding.

, There are lots of possibilities for the jar style, so you'll need to narrow this down to what pattern, shapes or effect you want. Some examples include:


Stripes (horizontal, vertical or zigzag)
Solid chunks of glitter color (for example, the bottom half or the top half of the jar, or one side/portion only)
Circles or other geometric shapes
Letters, and so forth.
If you want the whole jar covered in glitter, either use bands of double-sided tape carefully stuck around the jar overlapping each other until the whole jar is covered or buy sheets of double-sided tape, which allow you to cut the double-sided tape to the exact size of the jar.

, Stick the tape onto the jar with great care, ensuring that there are no wrinkles or bubbles.


If you make a mistake, pull it away and begin again. If an area that shouldn't be sticky is sticky, wipe off with a little lavender oil or other sticky-spot remover.
It tends to be easier to work with double-sided tape that retains the backing on the front side of the tape until you've finished adding it and are ready to add the glitter. At that point, simply pull off the front-sided backing and begin to work with it.

, Work over a large piece of paper that will allow you to collect the glitter that doesn't make it onto the jar. Sprinkle the glitter over the tape and ensure that it is sticking in place.


It might even work to roll the jar over glitter on the paper catching excess glitter.

, Keep adding glitter to areas of the tape that have been missed, to ensure thorough coverage.

, Use a soft bristled paintbrush to brush off excess glitter that hasn't stuck onto the jar or that is simply sitting on the glass itself.

, The glitter jar is finished now. Pick up the excess glitter on the paper and carefully funnel it back into the glitter bottle.

Find a suitable jar.,
Select the paint color and the glitter color so that they complement each other.,
Lay down a piece of box cardboard to cover the work surface.,
Turn the clean jar upside down on the cardboard.,
Spray the jar or jars.,
Leave to dry.,
Decide where you want the glitter line to be.,
Paint Mod Podge at the point of the line, around one row or circle of the jar.,
Repeat in rows or circles around the rest of the jar, in sections.,
Let the glitter sit for an hour.,
Finish with a coating of Mod Podge to protect the glitter and keep it in place, especially when handling or if the jar is knocked.,
Done.",How to Make a Glitter Jar3," Mason jars are often ideal for this project, as they have plenty of space for adding flowers, candies or other items to.


Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.

, For example, you might have a rose pink jar with gold glitter; or a silver jar with red glitter. Try to avoid the exact same paint color with the same glitter color, as the glitter will tend to be overwhelmed by the paint color; use variant shades of the same color if you want the same color theme, preferring the paint in the paler hue and the glitter in the brighter or darker hue. The exception to this is metallic paints with the same metallic glitter color––these tend to look terrific.


Choose high quality craft glitter for the best effects.
The paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. Spray paint is recommended, as it's easy to apply and goes on evenly.

, Be sure the place you're spraying the jars in is well ventilated, to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.

, If doing more than one jar, add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard, for spraying at the same time.

, Don't get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip, leaving drip marks on the jar's surface. Spray evenly.

, Follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times, checking regularly. Once you're sure it's dry, you can proceed.

, This is the line from which the glitter will go down to the base of the jar (or from an area to the top of the jar). Around a quarter to halfway up from the base is recommended. Place a row of tape around where this line begins, to mark the spot.

, Sprinkle glitter right around this row or circle.

, You can't Mod Podge the entirety of the base (or top) section because the Mod Podge dries out too quickly to allow the glitter to stick. Just work through it methodically and you'll get there.

, This allows it to set properly.

, Let this dry for another hour.

, The glitter and paint jar is now ready for use. It can be used to hold flowers, pens and pencils, lollipops, trinkets, etc. In fact, whatever you like really!

Choose your stamp.,
Use permanent ink for quick-drying and precise lines.,
Use pigment ink for richer color.,
Press the stamp firmly in the ink multiple times.,
Line up your stamp on your paper.,
Run your finger over the top of the stamp.,
Pick the stamp straight up.,
Let the ink dry completely.,
Layer stamps for a more sophisticated look.",How to Use a Rubber Stamp1," The type of stamp you use depends a lot on the project you’re doing. Smaller stamps are great for cards, while larger stamps work for larger projects. Having a variety of stamps is probably best – it gives you some choice when you sit down to work on a project.

You can also get wood-backed or clear stamps. Clear stamps will give more control over placement because you’ll be able to see exactly where the edge of the stamp is.;
, The lines created with a rubber stamp that uses permanent ink are very sharp and will dry quickly. This makes permanent ink great for precision work like stamping addresses or words., Pigment ink takes longer to dry, but it will give you a brighter, more vibrant color. It’s good to use if you’re stamping greeting cards or decorations of some kind. It’s also great for layering, since the colors won’t get lost in each other., This is true regardless of the type of ink you use. Don’t just smash the stamp into the ink once. Check your stamp a few times in between presses to make sure the ink is evenly covering the stamp., Be extra careful if the paper is not much bigger than the stamp; you don’t want to lose part of your design. Don’t rock the stamp as you press down. Instead, apply even, steady pressure., This is especially important if you’re using a larger stamp. Running your finger over the top ensures an even application of ink without you having to rock and wiggle the stamp., After you’ve pressed down, pick it straight up to avoid smearing the ink., Depending on the type of ink you use, it can take between a few minutes up to a half hour for the ink to dry. If you're not sure if it's dry yet, very gently dab your finger over the ink. If any color comes away, it's not dry yet., Let the ink dry in between stamps if you want clear and distinct colors. You can also stamp over still-wet designs to create a more integrated look. This is an especially cool look if you’re using water-based markers, since the inks will often bleed into one another."

Take care when washing.",How to Transfer Photographs to Fabric1," Liquitex acrylic gel medium is cheap, and can be found near the paint at any craft store. You can also search for Mod Podge Photo Transfer Medium. This is a specific kind of Mod Podge-- regular Mod Podge will not work for fabric. On the internet, you might find more specialized mediums.If you have trouble finding what you are looking for at a craft store, ask someone who works there.;
, Most people want to use photo transfers for T-shirt fabric or canvas, which is pretty foolproof. Synthetic fabrics are a little bit more difficult to transfer to. If you are planning to transfer to synthetic fabric, make sure that you test it out with similar fabric first. Your transfer will probably not fare well on stretchy fabric.


The stretchier the fabric, the more wear and tear your transfer will have to endure. This is why transfers are often on linen or canvas.

, If you use a gel medium, you will need a laserjet image. You can also use old magazine pages or newspaper images.Some people say that if you use Mod Podge transfer medium, you can use inkjet images as well as laserjet images.If your image has text, you need to flip it horizontally on the computer in order to get the image to transfer correctly. Most programs that you use to open an image have this option; you do not need to use Paint or Photoshop.

, You can use a regular bristle brush to do this.


The coat of medium should be quite thick. You don’t want to be able to see the image when you are done coating.

, Make sure that all of it is touching the fabric, and smooth out any air bubbles. Let it sit over night.


Some people say that it is not necessary to let your image sit overnight if you use gel medium. If you peel off the paper before it has dried completely, your transfer will appear faded., The paper will start coming off. Continue to rub it until all the paper is gone.


If you are using the transfer for display, you can use another coat of gel medium to protect it.

, It is best to wash your transfer by hand.If you do have to machine wash your transfer, turn the fabric inside out and don’t use your dryer.Don’t dry clean your transfer. The harsh chemicals will take a toll on the image.

Breathe on the stamp.",How to Use a Rubber Stamp2," Water-based markers are good if you want different parts of the stamp to come out in different colors. You should first make a design plan so you know for sure which colors need to go where on the stamp., Using the water-based markers, color the stamp. You can have some overlap between colors since water-based markers will blend into one another., Once you’re finished coloring the stamp, breathe directly on it to re-wet the ink. The ink should be shiny before you stamp it to ensure all of the color transfers to the cardstock or paper you’re using."

Apply even pressure.",How to Use a Rubber Stamp3," You can use craft paint or even regular paint if you’re stamping on furniture or walls.If you’re working on a larger project, pour some of your paint onto a paper towel. This will act as a big ink pad.

, Tap the sponge onto the stamp repeatedly. Keep doing this until you see an even coat of paint on the stamp. If you’re using paint on a paper towel, dip the stamp into the paint on the paper towel.If you use the paper towel technique, spread some newspaper under the paper towel to prevent any bleed through.

, It’s especially important not to press too hard on your stamp if you’re using paint. If you do, the paint might smoosh out of the sides of the stamp., Don't favor one side of the stamp over the other. This can make one part of your stamped area look really light, while other parts look darker. Instead, place your palm over the center of the stamp and press down evenly."

Peel off the paper.,
Try again.,
Turn your garment inside-out to wash it.Hand-washing your transfer is best, but if you must wash it in a machine, turn it inside-out so that other clothes don’t wear on it.",How to Transfer Photographs to Fabric2," This is available at Best Buy, Walmart, Michael's, and other craft and office supply stores. Make sure that the paper that you choose matches the kind of printer you have, so that you are not using an laserjet printer to print on inkjet transfer paper..


Pay attention to details listed on the package. Most iron-on transfers require cotton or cotton blend fabrics. If your garment or item is dark colored, look for 'Transfer to Dark' paper.

, Upload your photo to your computer, and use Paint or a photo program to adjust the size of the photo to suit your needs.


When you cut out your image, round the corners of the photo. That way, the corners will not peel after multiple washings. If you have a graphic, cut as close to the edges as possible, and round your corners. Never have sharp edges on your transfer.
Keep in mind that any white spaces in the photo will be the color of your garment or item.

, Apply the transfer face-down on the fabric, so that the printed side is against the fabric.


Take care not to tear the image as you peel the backing off.

, Make sure that your iron is very hot, and is not emitting any steam, as this will ruin the transfer. Iron on a hard, non-porous surface instead of an ironing board.


Most irons have a setting that you can alter to stop them from emitting steam, but you can also make sure there’s no water in the iron.

, You can peel one corner to check your image first. If it is spotty, you can carefully put it back and iron some more. Some people like the distressed look of half-transferred images, so feel free to experiment if this is something you might like.


Do not wash your item for 24 hours.

, If your iron-on transfers did not work as well as you hoped, try doing things differently the next time.You may have printed on the wrong side of the paper. If your image faded, you may have washed before waiting 24 hours. If your image peeled off, you may not have rounded your edges very well.


You need to iron on a hard surface, keep your iron at maximum heat, and apply a great deal of pressure when ironing. Transfers require a lot of heat and pressure in order to stick, so if you do not apply enough hot, even pressure, parts of your transfer may not stick.

, Letting the garment air-dry also preserves the transfer.


Use a gentle soap.Don’t mix any bleach into your wash.

Purchase a canvas stretcher frame at a craft or art supplies store.,
Purchase your mesh.,
Staple the mesh into the frame.",How to Screen Print at Home1," These are basic, inexpensive frames made of wood for mounting a canvas. For a little more money you can purchase an aluminum frame that will last longer, as repeated washing will warp a wooden canvas.Many art stores now sell pre-made silk screens as well, so you could purchase a standard screen if you don't want to make a custom one.
Ensure that your frame is big enough for your design. If you don't know your design yet, or want a versatile frame for multiple designs, aim for 12x18"" at the minimum.;
, You want a nice, fine mesh that allows the ink to pass onto the shirt, paper, or design. Mesh-count measures how loose or tight the mesh is, where higher numbers indicate a tighter mesh. The tighter the mesh, the more intricate your details can be. Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch.


For the classic ""athletic"" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count.
For a ""do-it-all"" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count.
For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250.
In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts. So if you're doing white paper, aim from 230-250., Make sure you pull the screen tight before you start stapling. You want it to be as taut as possible without ripping. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple around the wood every 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm.).


You will likely need an electric staple gun to securely adhere the mesh.You can also use framing nails.

Create a stamp to create a design.,
Pick out paint for your project.,
Brush the paint onto the block or stamp.,
Practice first.,
Press your stamp on to the fabric on a flat surface.,
Allow your fabric to dry.",How to Print Your Own Fabric1," Sketch out an image or design onto a linoleum block with a pencil. This gives you the option of tweaking the design before you start to carve. Then, use a carving knife or a carving tool from a craft supply store to whittle away the block until only your design is left. The deeper you cut away the excess linoleum, the less likely you'll end up with smudges on your fabric.


Keep your first trial run simple. Use an image with few colors and clear lines so that you can determine how your printer places ink on your fabric before moving on to more complicated patterns and images.
Common designs for beginning to block print can be squares and triangles since they can overlap and repeat in geometric designs, or abstract images since it requires less accuracy with carving straight lines.Remember that if you carve a design, the raised part will be what is printed on your fabric so be aware of negative space when drawing up your design.
Linoleum is the most common material for block printing. Other options include a piece of wood, a large rubber eraser that can be carved into like wood, or any kind of household item that could leave an interesting print.;
, You'll first want to decide if you want to use one color or more in the overall design. Then, make sure you have paints that are oil-based or are meant for fabric.


Oil-based paints will take much longer to dry but they have a much richer texture. Oil-based paint stains are also notoriously difficult to get out of fabric which is why a solvent is required, but that's good news for your fabric because it will not wash out easily or quickly.If you're going to use oil-based paint, make sure you have a solvent on hand that can help clean up any stains.
Fabric paints can work as well but they do not apply to fabrics as smoothly as oil-based paints.
Both kinds of paints can be washed, but it's best to treat your fabric after printing and read the instructions for care for your particular paint.

, You can dip you block in paint and paint try but using a foam brush or foam roller to lightly coat the surface is better.This way you'll get more of an even coverage and won't end up with large globs of paint.


Excess paint can drip and create an uneven design, but you may find that you want a more uneven design that looks more natural rather than a uniform pattern.
You can also you a finer tipped paint brush to apply paint. With this method you can use more than one color paint as well since you'l have more control over where the paint is on your stamp. Make sure that you keep any different paint colors that you use separate so that you can avoid mixing and keep the colors crisp.
Be careful to avoid getting too much paint on the rest of the stamp when coating it. If you press the stamp off-kilter you could end up with random splotches of paint within your design.

, Use a scrap piece of fabric or paper to make sure that you can align your stamp correctly or that you get the impression you wanted. This is where you can check for imperfections in your stamp design. You also should practice how you want to space out your stamps if you are aiming for a repeating pattern.

, Place some cardboard or drop cloth underneath the the fabric so that if any paint bleeds through it won't ruin your surface underneath and any excess paint will be absorbed. When block printing on a double-sided material, protect the other side by slipping a piece of cardboard in between.You can choose to create a uniform pattern or not. For example, you can alternate shapes or colors in a repeating pattern that covers the whole fabric, or you could sporadically stamp and leave large blank spaces.
Stripes are an easy-to-replicate pattern as well as polka-dots.
But as you go, make sure to press the stamp straight down on the fabric and lift up straight up as well. Pressing or lifting on an angle will disperse the paint unevenly. Additionally, stamping with different amounts of pressure will create a distressed look which you may or may not desire. This is where you can truly customize your fabric based off of how you utilize the stamp.

, Do not handle it immediately or the ink may bleed. For best results, place the fabric gently over a cooling rack used for baking or dry ground before folding or handling. The fabric will need anywhere from a day to a few days to dry completely before it will be completely set. After the paint dries, you can use your fabric for anything.


For best color-staying results, soak your printed fabric after it dries in a vinegar bath for 10 minutes. You can rinse with water to get rid of some of the vinegar smell but it does fade on its own."

Create a stencil of your design.,
Know the artistic limitations and challenges of screen printed designs.,
Sketch your design onto the poster board.,
Cut the design out as a stencil.,
Alternatively, draw your design on transparent paper.",How to Screen Print at Home2," Silk screens can only apply one color at a time, so create a simple shape or outline to begin learning. Whatever you draw will eventually be the inked part of the print. To make your own print, you need:Poster board, thin cardboard, or other thick & sturdy paper.
Pencil
X-acto knife or another precision knife

, Screen printing isn't difficult, as what you draw is exactly what you get on the final print. However, there are certain principles and limitations to screen printing that you should know as you design your print:


You can only print 1 color at a time.
High contrast images (like black on white) work the best, as you cannot using shading.
For complex designs, you need to make multiple prints, one for each color, and layer them after the ink has dried., Sketch out the blocks of your design. You can upload photos or other images into photo editing software as well and use those. To do so, reduce the drawing to a basic two-tone outline then print it.


To make a stencil on Photoshop, for example, you would take a black and white image and click Image → Adjustments → Threshold, then set it up near the highest it can be., Everything that you cut away will be un-inked on the final print, and everything covered by the stencil will be covered in ink. For example, imagine you are printing the red logo of a bulls-eye on a white t-shirt. When you cut out the stencil, all of the rings that you cut away will be white, and all of the rings that are covered by the stencil will be red.

, For complex prints, it can be very difficult to cut out the entire outline. In this case, use thick black ink on transparent paper to make your stencil.


Your stencil or drawing needs to block light, as this is what etches the design into the screen and allows you to print. Everything covered by a stencil or black ink will not get exposed to light, leaving it ""open"" and allowing ink to pass onto the shirt or item.

"
"
Coat your silk screen with a thin layer of photo emulsion.,
Let the emulsion dry in a dark space.,
Set up an ""exposure area"" while waiting for the emulsion to dry.,
Place your screen under the light in the exposure area.,
Put your stencil backwards on the middle of the screen.,
Turn on the light for the recommended time.,
Blast off the emulsion with cold water.,
Line up your screen above the object you're printing on.,
Squeegee some ink over your design.,
Slowly pull off your silk screen.,
Repeat with as many shirts as you want, cleaning the screen occasionally.",How to Screen Print at Home3," Pour a line of emulsion along a side of the screen and use the squeegee to spread a thin line along the entire screen. Photo emulsion reacts to light, hardening when exposed, so anything not covered by your stencil will turn into a barrier preventing ink from getting through.


Apply emulsion to the flat side of the frame, not the side surrounded by wood.
Do this in as dark a room as possible to prevent the emulsion from hardening before you're ready., Expose it to as little light as you can. A closet or bathroom will work well, as long as you can close some curtains

, You'll need to expose the emulsion to direct, strong light to prepare it. Following the specification on the photo emulsion bottle, set up a light above your flat black surface. Each emulsion has different times, watts, and distances needed for proper hardening, so be sure to read the bottle before beginning. The lamp should always be 1-2 feet above the emulsion.


If the emulsion calls for 30 minutes at 200 watts, set up a lamp with a 200W bulb 1-2 feet above a table. The screen goes under the light.

, As you're moving the screen, cover it with a towel so it does not react to incidental light. Place it under the lamp in your station, leaving the towel on for now., The screen should be emulsion side up. The mesh will be lifted a few inches off the table and resting on the frame. Place your stencil in the middle of the screen with 4-5 inches of space between the design and the edge of the frame.


You must place your stencil down in reverse to get the right image. Look at your stencil the way you want it, then flip it over before you put it down. Otherwise, you will get a mirror image when you start printing.
If there is a breeze, or your stencil is very light, place a clear piece of glass on top of it to keep it from moving.
Do not push, prod, or move your screen, light, or stencil once it is placed and set., Simply follow the instructions on your emulsion bottle and remove the screen when it is done. When it is done, remove the stencil and set it aside for later. If you smell anything burning during this process, turn off the light immediately.


If you prepared the emulsion correctly, you should see the faint outline of your stencil in the emulsion when the design is removed.

, Take any high-powered water source (shower, faucet, hose) and wash off the screen, focusing on your image. The water will wash away the unhardened emulsion around your design. You should see the outline of your stencil appear. Keep on spraying until you can see your image well. Let the screen dry before moving on to the next step.

, The mesh should be touching the whatever you're printing on, like paper or a shirt.


If you're using a shirt, slide some cardboard between the layers of the shirt to prevent the ink from bleeding through.

, Put a thin line of ink just above your design. Then drag the squeegee over your design firmly, coating the entire stencil in ink.


The harder you press the darker your image will be. , Pull the screen off the t-shirt/paper with even pressure, then hang the shirt up to dry. Your design will be printed.

, You can use your silk screen again with another t-shirt if you want, adding more ink as necessary. Simply wipe down the backside after every shirt and reapply ink. If you're using the same print for multiple days in a row, rinse and dry it at the end of each day.

Buy fabric that can be printed on by a ink-jet printer.,
Attach a stabilizer and cut your fabric to size.,
Check your printer and ink cartridges to make sure they are compatible for fabric printing.,
Start out with a simple design for your first project.,
Use a photo-editing computer program or other website to edit your design.,
Check your computer settings before printing.,
Place the fabric in your printer and feed it through gently as it prints.",How to Print Your Own Fabric2," You'll want either a 100% cotton or silk with a tight fiber weave for best resolution so the ink will stick and your image will be clearer.You can find pretreated and precut fabric for printing at craft stores. These are usually already stiffened for printing. This method will save you other steps in preparing your own fabric pieces but can also be more expensive.You will also need a fabric stabilizer. Fabric will not feed as easily into a printer as regular paper does so you will need to attach a stabilizer to guide it through your printer without it jamming. Options include freezer paper ironed shiny side down to the back of the fabric, 8.5""x11"" office stickers stuck to the back of the fabric, cardstock with spray adhesive or tape,or fusible webbing., Iron out your fabric on a dry setting so that you don't have any bumps or wrinkles while attaching the stabilizer. Then, lint roll the fabric to pick up any stray fibers that will get in the way of printing and produce a smudged image. Use a craft cutting mat with a grid printed on it for accuracy to measure out a piece of fabric that will fit through your printer. Most printers have the capacity to print on 8.5""x11"" pieces.


For freezer paper, cut a piece of paper to the size your printer takes and iron it shiny side down onto the fabric, then cut the fabric to size using scissors or a rotary blade.
Or, you can cut the fabric to size, iron an uncut piece of freezer paper to the fabric, and then trim the sides of the freezer paper so that the edges line up perfectly.It can help to leave about 2 inches of stabilizer to feed through the printer rollers to catch the material.
Office supply stickers or labels are also efficient to use. You can peel off a label and stick it to your fabric and then trim as needed. These labels won't leave much residue if any and they come pre-sized for printing.If you use spray adhesive or a spray-on chemical to stiffen the fabric, make sure you have a drop cloth or other protective surface beneath it. Don't oversaturate the fabric or it will become too stiff to use once it's printed. After spraying, let it dry completely before feeding through your printer so it doesn't get jammed.

, The best kind of at-home printer to use unless you are looking to print commercially is an ink-jet printer which can use both dye and pigment ink cartridges.


Dye ink is not water resistant on its own but if you want to print with it, you can pretreat your fabric to be waterproof with chemical solutions like Bubble Jetset found at craft supply stores.Pigment ink is the best option and will be water resistant with only a little leakage when its first washed.
To find out what kind of ink cartridge you have or want to buy, look up the serial number online or use a search engine to find specific brands to use., Chances are you have an idea in mind for what you want to put on your fabric.You can use different mediums to create your design:


Photos you have taken
Drawings or paintings scanned into the computer
Images or text pulled from the internet

, Whether you start out with a rough design on paper or a photo that you scan into the computer, you will want to upload it into an editing program to make it fabric-ready. There are several free programs, such as GIMP, PicMonkey, Aviary, and Inkscape, that are available online as well as software that you can buy for a more professional finish to your images such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator.

, In many editing programs you can select different picture resolutions in the settings. You can always test out your design by printing on a normal piece of printer paper to make sure that everything is aligned correctly.


Whichever measurement your computer uses for image resolution, whether it's pixels or DPI (dots per inch), select the highest setting so that you get the best quality print.Additionally, check the color settings for your printer and computer and make sure that they are aligned.You can use sites that translate hex and RGB color codes (two different ways to indicate to computer programs the color you want to use) to color correct your design.Choose the highest resolution possible to ensure the best quality image for your design. Most computers have an option for ""Printer Preferences"" where you can select different options and for many, the option you should select is ""Best Photo"" quality.Scout out other fabric printing websites for ideas and suggestions. There are several websites that provide printing services that also exhibit their client's designs in galleries so you can look through other's people's projects and gather ideas for your own fabrics. Popular sites include Spoonflower, Digital Fabrics, Woven Monkey, and Fabrics on Demand.

, Watch carefully as it prints to make sure that nothing gets snagged in the process. As the fabric prints out from the machine, catch the edge of it and keep it raised off of the printing tray so that any damp ink doesn't smudge or smear. Let the fabric sit out to dry on a flat surface before handling.

When shopping for acetate, also known as transparency film, look for the thin sheets. Thicker sheets of acetate are harder to cut through. You don't have to use a rotary cutting mat, but you will need something to cut on. You will need the following to make your stencil:A rotary cutting mat
A craft knife
Thin acetate
Masking tape;
, You can find free stencil templates online, or you can make your own. Depending on the design, making stencils can be quite complicated.Print your stencil design onto thick card stock. Make sure you it is the right size for your project., Using masking tape, tape a sheet of acetate to the printed image. Then, tape both the acetate and the image to your cutting mat.Masking tape works better than scotch tape. Painter's tape also works well.To make sure your image doesn't move around while you are cutting, tape all the edges down to your cutting surface., Use your craft knife to start cutting away the unwanted areas from your image. If you downloaded a stencil template, it should have instructions on which areas to cut away from the image.Work from the middle out. The more you cut away from the image, the weaker your stencil will become. Take your time, and work carefully. You can make a stencil last a long time if you take care of it., Once you finish cutting your image, remove the masking tape. You should now have a sheet of acetate with your cut-out image. If you see any hanging pieces on the acetate, simply pop them out., If you plan on printing your design on a t-shirt, make sure you wash and dry it beforehand. Search online or at your local craft store for the following:T-shirt or some other fabric
Foam roller
Textile ink
Wax paper
Cardboard
Masking tape

, If you are printing on a t-shirt, place a piece of cardboard inside the shirt. If you are working with some other piece of fabric, such as a handbag, place a piece of cardboard under the area you'll be painting. You need a firm surface to roll the paint onto.Tape the acetate stencil over the area you want to paint. Use masking tape to tape down all the edges. Make sure the stencil is secure. You don't want it to move when you start rolling your paint on., When shopping for textile ink, look for something that is water-based. You should be able to find a variety of colors, or you can mix your own. You can make quite a few colors if you have red, blue, yellow, black, and white inks on hand.Mix the paint on a plate or a shallow dish. Use just enough to cover your image., Once you've mixed your paint to the desired color, roll your foam roller through the paint. If you spot any lumps, roll them out., Make a light pass over your image with the foam roller. Don't worry about getting a lot of paint on the fabric with the first pass. You want to make several light coats as opposed to one heavy coat.Once you make the first pass, you'll find that the acetate sticks to the fabric. This will allow you to use a little more pressure on the next few passes.Pay attention to the stencil. If there are a lot of pieces that are barely attached, take care not to disrupt them., Before you remove the stencil, use a hair dryer to apply a 2-3 second blast of heat. You don't want the paint to dry completely before removing the stencil, but you don't want it wet either.Loosen the tape around the edges of your image. Starting from the top, gently pull the acetate away from the fabric. Take care not to ruin the image you painted, or damage the acetate screen. If you take care of your stencil, you can use it multiple times., Once the paint is completely dry, you need to heat seal the image. Leave the cardboard under the fabric and place a piece of wax paper over the shirt. Run an iron over the wax paper to seal the ink.Different inks will require different levels of heat to seal. Refer to the instructions on your ink for ironing details.If you don't have any wax paper, use a clean piece of cloth.You can remove the cardboard once you've sealed the image., Hot water can be harsh on your clothes. To prevent your print from fading, and to keep your fabric from wearing thin, use cold water on a gentle cycle.Try hand washing your shirt in colder water the first few times to make sure the image is set into the fabric.When you wash, turn your shirt inside out to protect the print.Avoid using any harsh chemicals when you wash your shirt., Avoid using a high-heat setting on a dryer. Heat can cause your clothes to shrink and may cause the image to fade. Air drying takes longer, but could extend the life of your shirt.If you are in a rush, you can speed up the air drying process. Set your dryer to a low heat and remove your shirt from the dryer halfway through the cycle. Hang your shirt to let it finish drying., Unless your shirt is noticeably dirty, you don't have to wash it. Even if you take care of your clothes, washing will wear them down over time. If you only wore your shirt for a few hours, fold it back up and wear it again before washing it."

Cut a piece of freezer paper to the same size as your fabric, 8 ½ x 11 inches (27.9 cm).,
Iron the freezer paper to the fabric.,
Inspect fabric and trim thread before placing it in the printer.,
Place fabric sheet in your printer tray.",How to Print on Fabric Using Freezer Paper," Base your decision on whether or not your printer supports color.


Consider how the graphic will transfer to the fabric and whether you want something relatively small or a graphic that will fill the entire fabric sheet.
Keep in mind that photos may change resolution and size during the transfer process.;
, You’ll want the fabric to be the same size as the paper you use in your printer.


Consider using fabric that is 100% cotton, like a 200 count muslin for best transfer results. The ink will pop and be brighter with the right fabric.
Make sure you trim rough or frayed fabric edges so they don’t get caught in your printer. Not only could this ruin your project, loose thread inside your printer could damage its mechanism.

, You will essentially be “marrying” the two together so they need to be the exact same size.


When purchasing freezer paper, make sure it says “freezer” on the box. Don't confuse wax paper with freezer paper, which is a common problem.
Cut enough sheets at the same time to complete all the fabric in the project.

, This will join the freezer paper and fabric together, allowing both to pass through your printer.


Set iron on the highest setting. The high heat will easily bind the fabric to the freezer paper, but work quickly and carefully so as not to burn the fabric.
Press fabric to the shiny side of the freezer paper. Gently press down on the iron as you smooth it over the fabric. Be sure you run the iron over each edge to ensure each side is joined together.
Iron on a smooth, flat surface for best results. If your ironing board has bumps, consider using a thin towel placed on a heat resistant countertop as a makeshift ironing board.

, Even though you may have trimmed the thread already, the ironing process may have produced more fringe.


Use sharp, fabric scissors to trim paper/fabric. Inspect the paper/fabric to ensure it is still stuck together.

, Keep in mind which side will print on the fabric.


Conduct a test run, if necessary, by placing an “x” on one side of a scrap sheet of paper, running it through the printer and seeing which side gets printed.
Conduct a test run with the image until you are satisfied. Unless you have multiple sheets of fabric/freezer transfers, play with your printer’s settings until you are satisfied with the outcome.

Lift away the stencil.,
Iron the t-shirt.,
Wear and wash the t-shirt.",How to Print Designs on Plain Tshirts1," To print on a t-shirt using a stencil, you only need a few basic supplies. You may have most of them around your house. If not, you'll find what you need at a craft or art store. Round up the following materials:


A t-shirt. A plain, basic cotton t-shirt is fine. Know that some paints and inks will bleed through thin cotton, so if this is a concern for you, you might want to choose a thicker blend. The color you choose should be light enough (or dark enough) that the paint colors will show up well.
A stencil. You can buy a pre-made stencil from a craft store or make your own using cardboard.
Paint or ink. Acrylic fabric paint is a good choice for printing on t-shirts. You could also go with a fabric ink or stain. Look for a type that won't come out in the washing machine.
A small paint roller and paint tray. You'll need this to apply the paint to the t-shirt evenly. If you don't have a roller, you can use a wide paintbrush.
Tape. This is to hold the stencil in place while you apply the paint. Masking tape works well for this purpose.;
, Cotton t-shirts shrink in the wash, so it's important to run them through the washer and dryer before you print on them. If you wait until after you print, the design might end up getting warped. When the t-shirt is dry, iron it to remove any wrinkles.

, Lay out some butcher paper or scrap paper on a hard, flat surface. Place the t-shirt on the surface and straighten it out so that it has no folds or wrinkles. Place the stencil on the part of the t-shirt where you want to print the design. Tape the edges of the stencil to the t-shirt to hold it in place.If you're worried the paint is going to bleed, place a piece of cardboard inside the t-shirt; this will prevent the paint from seeping through the shirt to the other side.
To prevent paint splatters from getting on your nice clothes, you might want to put on an old t-shirt before you start painting.

, Pour the paint into the tray. Roll the roller over the paint a few times so that it is distributed evenly around the roller. Do a little test roll on a piece of paper.

, Using firm, steady strokes, use the roller to fill in the design in the stencil. Cover the entire design and overlap the stencil by an inch or two. Take care not to accidentally apply paint to areas outside the stencil.

, Carefully lift the stencil from the t-shirt and set it aside. Now wait for the paint to dry completely before touching the t-shirt again.

, Once the paint is totally dry, place a clean cloth (such as a thin dishcloth) over the design. Set the iron to high and iron over the painted area of the t-shirt. This helps set the paint in place so that it won't easily come off., You're now free to wear your new t-shirt. Wash it by itself using cold water the first few times it gets dirty. With time you should be able to throw it in with the rest of your laundry.

Choose a backing material that will be easy to adhere the glitter to.,
Design the arrow.",How to Make a Glitter Arrow for a Path1," This might be heavy weight card or wooden board such as plywood. If you want the sign to be long lasting, plywood or similar wood is the best option. A wooden sign is less likely to blow away in a breeze. Plastic sheeting could also be used but you'll need special special glitter for that, to prevent it from simply peeling right off.;
, The arrow needs to be large to be obvious.


Measure how large you would like the arrow to be. Go to the path area where you want to place the arrow and use a ruler or tape measure to work out a suitable size for the arrow.
Draw the large arrow design on brown paper or similar large paper. Arrow designs are plentiful online, so if you don't want to draw one freehand, print one off to copy or trace over.

Ink the screen.,
Lift the screen and let the ink dry.,
Use the screen again.,
Wash the screen.",How to Print Designs on Plain Tshirts2," Screen printing is an art form that can be as complicated or simple as you want to make it. The basic concept is using a screen to evenly distribute the paint around a stencil. Using this method, it's possible to apply several layers of color and make intricate designs. Here's what you need:


A t-shirt. You can screen print on most types of fabric, but cotton works best for beginners. Be sure to wash, dry, and iron it before using.
A screen. These are available at art supply stores. Choose one that's about the same width as a t-shirt.
Screen printing ink. Pick out one or more colors to create your design.
A squeegee. This is used to smooth the ink over the screen and apply it to the t-shirt.
Craft paper. Use craft paper that is cut to the same size as the screen.
A craft knife. This is used to cut your design into the craft paper.

, Use the craft knife to cut a design out of the craft paper. You might want to draw it before you start cutting. Make the design as simple or as intricate as you'd like. If you want to create more than one layer of color, make a different stencil for each color., Cover a flat surface with butcher paper or scrap paper. Place the t-shirt on the surface and smooth out any folds or wrinkles. Put the paper stencil on the t-shirt where you want the design to be. Place the screen over the stencil.

, Put a spoonful of ink onto the top of the screen. Use the squeegee to spread it evenly down the screen. Make a second swipe with the squeegee across the screen.It may take some practice to get the hang of inking the screen (and the t-shirt below it). Try to make just two swipes: one vertical swipe and one horizontal. This will ensure you apply the right amount of paint in an even coating.
Make sure the edges of the paper stencil extend past the edges of the screen. Otherwise, you'll get ink on the t-shirt outside the borders of the stencil.

, Carefully remove the screen and examine your work. Let the ink dry completely before using or laundering the t-shirt.

, When you remove the screen from the t-shirt, the paper stencil should be stuck to the paint on the screen. You can place this on a second t-shirt and apply more ink to replicate the design. Repeat with as many t-shirts as you like.

, Water-based screen printing ink dries quickly, and it's difficult to remove once it's dry. Wash it thoroughly in warm water when you're finished using it.

, Use design software to create a graphic design to print on your t-shirt. You could choose a photo or picture you found online or create graphic art. The great thing about using an iron-on transfer is that there's no need to feel limited by the amount of colors you can use.

, Feed the paper into your printer so that the design will print onto the side of the paper that will transfer it to the t-shirt.

, Smooth it out to remove any wrinkles or folds. Place the iron-on transfer design-side down on the t-shirt. Place a thin cloth, such as a dishcloth, over the transfer.

, Place a hot iron over the cloth so that it heats the transfer underneath. Hold it there for the amount of time recommended on the iron-on transfer instructions.

, Remove the cloth and use your fingers to gently lift the paper transfer backing. It should easily fall away from the t-shirt, leaving the transferred image behind. If you have trouble lifting it, press it down and use the iron to heat it once more, then try again.

Cut or saw the arrow shape out of the chosen material.,
Add the glitter.,
Apply a sealant or protective glue layer.",How to Make a Glitter Arrow for a Path2," Place the paper pattern down on the material and either pin or tape into place.


For wood, use a jigsaw, bandsaw or other suitable cutting tool to cut the shape out. If you're not good at doing this, ask someone who is to do it for you––it won't take them long to do this simple shape.
For cardboard, use paper-suitable scissors and simply cut around the pattern piece.

, Cover the work surface, as glitter will go everywhere! The application of the glitter will depend on the type of glitter you're using and the surface you've used for the base.


It is recommended that you use large glitter, the glitter that looks more like confetti. The effect needs to be very obvious and bright.
For a wooden surface: Apply wood glue and shake the glitter over the top.
For a cardboard surface: Apply paper glue and shake the glitter over the top.

, Spray a sealant or protective glue over the entire finished arrow. This will help keep the arrow' glittery surface intact and will allow the glitter to cope with light rain or dew. Spray several layers of sealant, allowing to dry between each spray (and follow the manufacturer's instructions for spraying it).

"
"
Place the arrow on the ground where it is likely to be seen.",How to Make a Glitter Arrow for a Path3," If the arrow is heavy enough, it won't need attaching or pinning to the ground.


For concrete/brick and other smooth surfaces: If the arrow might blow away, use poster tack or strong tape (such as duct tape) looped into sticky double-sided tabs to stick the arrow to the ground. If you're sticking it down, make sure the ground is clean first.
For rough, gravely surfaces: You won't be able to stick the arrow down. Either use the wooden arrow for weight or use small weights like pebbles to hold the arrow down at the edges. You could even carefully align an entire edging of small smooth river pebbles to keep the arrow weighted down.
For soil: Drive small pins or nails through the cardboard sign and into the soil to hold in place.

Attach tissue paper to printer paper.,
Print the picture out.,
Trim the picture to size.,
Place the picture on the candle.,
Wrap wax paper around the candle.,
Heat the entire structure.,
Peel away the wax paper.",How to Transfer Pictures to Candles1," Line the edges of a sheet of printer paper with glue, then press a sheet of tissue paper directly on top. Let dry.Use a glue stick or a very light, thin line of glue. Tape could also work.
The tissue paper needs to stick firmly to the printer paper, but if the glue is too thick, your printer may not be able to feed it through properly.;
, Place the tissue paper structure in your printer, then print out the picture you want to use. Make sure that the picture prints onto the tissue paper, not the regular paper.


You also need to make sure that the picture is sized accordingly before you print it. Resize the picture using a photo editing or word processing program so that it will fit onto the candle without difficulty.
Set the printer paper properties to a ""transparency film"" setting for best results.

, Use scissors to cut away as much excess paper from around the border of the picture as possible.


During this step, the tissue paper should also be freed from the computer paper. Dispose of or recycle the printer paper. Keep only the inked tissue paper for this project.
Some border can be helpful since it makes the picture easier to hold and maneuver, but this border should still be as thin as possible.

, Press the picture against the side of the candle at the position you want it.


Usually, there will be enough static to help hold the tissue paper in place. If the picture does not stay still on its own, however, you can apply a very small dab of glue to the corners before pressing it onto the candle.
The picture should be ink-side out when you place it on the candle.

, Wrap a sheet of wax paper around the candle. Keep it flush against the sides of the candle, and hold it in place from the back (the side opposite the picture).The wax paper makes it easier to maintain the shape of the candle. It also protects your hands from high, direct heat.
Make sure that the waxed side of the wax paper faces toward the candle.

, Use a handheld embossing tool or heat gun to blow hot air onto the picture for several minutes. When the ink starts to show through the wax paper more clearly, turn off the heat.Keep the heat gun moving so that the entire image transfers onto the candle evenly.
The wax on the wax paper should melt, sandwiching the image in between the wax of the candle and the melted wax of the wax paper.
If you do not have a heat gun or embossing tool, use a strong hair dryer or carefully hold the picture-side of the candle over the hot eye of a stove.

, Carefully peel away the wax paper from the candle. If done right, the image should remain on the candle.


If there are any pieces of wax sticking up afterward, wait until they cool and lightly pat them down or wipe them away.
This completes the project.

You could also use a picture from a magazine, piece of wrapping paper, or similar source. The material the paper is printed on should be no thicker than standard printer paper, however.

, Use scissors to cut around the picture, leaving as thin and narrow a border as possible.

, Place the picture face-down and use a glue stick to apply glue to the back.


You could apply a thin bead of tacky glue or other craft glue, but make sure that the bead is thin enough to prevent it from wrinkling the paper or showing through from the front.

, Position the picture over the candle, then press the glue-covered side of the image onto the candle.


Stick the center of the picture on first, then gradually rub out toward the edges with your fingers or cloth rag.
Firmly rub out any air bubbles you see, as well.

, Melt enough clear or white candle wax in a double boiler to cover at least half the height of your current candle.


Fill the bottom half of the double boiler with 2 inches (5 cm) of water and let it reach a boil over medium-high heat.
Place the wax inside the top half of the double boiler. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and let the wax melt slowly.
When ready, the over-dipping wax will reach a temperature of about 217 degrees Fahrenheit (103 degrees Celsius). This temperature may vary depending on the type of wax used, however.

, Grab one end of the candle and quickly dip the other half in the melted wax.Work carefully. Use tongs or gloves to protect your hands from the hot wax.
Only leave the candle in the wax for a few seconds.
Wait one minute after dunking the first half before continuing further.

, Once the first dipped half is cool enough to touch, lightly grab onto it. Quickly dunk the uncovered half of the candle in the hot, melted wax, as well.


As before, you should protect your hands and only keep the candle submerged for a few seconds.

, Place the candle on a dry, cool surface and let the wax coating harden.


Slice off any thick drips of wax with a craft knife once the candle has cooled.

Consider adjusting the contrast of your photograph before printing or copying it. Make the contrast as high as possible without damaging the quality of the image.

,, Remove the backing from the contact paper, revealing the adhesive side. Carefully place this adhesive side onto the image.


Make sure that the inked side of the image faces the adhesive as you press the two pieces together.
If there is excess contact adhesive, press it onto plain white paper. Doing so will make it easier to work with.
Firmly rub the contact paper onto the image, making sure that all of the inked parts of the picture are firmly stuck to the contact paper. Work from the paper side instead of the plastic contact paper side for best results.

, Cut away any excess paper using a pair of scissors.


For best results, make sure that there is enough contact paper to completely wrap around the outside of the candle holder.

, Fill a sink or plastic tub with warm water and submerge the picture in it. Let the picture soak for 7 minutes or more.


The paper and contact paper will both appear very soggy when done.

, Take the picture out of the water and gently roll your thumb over the soggy paper side of the picture, peeling away the paper and leaving only inked plastic behind.


Work under running water for best results.
Note that some of the paper may fall off on its own due to the moisture.
The image should have completely transferred itself onto the plastic portion of the contact paper. If you rub the image too forcefully, however, you could cause some of the ink to smear or wipe off.

, Place the plastic strip on a dry surface, like a table or counter, and let the entire thing air dry completely.


The ink side should face up as the strip dries. Even though the ink will not seem sticky when the contact paper is wet, it will become sticky again once the contact paper dries.
Note that you may also see a few dots of paper after the strip dries. If this happens, rub these bits of paper off under running water, then let the strip dry again.

, Place the contact paper strip around the outside of a clear glass candle votive, pressing it firmly into place.


Keep the inked, sticky side of the contact paper toward the glass. This adhesive should be all you need to hold the strip in place.
Use your thumb to smooth out any bubbles or creases. Keep the strip as straight and flat as possible as you adhere it to the glass.

, Place a candle inside the decorated candle holder and light it. The picture on the outside of the glass should be beautifully illuminated.


This step successfully completes the entire process.

You should be able to make 10-14 seals with a 3/4"" embossing coin from one stick of standard sealing wax candles.,
Light the wick and hold the wax stick at a slight 20 degree angle (lit end down).

,
Holding the stick directly on & over the area where you wish to make your seal, allow the melting wax to pull itself onto the project creating a pool large enough for the sealing coin.

,If you find the wax begins to set while you are still melting the wax, move the candle around the area to mix hot wax with the cooler wax.,
Emboss wax with your seal by pressing the coin into the wax, allow the wax to set, and lift seal straight up.

,
If you find the wax won't let go of the seal, simply let your seal rest on the wax until the wax is completely cool, then lift your seal off.

Fill a large pot with a little water.,
Boil the water.,
Set a second pot inside and lower the heat.,
Place the wax inside the smaller pot.,
Melt slowly.,
Use the wax as desired.",How to Melt Beeswax1," If you have a double boiler, fill the bottom half with 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water. If you do not have a double boiler, choose any old, large saucepan and fill it with 1 or 2 inches (2.5 or 5 cm) of water, instead.


The pot should be large enough for a second, smaller pot or metal bowl to sit inside.
Never expose beeswax directly to the heat source. Doing so can cause the wax to melt unevenly and may result in scorching or fires.
Since water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), using a double boiler also makes it difficult for the wax to exceed this temperature, making the process much safer.;
, Place the large saucepan on the stove and heat it on high until the water reaches a steady, rolling boil.


Do not keep the pot on the outer edge of the stove. Hot wax is dangerous, so to prevent it from accidentally getting knocked over, keep the pots on one of the inside eyes of the stove.
Use an electric stove or hot plate when possible. Gas stoves are usually safe, but if your wax does manage to reach its flash point, the vapors may find the gas flame of your stove and ignite.

, Place the top half of your double boiler inside the bottom half. If you are not using a double boiler, simply use a smaller metal pot or bowl. Lower the heat so that the water reduces to a gentle simmer.


Only use a metal bowl. Do not use plastic or glass.
Ideally, the top half should rest on the lip of the bottom half so that the bottom of the top half does not touch the bottom of the lower half.
If your top half does have to rest on the bottom of the lower half, place a metal cookie cutter or similar metal utensil inside the bottom of the lower half and set the upper bowl on top of the cookie cutter. The cookie cutter elevates the bowl enough to protect it from the heat source., Carefully lower the block of beeswax into the upper bowl or pot. Make sure that no water can get inside the bowl containing the wax.


To speed up the process, consider cutting the wax into smaller chunks before placing it in the double boiler. Smaller pieces of wax melt faster than larger blocks.

, Allow the block of beeswax to melt slowly. Depending on how large your pieces of wax are, this could take anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours.


Never leave the wax unattended as it melts.
Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of your beeswax as it melts. Beeswax should melt around 145 to 147 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 64 degrees Celsius). Do not allow it to exceed temperatures beyond 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (71 to 77 degrees Celsius), since beeswax can take on a dark hue and lose its aroma past this point.Add water to the lower pan periodically as the original water starts to evaporate away. Do not allow the double boiler to become completely dry at any point during the process.

, Once the wax melts down, you can use it in molds or as otherwise called for.

"
"
Find or make a mold.,
Place a candle wick into the mold, sticking straight up.,
Break the crayons into pieces.,
Melt the crayons around the candle wick.,
Let the crayon-candle cool.,
Remove the candle from the mold.",How to Use Crayons in Crafts1," You can use a milk carton, a lined muffin tin, or a small Pyrex bowl.;
, Tie one end to a wooden skewer or toothpick and rest the skewer across the top of the open mold to keep the wick upright.

, Remove the paper cover first; break them by hand, or you can put them into a plastic bag and step on them.

, You can choose one of three methods given below to melt the crayons.


Fill the mold with broken pieces of crayon, placing pieces around the wick, and place the mold in an oven at 250 degrees Fahrenheit (just hot enough to melt the crayons), until the crayons melt together (keep watching it!)






Place the crayon pieces in a small metal bowl, or a clean, opened tin, and place the tin into a pot of boiling water until the crayons melt, then pour the melted crayons into the mold.






Put the crayon pieces into an oven roasting bag, place bag into a heated oven or boiling water until crayons are melted. Then pour the crayon wax into the mold.







, Wait about 30 minutes.

, If you are using a muffin tin, turn it upside-down and tap the bottom gently.

Assemble a double boiler or bain marie.,
Peel the wrappers off of the crayons.,
Consider separating the crayons by color.,
Cut the crayons into smaller pieces using a craft knife or a kitchen knife.,
Turn on the stove and bring the water to a boil.,
Drop the crayon pieces into the glass container.,
Wait until the crayons are melted.,
Take the container out of the water and use the wax.",How to Melt Crayons1," Fill a large pot with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water. Place a heat-safe glass container inside the large pot. The top of the glass container should be above the water level.









If you have a metal beaker used for candle-making, you can use this instead of the glass container.;
, If you don't remove the wrapper, you will end up with a soggy mess. Here are a few easy ways to remove crayon wrappers:









Peel and tear the wrapper off. Start at one end (top or bottom) and the seam of the wrapper. Nick your fingernail under the wrapper, and start tearing it off.
If the wrappers are difficult to remove, run a craft knife down the length of a crayon and gently cut the wrapper open. Peel the wrapper off.Soak the crayon in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. The water will soften the paper and make it easier to remove.Some crayons have very loose wrappers that are not glued on. You might be able to slide these off like a sock or a paper wrapper off a straw.

, If you have a bunch of crayons in different colors, you can sort them by color. This will save you time later when you are melting the crayons. You do not have to group specific colors together, such as putting all of the ""periwinkle"" blues together and the ""royal"" blues together. Instead, just group all of the blues together, all of the yellows together, and so forth.








, You want the pieces to be about ½ inches (1.27 centimeters) long.This will help them melt quicker and reduce the number of lumps that might form.








, Once the water starts boiling, lower the temperature and keep the water at a steady simmer.








, Do not put all of the colors in all at once, or you will get a murky brown color. Instead, drop the crayons in based on color. If you sorted the colors out beforehand, you can just drop the color piles into the container.









If you are making crayon candles, then add some shaved candle wax and a few drops of essential oil or candle fragrance.If you are making crayon-based lipstick, then you will need to start with one crayon (you can use one color, or different colors amounting to one crayon) and ½ teaspoon of shea butter, and ½ teaspoon of oil, such as almond oil, Argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil.If you want to add any extras, such as glitter, fragrance, or essential oil, now is the time to do so.

, Stir them occasionally with a spoon so that everything gets heated evenly. Do not leave the stove unattended and be sure to use good ventilation; the fumes given off by the melting wax can cause headaches.








If the water level in the big pot starts to get too low, add more water.

, The glass container will be very hot, so be sure to use an oven mitt or pot holder to protect your hand. You can pour the hot wax into silicone ice cube molds or candy molds to make fun-shaped crayons. You can also use this wax to make crayon-based lipstick or candles.

Decide which pieces of your clothing need major design improvement.,
Protect the clothing item.",How to Potato Print Clothing1," Typical items of clothing that work well for potato printing include caps, socks, tights, t-shirts and canvas shoes. You can probably find other clothes to work with too.;
, If the clothing item is a sock, sleeve or leg, it'll need to be protected from the paint printing through to the unprinted side. To do this:


Draw and cut out a cardboard template the same shape as the item you're seeking to protect.
Slip the template inside the sock, sleeve or leg to provide a suitable barrier.

Design your print.,
Use a craft knife to cut out all the coloured parts of your design.,
Put your stencil on top of your material (paper or t-shirt) and the screen on top of the stencil.,
Spoon out some paint.,
Use the squeegee to spread the paint over the mesh.,
Lift everything up off your material.",How to Make a Screen Print1," Think of something interesting and draw it on to a piece of paper. Don't worry about coloring or shading it -- you'll be cutting it out and using the rest of it as a stencil.









Keep it simple at first. Geometrical shapes and circles in an uneven pattern are easiest and never cliché. Space them far enough apart if you're a beginner -- you don't want the paper to tear when being cut.;
, Keep the surrounding blank paper in tact. You have now made your stencil. Unfortunately, if it rips, you'll probably need to start over. Exercise care and precision.









Make sure your stencil fits appropriately on your shirt. If it doesn't, you'll have to resize or otherwise adjust it.

, Place the stencil so the mesh is directly on top (the two should be touching) and the handles are facing up. If there is space between the edges of your stencil and the edges of your screen, put masking tape on the underside. You don't want paint leaking where it shouldn't leak.









If you use the taping method, make sure not to tape the stencil to the mesh! Otherwise the stencil might move around when you're squeegee-ing it.

, Make a line at the top of the screen (the part furthest away from you). You don't want paint on top of the stencil at the moment. Try to spoon out as much paint as you think would cover the stencil.









It's a little difficult to use more than one color with this method. If you do try it, know that at some point or other, the colors will mix. If you're okay with that, go for it!

, Try to do it with one downwards movement -- or the least number of strokes possible. This makes it look as smooth and professional as can be.









Always, always, always, make vertical strokes. If you make both horizontal and vertical strokes, the paint will clump and be harder to dry and finish.
Once you reach the bottom, keep going and scoop the excess paint up the handle to be reused.

, Be careful! If you drag it at all, the paint may smear. It's best to do it layer by layer, lifting up and then off.









Leave to dry. The longer, the better.

If you printed onto clothing, then once it is dry you need to put a sheet of greasing or tracing paper over your design and iron it. This seals it, making it wearable and washable.

Pour water into a slow cooker.,
Place a small bowl inside the slow cooker.,
Sit the beeswax inside the bowl.,
Cook until melted.,
Use as needed.",How to Melt Beeswax2," Fill the basin of a slow cooker with 2 inches (5 cm) of water.


If you want to speed the process up a bit, heat the water in a kettle before pouring it into the slow cooker.A slow cooker is even safer than the double boiler method since the temperature of the heat is so low.
Technically, you can melt the beeswax directly in the basin of the slow cooker without creating a water bath since the temperatures remain so low. If you choose to do this, make sure that the slow cooker basin made from a nonstick material.
Using the water bath is generally preferred, however, since it further protects the wax from direct heat. The water bath also makes it easier to pour and use the wax after it melts.

, Sit a small metal bowl inside the water-filled basin of your slow cooker. Make sure that the water in your slow cooker cannot get into this metal bowl.


Use a metal bowl. Do not use plastic or glass dishes.
For this method, it works best if the metal bowl sits directly on the bottom of the slow cooker basin instead of resting above the surface of the water.
Make sure that the lid of the slow cooker can still fit on top of the device once you place the bowl inside. If the lid cannot fit on the slow cooker, use a different bowl.

, Place the block of beeswax in the metal bowl resting inside the slow cooker.


Consider breaking the beeswax into smaller chunks instead of placing the entire block inside. Beeswax melts slowly, especially when prepared in a slow cooker water bath. Using smaller pieces will help speed the melting process up in a safe way.

, Cover the slow cooker and switch the heat on to high. Allow the beeswax to sit in the hot slow cooker for several hours until it melts.


You can also melt the beeswax using the low setting of your slow cooker, but doing so will take more time.
Make sure that you keep the slow cooker covered during this time.
Monitor the temperature the beeswax using a cooking thermometer. Beeswax melts around 145 to 147 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 64 degrees Celsius). Do not allow the temperature to exceed 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (71 to 77 degrees Celsius), since beeswax can begin to discolor past this point.

, Once the wax has finished melting, you can use it in molds and other projects.


If you cannot use all of the melted wax immediately, you can keep it warm and melted by removing the lid and switching the slow cooker to its ""warm"" setting.

Line a Styrofoam chest with foil.,
Place the wax in the chest.,
Sit the chest in a sunny location.,
Melt the wax slowly.,
Use as desired.",How to Melt Beeswax3," Cover the sides and bottom of a small styrofoam cool chest with aluminum foil.The aluminum foil will reflect the sunlight, allowing the chest to heat up enough to melt the wax.
Opt for a styrofoam cooler or cooling chest instead of a plastic cooler or other container. The styrofoam acts as insulation, so the heat remains primarily on the inside instead of seeping out through the sides of the chest.
Solar heat is both ""green"" and safe. The inside of the cooler should get hot enough under the right conditions, but the heat is usually gentle enough to prevent the wax from scorching or catching on fire.

, Sit the block of beeswax in your foil-coated cooler. Place a sheet of glass or clear acrylic on top of the cooler and secure it in place with duct tape.


If you want to speed the process up, consider cutting or breaking the block of wax into smaller pieces. Smaller chunks of wax will melt down much faster than larger blocks.

, Place the chest in direct sunlight, using the warmest spot possible. Keep it away from moisture and shade.


This process will work best on a warm, sunny day. Avoid using it on a cloudy or rainy day or in the evening.
If you are using this process to melt beeswax in a cooler season, keep the container inside and choose the warmest location possible. During warmer seasons, you can keep the chest inside or outside.

, Give the wax a few hours to melt. Check on its progress every 20 to 30 minutes.


Never leave melting wax completely unattended for more than a few minutes at a time.
Get an early start. Starting the process in the morning or early afternoon will give the wax plenty of time to melt inside the heating chamber.
Consider monitoring the temperature of the heating chamber by placing an oven thermometer inside. Beeswax melts around 145 to 147 degrees Fahrenheit (63 to 64 degrees Celsius). Do not allow the temperature to exceed 160 to 170 degrees Fahrenheit (71 to 77 degrees Celsius), since beeswax can begin to discolor past this point.

, Once the wax melts down, you can use it in any project calling for melted beeswax.

Place the containers into the microwave.,
Microwave the crayons for 2 minutes, pausing every 30 seconds to stir.,
Use the melted wax.",How to Melt Crayons2," If you don't remove the wrappers, the wax may melt into them and create a greasy, waxy mess. Here are a few simple ways to remove crayon wrappers:









Peel and tear the wrapper off.
Score the paper wrapper with a craft knife and peel the wrapper open.
Soak the crayons in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes to loosen the wrapper, then peel the wrapper off.
Some crayons have very loose wrappers. You might be able to simply slide these off.

, If you have a bunch of crayons, you can sort them into similar colors. This means that you put all of the pinks together and all of the purples together. You don't have to focus on grouping specific colors together, such as putting all of the ""bubblegum"" pinks together and all of the ""rose"" pinks together.








, You want the pieces to be about ½ inches (1.27 centimeters) long. This will help reduce the melting time.








, You can use a glass jar or even an old coffee mug. If you have multiple colors, then put each color group into a separate container.









If you wish to make candles out of crayons, then use one part shaved candle wax to one part crayon.You can also add a few drops of essential oil or candle-making fragrance.
If you are making lipstick, then you will need one crayon (you can use one color, or different colors amounting to one crayon) and ½ teaspoon of shea butter, and ½ teaspoon of oil, such as almond oil, Argan oil, coconut oil, jojoba oil, or olive oil.

, You can put multiple colors/containers into the microwave at one time, but don't overcrowd the microwave oven. It is better to heat each color one at a time, or heat in small batches.








, Do not step away from the microwave; keep an eye on the melting crayons. Each microwave is different, and your crayons may melt sooner.








, Once the crayons are completely melted, you may pour the wax into silicone molds or plastic candy molds to make fun-shaped crayons. You can also use the wax to make crayon-based lipstick and candles.









If you want to add any extras, such as glitter, fragrance, or essential oil, do so now. Be sure to stir it in well. Don't add the glitter earlier; it might react with the microwave.

Place the crayon pieces into the molds.,
Place the tin in the oven and bake it for 10 to 15 minutes.,
Remove the tin from the oven.,
Remove the hardened crayons from the molds.",How to Melt Crayons3," In this method, you will be melting some old crayons into fun new shapes.








, Most crayons have wrappers that are easy to peel off. Some might even slide off on their own. If you are having troubles removing the wrappers, here are a few tips:









Run a craft knife down the length of a crayon, gently slicing the paper wrapper open. Be careful not to cut the actual crayon. You should be able to pull the wrapper off easily.
If the wrappers are difficult to remove, soak the entire crayon in a bowl of hot water for a few minutes. The water will help soften the paper, making it easier to remove.

, If you are using a lot of crayons, you can save time later by sorting them into similar colors. This means that you put the yellows with the yellows and the blues with the blues. You do not have to group specific colors together, such as putting all of the ""cornflower"" blues together and the ""goldenrod"" yellows together.








, You want the pieces to be about ½ inches (1.27 centimeters) long. This will help them melt quicker and reduce the number of lumps that might form.








, You can use an old cupcake or muffin tin, or you can use a silicone baking or ice cube mold. Silicone has a very high melting point, so it is safe to use in the oven.









If you are using a cupcake or muffin tin, consider lightly greasing the wells with cooking spray or shortening. This will prevent any sticking. You can also line the wells with cupcake liners instead.
If you are using a silicone mold, you do not need to line it or grease it. The mold is stick-resistant and flexible, so the melted crayons (once hardened) will easily ""pop"" out.

, If you plan on making fun-shaped crayons, then you will want to over-fill each well a little bit. This is because the crayons will spread out and fill in the gaps when they melt.









Consider matching colors to the shape. For example, if your mold has different shapes, such as stars and hearts, put the reds and pinks in the heart-shaped well, and the yellows and blues in the star-shaped well.
Consider mixing and matching some colors. Try putting reds, oranges, and yellows into one shape, blues and greens into another, and pinks and purples into a third.

, If you are using silicone mold, place it onto a baking sheet first.








, Once the crayons have completely melted, pull the tin out of the oven. You can now use the melted wax for your project, or you can let the wax cool and harden in the mold to make fun-shaped crayons.









If you are making fun-shaped crayons, you can speed up the cooling process by waiting until the wax hardens a bit, then sticking the molds into the freezer for 30 minutes., If you are making fun-shaped crayons, wait for the wax to harden completely. You can tell if the wax has set if the bottom of the mold or tin is cool to the touch. Once the wax has set, turn the mold upside down. If you are using cupcake or muffin tins, the crayons should pop right out. If they don't, you can lightly tap the tray against the counter. If you are using a silicone mold, gently grip the edges of the mold, and press down on the bulging shape, pushing the crayon out.

Print off your design on your computer.,
Place your sheer fabric material in an embroidery hoop.,
Place the hoop on top of the pattern and start tracing.,
Flip the hoop fabric side up.,
Position the screen in place.,
Pull off the screen and allow your material to dry.",How to Make a Screen Print2," A big, dark, simple design is easiest to work with. Print in black and white or dark colors -- you need to see the pattern through the screen. It also has to fit inside your embroidery hoop.


If you don't want to use your computer's imaging program, you can draw one yourself. Just make sure it's the right size, is dark enough, and won't transfer to your screen.

, Unscrew the hoop that opens it and pull your fabric taut across the base of the hoop. Replace the top and twist the screw back in. It doesn't matter if it's centered; you'll only be using the material within the circumference of the hoop.









Sheer curtain material works well as your screen. Pick a fabric that's meshy and not quite translucent.

, The fabric should be directly touching the pattern. Use a pencil to trace your image; if you mess up, you can always go back and erase. Only trace an outline.








, Cover the outside of your pattern (where your tracing lines are) in a layer of glue. This should not be on your pattern; it should be surrounding it. This glue acts as a shield when you apply the paint -- if you go outside the lines, it won't show on the fabric; it'll just be left on the glue.









The glue can go as crazy as it wants outside the pattern -- just make sure it doesn't go inside. When you're finished, wait for it to dry completely. 15 minutes should do the trick.

, The sheer fabric should be away from the material, separated by the width of the embroidery hoop. Smooth out the fabric underneath the screen to create an even pattern.









If you have an ink squeegee, use it to apply your paint to the material. If you don't, use a sponge paintbrush and hold the screen firmly.

, Be careful that you don't incur any smudges when you lift it off! If it hasn't dried thoroughly, the paint may run. Give it a solid 15 minutes to dry completely.









Iron your fabric, following the directions on the bottle of ink or paint you used. Wear away!

Consider filling in the background, if desired, using a contrasting color.This will make your work stand out.,
Set the mosaic out to dry.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Paper Mosaic1," You just need the outline, so don't shade in the picture. This will be the outline for your mosaic, so the simpler the image is, the better. Great examples include: stars, moons, hearts, and flowers.


Construction paper or printer paper will work just fine, but you can also use cardstock or thin cardboard for something sturdier.;
, Construction paper is the most popular, but you can also use scrapbook paper, paint chips, magazine pages, or even cereal boxes! What colors you need depends on your design. You don't have to use all of the colors of the rainbow. You could just use different shades of the same color, such as: light blue, medium blue, and dark blue.

, The pieces should be small, about the size of your thumbnail. You can make squares, rectangles, triangles, or even thin strips. The pieces don't have to be the same size. In fact, try to cut some smaller ones too. This way, you can fit them into tight corners.


Sort your shapes by color and put them into small piles or cups. This will make it easier to find the color you need., Leave a small gap between each one. You can apply the glue directly to the sheet of paper, or you can apply it to the back of your tile instead. If you are using irregular shapes, including triangles, make sure that the straightest edge is on the outside of the outline—otherwise, your shape will look jagged.


If you are using white school glue, apply it with a paintbrush. This will keep things less messy.If you are applying the glue directly to the paper, work only in small sections at a time, or the glue will dry too fast., If your shape has designs on the inside, like spots on a butterfly wing, outline those designs first with more tiles before filling them in.


Don't be afraid to cut some pieces down to help them fit!
For a more professional touch, continue aligning the pieces along the outline, going smaller and smaller with each row until you reach the center.

, If you used different colors for your shape (this includes different shades of the same color), consider using just one color for the background. This will make your shape the focus.


You can also leave the background blank.

, If you'd like to make your mosaic last longer, coat it with an acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Let it dry before moving on.,"

Draw a large oval or rectangle on a sheet of black paper.,
Draw some shapes for the eyes, nose, and mouth.,
Cut some colored paper into small tiles.,
Start gluing your paper tiles to the edge of your mask.,
Glue some more tiles to the inside edges of the nose and mouth.,
Outline the outside of the eyes with more tiles, if desired.,
Start filling in your mask with tiles.,
Let your mask dry.,
Cut the mask and the eyes out.,
Punch some holes to either side of the mask, and thread some ribbon or elastic through them.",How to Make a Paper Mosaic2," The shape needs to be just a little bit larger than your head. Don't cut anything out yet.Use poster paper, construction paper, or cardstock for this.

, You will be cutting the eyes out, so figure out where your eyes will be when you put the mask on, and place them accordingly. Keep the nose and moth simple; you will be filling them in with tiles. A triangle for the nose and a rectangle or sausage shape for the mouth would be perfect!

, You can use construction paper, scrapbook paper, or paint chips for this. The shapes can be squares, rectangles, triangles, or even a combination of all three. They can be different sizes, but try to make them no larger than your thumbnail.


You will need at least two different colors for this: one color for the mask and a contrasting color for the nose and mouth.
For a different look, paint your own paper, let it dry, then cut it out.Sort your shapes by color. This will make it easier to find the color you need.

, Leave a small gap between each tile, and make sure that it doesn't go past the edges of the paper shape. You can use a glue stick or white school glue. If you are using white school glue, apply it using a paint brush. This will make things less messy.

, This way, your nose and mouth won't be too big. Remember to leave a slight gap between each tile. For a cleaner finish, align any straight edges with the outline, and keep pointy edges on the inside of the shape.


Use your contrasting color(s) for this. It will help them stand out better.

, Don't fill the eyes in. You will be cutting them out later. You can use the same color you will use for the inside of the mask, or you can use a contrasting color.

, You can glue them down randomly, or you can follow the curves of the outlines as you work your way towards the center. Remember to leave slight gaps between each tile.


Use your contrasting color for the nose and mouth.

, If you'd like to make your mask last longer, you can seal it with a clear, acrylic sealer or a brush-on decoupage glue, such as Mod Podge. Remember to let the mask dry after sealing it.

, If you are a child, ask an adult to help you cut the eyes out. You can cut the mask itself out using a pair of scissors, but you will need a shape craft knife (such as an Xacto knife) to cut the eyes out.

, The holes should be at about ear level, or just where the eyes are on your mask. This will make the mask more comfortable to wear.

Select the lentils or dried beans you would like to form the mosaic.,
Decide on which surface you will present your mosaic.,
Decide which design will you will use for making the mosaic.,
Place the rough draft of your drawing beside where you're going to prepare the canvas for the mosaic.,
Apply the lentils/beans to the mosaic background.,
Repeat.,
Seal the design.,
Done.",How to Make a Mosaic with Lentils," You can stick to one kind or both, and it is a good idea to vary the colors if possible. For example, lentils come in a range of colors, including browns, blacks, yellows and oranges. Beans come in different shades and patterns too.


Keep the size differences in mind. Placing too large a bean or lentil next to a much smaller one may not be the look you're after in the mosaic design. Think about how you want the general design to be in terms of sizes before selecting the lentils and/or beans.;
, It can be a canvas, a tile, a CD case or a wooden board. A canvas tends to look more professional for a wall hanging but it's really up to you and the end purpose to which you'll be putting the mosaic.

, The design can be sourced from your imagination or from the internet (check art sites such as DeviantArt or Etsy and image sites such as Pinterest or Flickr for inspiration). Some design examples to help you include:


Abstract: Randomly placed lentils/beans, perhaps varying in colors and sizes. Abstract is likely to be the easiest choice for the beginner mosaic maker.
A landscape: Use the colors and shapes of the lentils/beans to depict trees, flowers, fields, the sky, people and animals, etc.
A portrait: Choose a famous person or a family member to replicate in a lentil/bean mosaic.
A tracing: For example, trace around a hand, a foot or an object that you like the shape of.
Make a rough draft of your drawing first so that you can have an idea of certain features, such as placement and defining of specific objects.

, Transfer your final design onto the chosen canvas, outlining the areas clearly. Do not draw anything too small to add the lentils/beans to––keep the size of your mosaic objects in mind as you draw.

, Follow the design and the color scheme you've chosen. Apply the liquid glue to a small area, then sprinkle the lentils/beans over the glue. After few seconds, press gently on the lentils to help them to adhere firmly to the canvas.

, Continue working in sections, adding glue, then the mosaic items, until the drawing is filled.

, In order for the mosaic to last a long time, spray varnish across it. This will also give it a glossy and firm look, which provides for a pleasant presentation.

, Hang or display the mosaic for your family to see.

Spray sealer to seal the grout.",How to Make a Mosaic Table Top," Secure the paper around the table's edges with tape. If your paper is not wide enough, tape two pieces together so that it can fit over the entire table. , Use scissors to cut around the edge of the table. The tape should hold the paper in place as you cut. Once you're done, remove the remaining tape and butcher paper from the tabletop. It should be the same dimensions as your tabletop.

, If you want a more artistic look, you can create different shaped tiles yourself. Place your tiles flat on the floor and cover them with a towel. Then use a hammer and smash the tiles into different pieces carefully. When you lift up the towel, the tiles should be in different shapes and sizes.You can also just purchase smaller tiles from the store.
Consider using premade ceramic tiles, glass tiles, glass gems, or a mirror to cover your table top.

, Lay the paper out on a different flat surface, like the floor. Collect the tiles that you plan on using for your mosaic and lay them out on the paper. This will help you visualize what they will look like before you commit them to your table. It will also help you keep your tiles organized as you continue to construct your mosaic.If you are using uniform sized pieces for your mosaic, remember to leave gaps in between the tiles so that grout can fit in between them.
Experiment with creating unique designs. If you don't like how your design looks, you can rearrange the tiles on the paper before you start constructing your table.

, If the table top is made of wood, you'll want to make sure that you have a smooth surface to place your mosaic tiles. Use a hand or belt sander to sand down any rough edges or bulges in the wood. If your table top is made of another material like granite or metal, you can skip this step.


Use 150-grit on coarse-grain woods like oak or walnut and 180-grit on fine-grain woods like cherry or maple., Use a duster or a dry cloth to run over the surface of the table and remove any dust that you created from sanding. Make sure to go over the surface of the table with your hand to make sure that there aren't any places that you missed with the sander.


If there are places that you missed with the sander, go back and resand the area., Use a damp cloth and a traditional mild dish soap and go over the surface of your table. Once the table top is clean, you can start creating your mosaic.

, Use a roller or a brush to apply a coating of paint over the surface of the table. You can purchase a latex semi-gloss paint made specifically for furniture at a paint or hardware store. The first coat of your paint will most likely not be dark enough, so you may have to apply multiple coats. Once you've painted the table, allow it to dry overnight.Painting the table is important if you plan on using translucent tiles or stones and don't want the table's natural color to come through the mosaic.

, Be sure to mix the sealer well before using it. Apply a coat of oil or water-based polyurethane sealer with a clean brush. Remember to read the instructions when using a sealer or stain. The sealer will prevent water damage. Seal your table in a well-ventilated area.

, Using the tiles from the butcher paper, dab one side of the tiles that you plan on using and press it hard into the surface of the table. Work from the outside in when gluing down your design. Once you're done gluing down the tiles, allow the tiles to set overnight.If you decide that you want to change the design of the mosaic, make sure that you move the tiles around before the glue fully dries.
The best glue to use for ceramic or glass tiles are mortar, mastic, or tile adhesive. You can purchase these at most home improvement stores., Combine the grout powder with water in a bucket and use a trowel to mix the grout until it forms a thick consistency. Make sure to read the instructions on the grout to get the exact measurement of water that you need.


Make sure there aren't any lumps in your grout before using it.

, The goal is to get the grout to go in between your tiles. This will add to the look of your mosaic table, make it flatter, and will help keep the tiles onto the table. Use the trowel and work the grout over the tiles. This will force some of the grout in between your tiles., Use a plastic card and run it over the surface of your tiles. Some grout will be left over after the scraping, but try to get as much of it as you can with the card., Let the grout set for at least 24-hours before cleaning it. Once it's dry, go over the surface of the tiles with dish soap and warm water. If the grout is not coming off, use a sponge to help scrub it. Once your mosaic table top looks shiny, wipe it down and dry it with a clean rag., Purchase a penetrating sealer that works with whatever material you used for your mosaic. Spray the sealer over the surface of the table and make sure to wipe down the tiles with a damp cloth to prevent a film from forming on the tiles themselves. Once the grout is saturated with the sealer, allow it to dry. Once the grout is dry, wash down your table one more time before using it.If the table is going outdoors or you'll be having meals at it, it's important to seal the grout to prevent mildew and stop the grout from getting soft when it comes into contact with water.

",How to Make Mosaic Art," Pieces of material used in mosaic art are called tesserae. They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or whatever else you can find. You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include. These could include buttons, bones, metals, etc.If you can, find them already precut into distinct shapes and sizes. This will keep you from having to break them with a hammer/saw later.
Choose a wide variety of colors and shades. Even if your work will be mostly monochromatic, you will want varying values and ones.
Choose tesserae that goes with the art you wish to create. For example, if you are doing a beach scene, it might be best to use a wide variety of shells. If you are looking to recreate the Brooklyn Bridge, you might want to look into metals.;
, Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use. You can make almost anything work as a base. Wood, terracotta and/or glass are usually what people use as a base. Make sure the base is strong enough to hold the weight of the tesserae and grout.Choose bases which have large, open spaces. If there are numerous crevices on your base, it may be hard to create mosaic pieces which will fit.

, Every base needs to be cleaned off before you adhere the mosaic tiles down, otherwise they will not stick properly. For most bases, you can simply use water and a basic home cleaner. Scrub the dirt and grim off, and then dry the surface off. Go back over the surface a few more times in case you missed something.For metal bases, use sandpaper and a wire brush in order to remove rust. The now ""roughed up"" surface has an added benefit, it will make the tiles stick to the surface better.
Score plastic and/or rubber surfaces with a utility knife in order to help the tiles stick better.
Sand wood surfaces down, then apply a waterproof sealer. If you don't do this, moisture could soak in, thereby cracking your mosaic art.

, Find patterns for free online or use your imagination and come up with your own design. For a first time project, you may wish to work with a simple pattern. This could mean a house, a fish, a landscape, or anything else with simply defined shapes. After you work on a simple pattern, you can graduate up to more complicated projects., Print out the pattern to the dimensions needed. Begin transferring the design, first using a pencil. This will allow you to adjust for mistakes and inconsistencies. Once you have a rough outline with a pencil, go back and trace over the lines with a pen or marker, depending on the type of base. If you are using a basic design, this might be the time to add in details that are not present in the original design.If the pattern is extra large, do it in sections. Remember this is a rough outline, which can be changed when you start to lay down specific tiles.
If you are using an original design, simply draw it directly onto the base. However, don't over plan. Spontaneity is key to creating artistically stunning art.

, In order to get the mosaic ""look"" you will need to create different shapes and sizes of pieces. Remember, before you begin to break your mosaic objects into pieces, you need to be wearing safety goggles, gloves, and an apron. Pick a safe place to cut your objects, like an empty garage, or outdoors in your backyard. If you are just looking to make randomly sized pieces, a basic hammer works best. However, there are some more specialized ways.Tile nippers and cutters are used to create straight lines and curves. They can be found at most hardware, and arts and crafts stores. These are used to cut through porcelain, ceramic, china, etc. Cut through the object you are using about halfway through. They, using your hands, break the piece off.
Glass nippers and cutters work the same way, except that they are specially designed for cutting glass.
When you are creating the pieces, look at your design. Try to envision what shapes you will need in order to fill the pattern. If you miss a piece, or mis-cut one, you can always come back later to cut a new one.

, Take each of your new pieces you have created and place them where you will eventually stick them. This is a great opportunity to mix around shapes, sizes and colors. Once you get a basic layout of your pieces, find where the missing pieces are, or where you need a better shaped piece. Then go back and create a new one which better fits the design.Once you have your objects laid out the way you want them, you then have two options: leave them there, or take them off.
If you choose to leave them there, you will apply mortar directly to the pieces. This garners a more accurate design, but takes a lot longer and can be more tricky.
If you choose to take them off, place the pieces to the side in the same pattern they were placed on the base. You will be applying mortar onto the base. This garners a less accurate pattern, but is much easier to accomplish.

, You can find mortar mixtures at most local hardware stores. You will want to mix together 2-3 cups of mortar mixture with an acrylic admix. Stir the mixture together until the consistency is like thick cottage cheese. Only mix together small amounts as you work, as the mortar mixture cannot be preserved., Depending on whether you have left the pattern on, or taken it off, will change whether you apply the mortar to the pieces or the base, respectively. Use a small knife or scalpel. When you are applying the mortar, wear gloves so that mortar does not stick to your hands. Mortar is basically a type of cement which can be difficult to get off.If you are applying the mixture to the base, only do one section at a time. Spread on a few inches, length wise, onto the base. You only need about a 1/4 inch width of mortar.
If you are applying it to the pieces themselves, take your knife and apply the mixture to the back of the piece. Try to keep most of the mortar adhered to the back by gently pressing the mixture with your hands. Scrape off excess mortar from around the outside edge of the piece before you apply it.

, While still wet, gently affix the mosaic tiles by pushing them down onto the base. Apply tiles starting in one corner of the design and work across in rows. Make sure you leave enough space between pieces for grout, about 1/8 inch gaps. Every time you lay down a new piece, scrape off any excess mortar which is readily apparent. If you don't, the mortar will solidify and be hard to get off., Time varies depending on usage, so follow manufacturer recommendations. For pieces in your home, the timing is roughly 24 hours. Outdoor mosaics will need to set for 72 hours. Clean the mosaic tiles once more to clear away any extra mortar that may have risen to the top., Combine together 2-3 cups of grout mixture with a bit of acrylic admix. Stir the combination until the consistency is that of thick cottage cheese. Grout comes in many colors and there are colors you can add to the grout to change the coloring. Choose a color that accents your mosaic., Fill in the creases between the tiles. The grout should cover the mosaic enough to fill the gaps. Work in small areas at a time and wipe off any excess grout as you go along. Each time you grout around a new piece, give the tesserae a gentle push to make sure the tile sticks to the grout.Make sure you are wearing gloves as you apply, otherwise the grout will stick and solidify on your hands.

, Wipe the mosaic with a clean sponge and warm water. Rinse out the sponge regularly as you wipe away grout from the surface of the tiles. After you are done cleaning, let the water sit in the bucket for a while. The grout will sink to the bottom. You can then pour out the water, and dump the grout into a trashcan., This will coat the tiles and safeguard against damage, especially for outdoor mosaics subjected to fluctuating temperatures and adverse weather conditions. It also will give a high gloss shine that will make the colors stand out. Tile and stone-floor sealers can be purchased at most local hardware stores.You will want to apply two coats. Use a paintbrush to apply each coat. In between coats, wait about 10-15 minutes for the varnish to dry.
After the sealer has dried, buff the mosaic with a soft towel. This will give your mosaic a nice clean finish.
Reapply every few years for added protection.

, This is strictly optional, but can add a level of dimension to your work, especially if it is a tile or table. You can affix pieces of tesserae to the edges using the same mortar and grout steps. Another great option is the paint the edges using an acrylic paint. You can also pack grout onto the edges, using a spatula, for a more textured look.,"

",How to Make Ribbon Covered Canisters," You can use old glass candle holders, an oat or cocoa container or an old tin. Make sure to choose something that can be permanently decorated.;
, Write down the measurement. Carry it with you when you go shopping for ribbon.

, You can buy ribbons by the roll in craft stores or online. You can also go to some craft stores and buy lengths of ribbon, instead of buying an entire roll.


Choose between 4 and 20 different types of ribbon depending upon the size of your canisters. You will want to choose wide and thin ribbons for a varied look.

, This will allow you to start with a solid base on which to place the ribbon. After cutting a piece the height and a few inches more than the circumference of the canister, squeeze thin strips of hot glue across the paper and on the ends.


Align the paper with the canister and glue it where it overlaps. Allow the hot glue to dry for at least 30 minutes before continuing with your project. You can also use rubber cement for this portion of the project.

, Do this all at once, so that you can focus on affixing the ribbons while the glue is still hot. Create your pattern by aligning your ribbons in your desired order on a table.

, Carefully and quickly, press it onto the bottom edge of the canister, making sure it is taught. You will start from the bottom and go towards the top.


Decide where you want the ribbons to meet. You may want to align it with the ends of the scrapbooking paper.

, In some areas, you may choose to leave a small space so you can layer with another ribbon later on. Make sure the ribbon is straight before the glue dries.


Do not use too much hot glue. Focus on attaching a very thin strip or dot on the ends. Overuse of glue may result in a lumpy project or burns from dripping glue.

, Return and place a dot of hot glue on any areas that look loose.

, You may also choose to place thin ribbons on top of thick ones to create more design and depth.

, Affix the item to the canister with a dab of hot glue and allow it to dry.

To work out the length, get a piece of string and hold it around your neck. Stand in front of the mirror and keep moving the string length until it is of the length you desire, then this string forms your length template.
Just be sure to add a small amount extra for making the end loop when the lengths are joined together.

, Choose differing lengths and colors or patterns of ribbon and begin knotting them together to make the length that you've chosen for the necklace.

, It's recommended that you make at least five lengths, so that there are enough lengths for the necklace to look interesting. You can have many more lengths, as wished.

, At one end, tie in a neat loop and knot, joining the ends together permanently. On the other end, stitch a large button to the other end, layered one on top of the other. The stitches will keep this end intact.


The button must be large enough to not fall back through the loop but not so large that it doesn't fit through the loop with a bit of a push.

, To wear, bring the necklace together around your neck and put the button through the loop to hold it in place.

Continue with as many beads as you'd like to add.,
Finish the ends of the necklace.",How to Make a Knotted Ribbon Necklace3," Pick a color you like, and one that matches the beads you'll be using.

, Once you have this length, double it, to account for the knots that you're about to make. Then cut the ribbon to size.


To work out the length, get a piece of string and hold it around your neck. Stand in front of the mirror and keep moving the string length until it is of the length you desire, then this string forms your length template.

, These can of any size, but always be sure to match large beads with wide length ribbon and smaller beads with narrower ribbon.

, Take it to the center of the ribbon, then knot each side of the ribbon to keep it in place.

, Knot in place.

, Knot in place.

, You might add only five very large beads, leaving a lot of ribbon for the rest of the necklace, or you might add a whole long row of smaller beads, leaving less ribbon on the necklace.

, You can simply knot the end together, or attach a clasp (such as a lobster claw clasp) or a button and buttonhole in the ribbon.


Be sure to adjust the necklace to the length you want it before adding the final fittings. If, for any reason, you find the ribbon has become too short, add some wide elastic to lengthen the necklace and stitch in place. If you do this, there is no need to attach a fitting, as the necklace will stretch over your head.

Hang your mobile.",How to Make a Ribbon Mobile," Depending on how large you want your mobile to be, and where you want to hang it, you have size options. If you’re hanging it over a large buffet table at a party, you might want to grab a larger hoop. If you’re hanging it over a small changing table in a nursery, you will probably want a smaller hoop. It’s important to think about the space and the purpose of your ribbon mobile before you select the hoop you’ll use.


You can buy these hoops at most craft stores, and can also certainly purchase them online.;
, This step is completely optional, but you may want to do it if you dislike its color and are planning on having a bit of the hoop showing through the ribbons. Many of the hoops available for purchase are wooden or silver. Use a spray paint to paint the hoop whatever color you want. You can paint it a more neutral color, or a color that will match your ribbons.


Make sure you let the hoop dry completely before attaching any ribbons.
If you’d rather not use paint, you can also wind ribbon over the hoop.

, If you want to add even more character to your mobile, you can skip the plain hoop all together. You can purchase any sort of fun wreathor even a hula hoopto create your mobile. If you’re super handy, you can even create your own hoop from materials you have in your house. Anything circular can work!

, Decide how far you want the ribbons to hang. Then, fold each on top of itself and cut, so that you are getting ribbons that are twice as long as you want them to hang. You can cut all of your ribbons same length, but varying the length can add a lot of interest to the mobile. Just remember, always double the ribbon over before cutting, so each strand is twice as long.You can purchase a variety of ribbons from your local craft store.
Don’t be afraid to mix patterns, colors, textures, and so on. A good variety can make your mobile eye-catching and fun.

, The mobile won’t be quite as pretty if all of the ribbons are tied to the hoop in clunky knots. A hitch knot allows you to attach the ribbons to the hoop without any unsightly knots. Fortunately, these knots are pretty easy to master.Fold your ribbon in half, so that you have two strands of ribbon.
Place the fold of the ribbon where you want it on the mobile, on the inside of the hoop. In other words, there should be little ribbon loop where you want the ribbons to be tied.Pull the fold, or loop, of the ribbon over the hoop.
Grab the two strands of ribbons and pull it through the loop of the ribbon, which is wrapped over the hoop.
Pull both ends equally to secure your hitch knot on the hoop.

, Continue knotting your ribbons on your mobile. You can add just a few strands and create a minimalistic mobile, or you can cover every inch of the hoop with ribbons. It depends on your personal preference, as well as your ribbon supply!

, Decide where you want to hang your mobile. If you aren’t quite sure, get a chair or a stool to hold your mobile up to the ceiling at potential spots. That way, you can avoid drilling a hole into your ceiling only to discover it’s in the wrong spot. Once you’ve selected the hanging location, screw a cup hook into the ceiling., There are a few different ways you can do this. If you’d rather not tie any more knots, you can use this method with fishing line. Decide how far down you want the mobile to hang, and measure out that length in fishing line. Then, like you did with the ribbon, double it and cut. Do this twice. Then, lay them on the floor so that they form a large plus sign. Lay the hook on the plus sign, and pull the four ends of the fishing lines over the hoop, so that they can hold the hoop in suspension. Tie the four ends together.Because fishing line is clear, you can certainly also just tie the fishing line to the hoop, then tie the opposite ends together.

, Once you’ve gotten your fish line securely in place, hold it up to make sure the mobile hangs evenly. You don’t want your mobile to dip to one side. Then, slip your fishing line over the cup hook. Take a step back and admire your work! You’ve created an easy, affordable ribbon mobile to spruce up any space.

Scissors
Two long sewing pins
Thread
24-gauge wire
Wire cutters
Hot glue gun and glue
Gold rhinestones;
, Start by making a single red poinsettia. To make it, you will need strips of green ribbon for the leaves, plus longer and shorter strips of red ribbon for the flower. Cut out:


Three four-inch (10 cm) strips of red ribbon
Two two-inch (5 cm) strips of red ribbon
Two six-inch (15 cm) strips of green ribbon

, With each piece of ribbon, you need both ends to come to a point, rather than being squared. Fold each piece of ribbon in half lengthwise. To make the pointed ends:At one end, cut from the tip of the folded edge downward at a 45-degree angle. Repeat on the other side.
Open the fold, and the ribbon will have a triangular edge. Repeat with each piece of ribbon.

, With each piece of red ribbon, you need to create a few folds to give the ribbon a more flower-like shape. To fold the ribbon strips, you need to:Fold the ribbon in half lengthwise, so the velvet sides are touching. Press down with your finger to make a crease in the ribbon.
On one side, fold the ribbon in half again the other way to expose the velvet side, and make a crease. Repeat on the other side.
Pinch the ribbon in the center and flare out the ribbon on either side. Pierce the ribbon through the middle of all three folds with the sewing pin. Do this with all three long strips, and pierce them all with the same pin.
Repeat with the smaller red ribbon strips, but pierce them with the second pin.

, Start with the longer red strips. Unwrap a length of wire from the spool and wrap it around the center points twice, right beside where the pin is. Remove the pin.You should now have six red flower petals. With the same length of wire, wrap the wire around the base of each petal once. This will help to separate the petals and keep them in place. When you have wrapped the base of each petal with wire, cut the wire with the wire cutter.
Repeat these steps with the smaller red ribbon strips. You will end up with a smaller flower with two petals.

, These two flowers will actually be glued together to create a single flower, because poinsettias have layers of larger and smaller flower petals. Plug in your hot glue gun.


When the glue is ready, place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center front (the velvet side) of the larger flower. Center the smaller flower over top of this and press it into the glue so that both velvet sides are facing up and the center wire bands match up., With the green ribbon strips, fold each piece in half lengthwise with the velvet sides touching. Make a crease in the ribbon. Pinch the center of each ribbon and criss-cross the strips so they make an X. Open up the ends of the ribbon.


With a new length of wire, attach the two pieces of ribbon together by wrapping the wire around horizontally and then vertically around the meeting point. When you have finished wrapping the leaves, wrap the wire around to the back (shiny side) of the ribbon and leave a four-inch (10 cm) stem of wire before cutting.

, Place a pea-sized dab of glue at the center of the green ribbons. Center the red ribbon flower over this and press it into the glue.


To make the stamen at the center of the flower, place three or four small dots of glue into the center of the flower, and affix a gold rhinestone to each dab.

, Repeat these steps to make more red, white, and pink poinsettia flowers with green leaves. You will need about 10 to make a basic garland.

, To make your garland, you can affix the ribbon flowers to a premade garland. Check craft stores, hobby stores, Christmas stores, or online for a base.Garland bases are usually real or synthetic evergreen boughs that are made from or designed to mimic pine, fir, and other coniferous trees. Synthetic garlands will last much longer than ones made from real trees.

, There are a number of ways that you can decorate the garland with your flowers, and how you do it is a matter of personal preference. You can put the flowers on:


In a straight line
So that they cover the garland base
In a zig-zag pattern
With one at each end and one in the center

, When you’ve decided how you want to arrange the flowers on the garland, you can attach them properly. Take the wire stem from the leaves and wrap it around the entire garland base or just a few sprigs on the garland. Once you’ve attached the flower, fluff the garland so there aren't any bare spots.


If you didn’t leave a wire stem on your flowers, you can also affix the flowers with florist’s tape or with a needle and thread., There are many different flowers you can make with ribbon, including the ever-popular rose. To make these roses, you'll need 36 inches (91 cm) of florist’s ribbon or satin ribbon that’s 1.25 inches (3 cm) wide. You'll also need a measuring tape, tweezers, and thread or wire to secure the ribbon ends.Lay the ribbon flat on a table. Measure three inches (7.5 cm) in from one of the ends. At that point, make a 45-degree fold toward you, so that the ribbon forms an upside down L. Make a crease to secure the fold.
Turn the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise direction. Make another 45-degree fold toward you. Continue turning the ribbon 90 degrees in a counter-clockwise fashion and making a 45-degree fold. It will look like you're folding the ribbon into a small square. Stop when you have folded all but a three-inch (7.5-cm) tail at either end of the ribbon.
At the end of the ribbon where you finished, trim the end to create a point. Push the end of the tweezers through the center of the squares from the bottom. Place the pointed end of the ribbon in between the tweezer prongs. Apply pressure to the tweezers as you pull the pointed end of the ribbon through the center of the squares and out the bottom. Continue pulling until you have a two-inch (five-cm) tail coming through the center.
Hold on to the ribbon tail you pulled through the center, and gently spin the ribbon around in a counter-clockwise direction. As you do this, the ribbon squares will twist around the center, forming petals. Continue twisting until all the layers of ribbon squares have twisted into a rose shape.
On the underside, hold the two ribbon ends together and secure them together with a needle and thread or wire wrap before trimming the excess.

, Daisies are another popular flower that you can make with ribbon, and there are a wide variety of ribbon colors you can use to make these daisies. All you need for this project is 60 inches (152 cm) of satin ribbon that’s five-eights of an inch (1.6 cm) wide, scissors, a needle and thread, hot glue, and a rhinestone or gem for the center of the flower.Pinch one end of the ribbon between your thumb and forefinger. Measure out a piece of ribbon that’s 1.5 to two inches (3.8 to five cm) in length, then fold the ribbon back on itself to make a loop. Pinch the ribbon between your same thumb and forefinger to keep the loop secure.
Continue making loops in the ribbon like this, stacking them on top of each other like accordion folds. You should make at least 10 to 15 loops, because each of these will become a flower petal.
When you’ve made all the loops you want, use the needle and thread to secure the loops together. Place a few stitches on the bottom left corner of the loops (under where your thumb and forefinger were pinching the ribbon).
Gradually fan out the ribbon loops so they make a complete circle like a flower. Adjust the loops so they are evenly distributed around the circle. When you're finished, turn the flower over to the side without the stitching. Place a pea-sized dab of hot glue in the center of the flower and secure a pearl, gem, or rhinestone.

, Carnations are popular flowers for events like Mother’s Day, so a ribbon carnation is a lovely project if you want to make a ribbon flower wreath, broach, hair piece, or other craft. For this flower, you need 4.4 yards (400 meters) of wire-edged ribbon that’s one inch (25 cm) wide. You'll also need a needle, thread, and a pair of scissors.Take one end of the ribbon and push back the ribbon to expose the wire within. Gently tug the wire away from the ribbon. As you do so, slide the ribbon down the wire in the opposite direction, so it gathers toward the middle of the ribbon. Continue sliding the ribbon down the wire until you’ve gathered the entire piece down to about 30 inches (75 cm).
Trim off the excess wire, leaving a one-inch (2.5-cm) tail. Tie a knot in the end of the ribbon where the wire is exposed, making sure to gather the wire end into the knot as well.
Using the knot as the center of the flower, gradually wind the ribbon around the center knot, being sure that the gathered edge of the ribbon is exposed at the top. After every few laps around the knot, stop to put a few stitches into the ribbon on the underside to secure it in place. Continue wrapping the ribbon around the center and stitching every few wraps to secure the ribbon.
When you get to the end of the ribbon, tie a knot that incorporates the wire inside as well. Trim off the excess ribbon from the knots at both ends, being careful not to cut the knots themselves.
Finish wrapping the last layer of ribbon, and use the needle and thread to stitch it in place. Turn the flower to the right side and use your finger tips to gently pull and fluff out the gathers to fill out the flower.

Seal your work, then allow the tiles to dry once again.,
Add a small or medium-sized felt pad to the back of each tile.",How to Make Ink Stamped Coasters1," The best material to work with is terracotta or travertine. Avoid glazed tiles, as they are difficult to work with. Most importantly, if they aren't sealed properly, the ink will rub right off.;
, You can also wipe the tiles down with rubbing alcohol instead; it does the same job and dries a lot faster. Cleaning the tiles is very important, as they tend to come very dusty. Cleaning your tiles ensures that your design comes out neat and clean.


Don't forget to wipe the back of the tiles down as well.

, For best results, choose a permanent, self-setting ink. It will ensure that your work lasts longer. If you choose to use a hybrid, heat-setting ink, you will need to bake your tiles in the oven.


Choose a dark or bright color that stands out against your tile.

, Do not rock the stamp back and forth. Instead, press it straight down onto the tile, hold it for about 5 seconds, then lift it straight back up. If you rock your stamp, you may end up smudging your design.

, If you used hybrid or some other heat-setting ink, you will need to heat-set them using a heat gun or an oven. Each brand may be a little different, so read the instructions on your ink. In most cases, you should be able to pop your tiles into the oven, and bake them at 250°F (122°C) for 30 minutes.If you plan on baking your tiles, place them onto a foil lined baking sheet. Allow them to cool completely after baking before moving on.If you used a permanent, self-setting ink, then you do not need to bake your tiles.

, Give your tiles a light coat of acrylic sealer. Alternatively, you can also use a sealer designed for natural tiles. Let the sealer dry before applying a second coat.


The sealer will make the tile less-porous. If you have a simple image, consider coating just the image with a squeeze-on or brush-on sealing glaze., You will need four felt pads, one for each corner.You can also use rubber or cork pads. Alternatively, you can also hot glue a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square cut out of a thin sheet of cork to the back of your tile. These will prevent the tiles from scratching up your table or counter.

, Acrylic paints tend to be the best for this project, in any colors suitable to matching the candle. When choosing the paint, if it is not certain from the paint instructions as to suitability, ask the retailer for help.


Be aware that not all paint will adhere well.
It's a good idea to ensure that the paint chosen is non-toxic, as the candle will burn through the designs eventually, releasing smoke and particulate matter into the air, air which you and your family breathe.

, It is best to keep this simple and repeat the same one or two symbols. Some ideas for simple and effective designs include:


Celestial objects: Sun, moon, star, rainbow, etc.
Animal: Dog, cat, mouse, etc.
Plant: Flowers, trees, leaves, etc.

, Either draw a design onto thin cardboard or use an existing stencil. If making it on cardboard, cut out the template design.

, Transfer the outline of the template onto the eraser using pencil or a marker that works on the eraser. It can help to use a bit of poster tack to keep the cardboard template in place, while a stencil sheet should be held in place with care as you draw around its outline.


Repeat for any additional designs, using separate erasers.

, This is now your stamp for adding the design image to the candle.

, Are you using just one symbol or perhaps two? How will two or more designs be interwoven down the candle? Work this out on paper beforehand. Some approaches might include:


Rows or columns of a single design; or use two designs and alternate the rows or designs
Make a band or two of a single design only, perhaps across the top or base of the candle
Follow a pattern that uses the design to form the shape or outline of a word, geometric shape, picture, etc.
Easiest of all––simply add designs randomly. This option is the best if younger children are making the candles, as they don't have to line anything up or get the patterning accurate.

, Use a color that complements or contrasts well with that of the candle.

, To do this, hold the stamp to the candle where you wish to place the design and press firmly. Pull away quickly and cleanly to avoid smudging the stamp. Repeat as often as required to achieve the overall design, adding the design to the locations you've already chosen.

, The time required for drying will depend on the paint used; read its relevant instructions. Overnight is a safe bet, so plan on leaving to dry before lighting the candle the next day.

, You should do this even if the tiles look clean. They are often coated with a thin film of dust, which can prevent the ink from adhering properly.


You can also wipe the tiles down with rubbing alcohol instead; it dries a lot faster.
Be sure to wipe the back of the tiles as well.

, Choose a large stamp with subtle, non-distracting pattern, such as wood grain, cheesecloth, or romantic text.It should be the same size, or larger, as your tile. Next, coat the stamp evenly with ink. Consider a color that is similar to the tile, but a shade darker. For example, you could use dark grey for a light grey tile, and dark brown for a terracotta tile. This will keep the background from competing against the main image.


For best results, use a permanent, self-setting ink.If you choose to use a hybrid or heat-set ink, you will need to bake your tiles in the oven.If the stamp is too big for the pad, flip the stamp over, then rub the pad against it., Press the stamp straight down onto the tile using a lot of pressure. Do not rock the stamp, as this may smudge your design. Wait a few seconds, then carefully lift it away. Let the ink dry completely before moving on.If your background stamp was smaller than your tile, move it down to the next section of tile, and stamp another row.
Don't worry if your design did not come out perfectly sharp and clear. This rustic look is part of the overall design.

, Choose a stamp with a pretty image or design that you like, such as a flower, bird, or butterfly. Ink the stamp with a darker color, such as black.


Make sure that you are using the same type of ink as before. Do not mix hybrid and permanent inks.
If you plan on filling your image in, choose an outline image rather than a solid one.

, Make sure that the background image is completely dry. Carefully position your stamp, then press it straight down against the tile. Hold it for about 5 seconds, then carefully pull it away.It is very important that you don't rock the stamp at this point. If you do, you may end up smudging the background off., If you used a translucent image, you might want to color it in. If you used a solid image, you can skip this step and move on. Dip a sponge dauber or pouncer into translucent ink, then pat it against your main image. Be careful not to rub the stamped image.Add more colors to create depth and layers. Allow each layer to dry before adding a second one., If you used hybrid or a heat-setting ink, you will need to heat-set it using a heat gun or oven. Each brand is different, so check the instructions on your ink container. Typically, you should be able to pop your tiles into the oven, and bake them at 250°F (122°C) for 30 minutes.If you are going to bake your tiles, put them onto a foil lined baking sheet. Let them cool completely before moving on.
If you used a permanent, self-setting ink, then you do not need to bake the tiles.

, You can seal your work using a clear, acrylic spray or a special sealer designed for natural tiles.Allow the sealer to dry before applying a second coat.


While you can seal just the design on simpler tiles, you won't be able to do it here; you will have to seal the entire tile in order to protect the background image.

, You will need 4 felt pads, 1 for each corner.You can also use rubber or cork pads. Alternatively, you can use a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) square out of a thin sheet of cork, then hot glue it to the back of your tile. The felt/rubber/cork backing will help protect your table or counter against scratches from the tiles.

Or buy a letter stamp set so you can spell out your favorite quotes, lyrics, or passages from books!You can find these online or in-store at arts & crafts shops, office supply stores, or even boutiques specializing in stamps.;
, Design your own stamp by tracing your outline on a foam sheet and then cutting it out with scissors or a utility knife. If the sheet is very thin, place a second piece underneath the first when you cut out the design, and then glue the two together with a hot glue gun.Once you have cut out your design, cut a second or third piece of foam that is slightly larger.
Make it square or rectangular, and glue it to your design-piece as backing.
This will give you something to grip so you don’t squeeze the design-piece by accident and ruin your stamp.

, If you want firmer material for your homemade stamp, use a raw potato and cookie cutters. Peel off the skin with a potato peeler. Then slice off a rounded side with a paring knife so you have a nice flat area to use as a stamp. Press your cookie cutter (or any other hard, suitable outline, like the rim of a tin can) into the flat flesh. Then trim away the surrounding flesh from the outline.Once you’re done, place the face of the potato (the area that will be your stamp) onto a paper towel so the moisture is drawn out.
Then place it on a new, dry towel to test for any remaining moisture before you begin stamping.

, If you remember the standard off-red or black stamp pads that are usually used with date stamps, look again. Stamp pads come in all colors, and they even come in multiple colors. Choose one or two colors that suit your style to get started.

, Water based markers are the least expensive way to add lots of custom colors to your stamp. The best part is that you can color directly onto the design, so you can make only those parts you want a certain color.

, If, during the coloring process, the ink has dried out, breathe warm air over it to re-moisten it a bit.

, Do not rock or jiggle the stamp. That will cause it to smear. Lift the stamp carefully.

, You can add your own calligraphy, drawing, or writing, or use it in conjunction with other stamps. Balloons, for example, could be part of ""happy birthday"" or ""congratulations"" or ""thank you"", or you could draw a clown to go with them. Things like balloons and flowers can also be part of a larger bunch. Stamp yourself a whole garden, if you like.

, A simple way to add depth and visual interest to a stamped project is to cut out around your stamps. Then, attach them to your card or scrapbook with a bit of folded paper (or another material to add thickness) behind them to make them pop up, out of the page.

, To improve the life of your stamps, and to remove ink for next time, blot the rubber stamping surface against a moistened paper towel. Don't get the wood backing wet. Then, allow them to dry thoroughly before putting them away.

, You can carve your own stamp out of a potato, a sponge, an eraser, a piece of wood, or another block of soft material. Remember to start with a flat surface and carefully carve out any part you don't want in the stamp. You can trace the design with a pen, first.


A potato is a good, inexpensive material if you want to try your own stamp or you're using a messy color, such as paint, but it won't last long.
A cellulose sponge will produce a stamp with a built-in texture. Even if you don't cut it up, it can be great for creating a textured background.
You can attach your homemade stamp to a backing, such as wood or cardboard, or use it directly if the material is stiff enough.
Remember that any design you do, and especially any letters you cut must be the mirror image of what you want to appear on paper.

, Look in your local phone book or on the web for ""custom rubber stamp"". Many shops will cut a design that you give them.

Choose a suitable lampshade.,
Clean the surface.,
Map your pattern with tape.",How to Make a Stamped Lampshade2," For easy transfers, use a square lampshade with a flat, even surface so you don’t have to worry about rounding your stamp over a curved surface. Of course, most lampshades are curved, so with these, use one with a smooth surface to make rounding your stamp easier.Lampshades aren’t that expensive, so if your lamp has a ribbed or other irregular surface, keep the lamp and replace the shade.

, If you purchased a new lampshade for this project, go ahead and skip this step. However, if you’re stamping an old one, remove any dust or dirt from the surface, since these may block your paint, create incomplete prints, and/or stick to your stamp. Wipe it down with a duster and/or vacuum the surface.Use your vacuum’s dusting brush or upholstery attachment.

, If you like chaotic, random designs, feel free to stamp your lampshade wherever your whim takes you. But if you want to create a more structured look, figure out what pattern you want to follow beforehand. Use tape to form a neat grid or borders for an alternating pattern between rows or columns.Also tape the edgings to protect them in case the stamp overlaps them in your top or bottom row.

"

Protect your work surface.,
Mix your paint.,
Load your stamp.,
Stamp your lampshade.,
Repeat, clean up, and dry.",How to Make a Stamped Lampshade3," Cover your work table with a drop cloth, old towel, newspaper, or similar material. If young children are involved, consider layering similar material over the surrounding floor. Also, have cleaning materials handy in case of spills. Once your work table is set up, remove the shade from the lamp and place it on the work table.Paper towels and water will clean up fresh paint easily.

, Expect any type of paint to work well with lampshades.If you’re happy with your paint’s exact shade, simply squirt or dab some onto a paper plate. Or add one or more shades to the first and stir them on the plate with a plastic spoon or similar tool until they’re evenly mixed.For a more varied look, consider altering the paint’s shade row by row. For example, start with, say, kelly green for the top row. Then mix it with a lighter green for the row below that. As you go down, add more and more white paint to the mix for even paler shades.

, First, have a second paper plate handy. Then dunk your stamp in the paint on the first plate. Press the wet end lightly into the second plate a couple of time to remove excess paint and avoid any runs or drips on your lampshade.You don’t want any extra paint on your stamp, but you don’t want to remove too much, either.
Take a test run first and count how many prints you make on the dry plate before the they start to look incomplete.
Depending on the size of your lampshade, you may need several paper plates for this over the course of your project, especially if you are using more than one color or shade.

, Press your loaded stamp gently on the shade’s surface. If your shade is curved, roll the stamp from side to side so all of it makes contact with the shade. Use light, even pressure as you do so in order to create a more uniform stamp instead of one that is darker on one side than the other.Also be careful not to grip your stamp too tightly if you are using materials like foam or toilet paper rolls. You don’t want to squeeze or crush it, since this will alter your stamp’s shape.
If you are using a foam or premade stamp with intricate designs, test how much pressure you should use on a paper plate before you start on the lampshade.
You can also practice your rolling technique on a curved object of similar size, like a plastic bucket.

, Continue filling in your pattern until you finish. Once you’re done, strip your tape off the lampshade, especially if your stamps overlap it at any point. If you intend to reuse your stamp, clean it immediately with soap and warm water. Then let the stamps on your lampshade dry before handling it again.If your stamps covered the tape on your lampshade, the paint may seal it to the shade as it dries, which could make later removal less neat.

Gather your materials.,
Make a glitter station.,
Prepare the wood.,
Create your design area.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood1," There are a number of different adhesive products that you can use to apply glitter. You can either use glue, spray adhesive, paint, or decoupage. You can either use a foam wedge or an inexpensive paintbrush to apply the glitter.


You can purchase these materials at a craft store or a large retailer.
You can sprinkle the glitter on the wood using your hands or a shaker that has large holes.;
, Glitter has a reputation for making a mess so you’ll want to make a glitter station that is easy to clean. Ideally, you could work outside so you don’t have to worry about cleaning glitter from carpet or your furniture. For your glitter station, you’ll need to select the products that you want to use for your project. Use a cardboard box if you are working with larger pieces of wood. You can use a paper plate for smaller projects., The wooden item that you want to add glitter to can be in a variety of shapes in sizes. Sanded and smooth wood will allow the glitter to adhere evenly, though you can use non-sanded wood to create a more rugged design.


You can sand the wood using a piece of fine-grained sand paper if you desire.

, You can section off areas of the wooden object to create glitter designs. If you intend to add glitter to the entirety of the wooden object, there is no need to do this. You will use clear tape to section off areas of the object that you do not want to glitter.


You can use adhesive stencils to create designs with the glitter.
You could use stickers to leave certain shapes un-glittered, like a heart or a star.

wine glasses
cardboard
paper plate
painter’s tape
large paint brush
glitter
scissors
isopropyl alcohol
cotton balls
ribbon;
, Drawing your design on a piece of paper will allow you to see what looks nice and what doesn't, and thus prevent you from making mistakes later on. While it is possible to clean off glitter and glue while they are still wet to change the design, it is better to get the design right the first time. Here are some popular design schemes for glitter wine glasses:









Apply glitter only to the base of the wine glass, leaving the rest of the glass blank. The glitter can also extend ½ to 1 inches (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) up the stem of the glass.
Apply glitter only to the stems of the wine glass, leaving the rest of the glass blank.
Create an initial or number using glitter.
Create stripes on the entire glass (or just the stem) using glitter.
Apply glitter to the entire glass, except for the top ½ to 1 inches (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters of the rim.
Create designs using two different colors of glitter.Create ombré designs by having two colors blend into one another.

, Find a flat table and cover it with some newspaper. You will be working with glue and glitter, which can be quite messy. You should also place a small piece of cardboard or cardstock on your workspace to use for glitter collection. This will make it easier to return the excess glitter to your glitter bottle for use in other projects.








, To ensure that the glitter will stick to the glass, you need to clean the glass really well. Use some cotton balls dipped in isopropyl alcohol to wipe the outer surface of the glass where you plan to apply the glitter.








After you have cleaned your glasses, set them aside for a few minutes and let the alcohol dry.

, Next, take your painter’s tape and cut it lengthwise to create a long thin strip. If you will be applying the glitter just onto the stem, then you can use a short strip. Place the tape around the area of the wine glass where you want your glitter to stop. Make sure that the tape is even and securely attached to the wine glass. Otherwise, you may end up with a crooked glitter line around your wine glass.








To apply glitter to the base of the wine glass, tape off the stem of the glass and leave the base exposed. You may also leave ½ to 1 inches (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) of the stem exposed as well; the glitter will then extend onto part of the stem.
To apply glitter to the stems of the wine glass, cover the base of the glass with tape. Then, cover the bottom portion of the bowl part with tape as well.
To create an initial or number using glitter, you may use an glue stencil or apply the glue directly to the glass free-hand.
To create stripes on the wine glass, simply wrap a long piece of tape around your glass in a spiral, creating a candy-cane effect. There should be spaces between the edges of the tape.
To use two or more colors, tape off the areas your do not want covered in glitter and apply the glue to the area of the first color. One you have applied the glitter and let the glue dry, you will apply the glue and glitter for the next color.
To create an ombré effect, simply tape off the bottom and top part of your design and work in the area between the pieces of tape.

, You will need to be able to dip your paint brush in the glue, so pour a generous amount of glue onto a paper plate. Make sure that there is enough to coat each glass with a thick layer of glue to ensure that the glitter will stick.







, When your tape is secured, take your paint brush and dip it into the glue. Then, begin painting the glue onto the lower half of the wine glass. Make sure that you apply an even, thick layer of glue to the wine glass.








You can also use a foam brush if you are worried about leaving streaks on the glass. A foam paintbrush may apply paint more evenly than a bristled paintbrush.

, After you have applied the glue to the wine glass, set aside the paint brush. Then, hold onto part of your wine glass that does not have any glue on it. Hold the glass over your piece of cardboard and begin pouring glitter over the glue-coated areas of your wine glass.








Keep pouring glitter over the glass until all of the glue-coated areas are covered in an even layer of glitter.
When you are finished, you can return the excess glitter to the bottle. Pick up the cardboard and bend it slightly to create a funnel and then pour the glitter into the glitter bottle.
If you want to do multiple colors of glitter, then you will need to let the first layer dry and then apply more glue to the glass. Then, pour your second glitter color as you did with the first layer.

, The wine glasses will need to dry for about an hour, but you may also leave them overnight to ensure that they are fully dry. The glasses will need to be completely dry before you can add the finishing touches.








Remember that if you will be applying more layers of glitter, you can do that after the first layer has dried.

, When the glasses are dry, slowly peel away the painter’s tape. After you remove the tape, there should be a sharp line dividing the glitter-covered glass and the glitter-free glass. Discard the tape after you remove it.







, Next, you will need to seal the glitter with more glue or with a sealing spray, such as Krylon Crystal Clear. To seal the glass with more glue, use your large paintbrush to paint on another layer of glue over the glitter. Then, let the glass dry for at least an hour.








If you plan to use a sealing spray, then you will need to go outside to seal your glass. Place the glass on a piece of newspaper on the ground outside and then spray the Krylon Crystal Clear onto the glittery areas of your glass. Then, allow the glass to dry for at least an hour.

, To add a cute finishing touch to your glass, take a piece of ribbon and tie it around the top of the stem on your glass. Tie the ribbon in a bow and adjust as needed. Now your glass is ready to use or to give as a gift!







, The glitter may smudge or come off easily if it is still a little wet. To ensure that the glitter is completely dry, you may want to leave your glasses out to dry overnight. Put them somewhere that is dry and out of the reach of children and pets.








, The glitter surface on your wine glass will be fragile, so you will need to take extra precautions to ensure that the glitter does not chip off when you clean it. Wash your glitter wine glasses by hand and try to avoid the glitter areas as much as possible when you wash them. Focus on cleaning the inside of the goblet and the rim of the wine glass.









Do not scrub the wine glasses. Instead, use a soft sponge and try to avoid the glittered areas. Do not put the wine glasses into the dishwasher.

, Do not let your glitter wine glasses sit in water. When you wash your wine glasses by hand, be sure to dry them off immediately afterwards with a soft towel. Otherwise, the excess moisture may cause the glitter to chip and flake off.

Purchase spray adhesive.,
Spray the surface of the wooden object.,
Apply glitter to the wet adhesive.,
Wait for the adhesive to dry.,
Seal the glitter in.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood2," For this method, you will need to purchase a spray adhesive. Make sure to find a spray adhesive that dries clear. You will want to work with spray adhesive outdoors, since it can contain chemicals that are harmful to breathe.


You can find spray adhesive at any craft store or major retailer.
If you are unable to work outside, work in a well-ventilated area.

, Be sure to follow any special directions from the manufacturer, if applicable. Hold the spray adhesive can a few inches away from the wood and press down on the top of the can to spray the wood.

, While the adhesive spray is still wet on the wood, sprinkle your glitter over the area. The amount of glitter that you use will determine how sparkly the wood is.


You can either sprinkle the glitter onto the area with your hands, or use a foam wedge or paintbrush to apply the glitter.

, The drying time will depend upon the specific adhesive spray that you use, but it should only take a few minutes for the area to completely dry.

, If you’d like, you can apply a sealant, like decoupage, to the area. The sealant will add smoothness and will help to prevent the glitter from falling off. Choose a sealant that has a glossy finish, not matte, so your glitter doesn’t lose any of its sparkle.Once the adhesive spray is dry, you can shake off any excess glitter into your cardboard box.

Use white glue to attach glitter.,
Apply a thin layer of glue.,
Dust glitter onto the glue.,
Let dry.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood3," You can also use basic white glue to apply glitter. You can use either a glue stick or a glue bottle. White glue is typically washable, meaning that it is water-soluble. Do not use white glue if you think that the wooden object will get wet, like if you intend to leave it outdoors.

, You can either use the squeeze bottle to directly apply the glue to the wood, or you can paint it on using a foam wedge or paintbrush. With a glue stick, you can apply the glue directly to the wood.


Thicker layers of glue will appear raised when they dry. This might look best for your project, or you might prefer a flatter glittered area.

, You can dust the wet glue with glitter, covering as much or as little of the wood as you'd like.

, The glue will dry clear so only the glitter will remain. The actual time it takes for the glue to dry will depend upon how thick of a glue layer you’ve applied.


Apply a sealant, if desired. Like with the spray adhesive method, you can use a spray sealant to smooth your dried glitter. This will help to prevent glitter from falling off, and eliminates some of the rough texture.

Use decoupage gloss sealer.,
Paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer.,
Sprinkle glitter over the wet gloss.,
Let dry.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood4," Decoupage gloss sealer is a crafting product that is used to seal small pieces, like glitter or a piece of fabric, under a clear and durable gloss. You can find decoupage gloss sealer, which you may find packaged as ‘gloss sealer’, at craft stores.Choose a decoupage gloss sealer that is acrylic if you need a more heavy-duty seal.
Be sure to purchase a glossy finish sealer; matte sealers will dull your glitter’s shine on the finished product., While working in your glitter station, use an inexpensive paintbrush to paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer to the wood. Be sure to only paint the areas that you want glitter to adhere to.


Make sure that the paintbrush doesn’t leave streaks while you are painting. You want the layer of gloss sealer to be evenly applied on the wood., While the gloss is still wet, sprinkle glitter onto the wood. You can use as much, or as little, glitter as you’d like.


Feel free to add a second layer of gloss over the glitter. This acts as a sealant and helps to prevent prevents glitter from falling off.

, Let your newly glittered piece dry. Depending on how many layers of decoupage gloss sealer you’ve added, drying times will vary.

Use Mod Podge.,
Paint on a thin layer of Mod Podge.,
Add glitter.,
Let dry.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood5," Mod Podge is one of the most recognizable crafting supplies on the market. It is similar to glue, but it also seals and adds a finish. There are a number of different finishes that you can choose. For a glitter project, you should use either the Classic Gloss or the Hard Coat finish.Hard Coat finish is best for objects that are going to be handled frequently and is the most durable., Using a cheap paintbrush or a foam wedge, apply a thin coat of Mod Podge to the area of the wood that you want to glitter., While the Mod Podge is still wet, either sprinkle or use a foam wedge to add glitter. You can add as much or as little glitter as you’d like.

, Mod Podge has to ‘cure’ to dry. This means that while it might feel dry to the touch after an hour, it still needs several more hours before you should handle the wood. Hard Coat Mod Podge takes 72 hours to cure, so leave your newly glittered item in a safe place while it is curing."
"
Use a craft paint.,
Paint the wood.,
Let the paint dry.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood6," Acrylic paint is a good choice but many paints will work, just as long as they have a thicker consistency. Thin paints like watercolors should not be used, since they are not thick enough to adhere glitter.

, Using a paintbrush, add a layer of paint to the area of wood you want to glitter.


If the wooden item is large, it's a good idea to paint it in sections and then apply glitter to each section. This helps to avoid the possibility that the paint dries before you have a chance to add glitter.
Sprinkle the glitter onto the wet paint.

, The glitter will set in place with the paint. You can either leave the project as is or add another coat of paint and glitter.


This method can either add a subtle sparkle, or you can apply a thick layer of glitter for a more striking effect.

Use spray-on glitter.,
Spray the glitter onto wood.,
Spray on another layer of glitter.",How to Apply Glitter to Wood7," You can also use a can of spray-on glitter to add shine and sparkle to your wooden projects. Spray-on glitter cans can be found at craft stores and some major retailers.


Do not use spray-on glitter indoors, especially in an area that is not well ventilated. If possible, work outdoors.

, This will directly apply the glitter to the wood and use a sealant to attach it. You can sprinkle additional glitter onto the wood while the spray is drying, or leave it as is., Once the first layer of glitter has dried, you can spray on additional layers of glitter. You can add as many layers as you'd like, but let the adhesive dry in between applications. The more layers you apply, the thicker the application will be and your project will be more glittery.

Work quickly so the ink stays wet.,
Do not touch your inked image until it's dry.,
Avoid permanent markers on stamps.",How to Ink Stamps with Markers," Before you start inking stamps with markers, select the right markers for your needs. The type of markers you use depend on what kind of image you're trying to create.If you're trying for a water colored effect, go for water-based markers. These will fade together slightly, creating a blurred water color effect.
If you're trying layer, or create a permanent effect on a variety of surfaces, go for alcohol and solvent based colors.
Embossing markers work very well for coloring stamps. They come out very bright, but do take a long time to dry.;
, Before you begin stamping, especially if you're using brand new stamps, you should prepare your stamps for inking. Take a sanding block and very gently scrub it across the stamp. This will rough up the edges of the stamp slightly so it will better take the ink., In addition to using water-based markers, spritzing your stamps lightly before inking them can help with the water colored effect. If you want a strong water color effect, take a small spray bottle filled with water. Spritz your stamps lightly before you get to work on inking them., You should use markers with a brush tip on one end. Using light, swiping motions, color directly on the stamp with the brush tip.Color in the parts of the stamp you want to show up on the paper. If you, for example, don't want the outlines of the image to show up, avoid coloring them.
Keep your hands steady, especially if you're using more than one color, so colors do not bleed together.

, Multiple colors can make for a striking stamped image. Switch up colors as needed to create the desired effect. For example, say you're coloring in a flower. You can use green on the leaves and then white on the petals.Again, you want to keep your hands as steady as possible. You want the separate to be distinct when you use your stamp.

, As markers are not as moist as conventional ink, you'll need to breathe on the stamp slightly to moisten the ink so it sticks on the page. Hold the stamp a little away from your mouth and huff on it several times., Take the paper or object where you're stamping the image. Press the stamp down on the surface, using a little force. Gently pull the stamp away. Your image should be transferred to your chosen surface., You're unlikely to get the exact shape you want the first time. As with anything, it takes a little experimentation. If you don't like the image you produced, gently wash off the stamp in water. Allow it to dry and experiment with other marker types and colors., Marker can dry much faster than ink. Therefore, work as quickly as you can while still keeping steady. You want to make sure the marker ink remains wet so you can successfully transfer your image to a page.As it takes awhile to get a hang of coloring your stamps, you may smudge your colors the first few times as you try to work fast. You may have to experiment several times before you get the precise image you want, so be patient.

, Once you've stamped your chosen surface, allow it to dry. Do not touch the image until the marker ink has dried. Times will vary depending on the type of markers you use., You should never use permanent markers on stamps. This can affect their color long term, preventing you from reusing your stamps in the future."

Pour some salt into a sealable plastic bag.,
Add several drops of food coloring to the bag.,
Seal the plastic bag and mix the salt and food coloring.,
Open the bag and allow the salt to dry.",How to Make Salt Glitter1," To avoid having to wash any bowls or dishes, you can mix your salt glitter in a plastic bag that seals closed. You’ll need a bag for each color of glitter that you want to make. Fill them with as much salt as you’d like, though you shouldn’t fill them to the brim or the glitter will be difficult to mix later.You can use any type of salt that you like, such as regular non-iodized table salt. However, coarser salts, including kosher and sea salt, usually work best. You can even use epsom salt, which tends to sparkle on its own.
Keep in mind that the amount of salt you use is the amount of glitter you’ll wind up with in the end.;
, Once you’ve placed the salt in the plastic bag, it’s time to color the glitter. Squeeze several drops of liquid food coloring into the salt in your desired shade.You can add as much or as little food coloring to the salt as you’d like. However, the more salt that you’re using, the more food coloring you’ll need to add.
In most cases, the more food coloring you add, the darker and more saturated the finished color will be. You may need to add as many as 10 drops if you want very dark glitter and you’re making a large batch.
For soft, pastel glitter, 1 or 2 drops of food coloring may be enough.
It’s usually best to start out with a small amount of food coloring. You can always add more if you want to deepen the glitter’s color.

, After you’ve added the food coloring to the salt, close the plastic bag. Shake the bag thoroughly, moving the salt and coloring around together to mix them completely.To ensure that none of the salt falls out of the bag while you’re mixing, fold down the sealed edge and hold that in your hand as you shake the bag.
If the glitter isn’t the shade that you want after shake the bag, add more food coloring and mix the bag again. Repeat the process until you’re satisfied with the glitter’s color.

, When the salt glitter is the color that you’d like, open the bag so air can reach it. Leave the bag out in a warm, dry spot, and let it dry completely. In most cases, you’ll only need to dry the glitter for 2 to 3 hours.If you’ve made a large batch of glitter, you may need to leave it to dry longer. You can leave it to dry overnight to be safe.
Once the glitter is dry, you can transfer it to storage containers, such as old salt shakers.

",How to Make Silk Screen Stencils2,", There should be at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric outside of the embroidery hoop.

,,


Cover the entire fabric area around the outline of the design using a large paintbrush. If you are planning on using a stencil brush instead of a squeegee to make the silk screen image, then an inch or so of glue around the design will suffice.

Preheat the oven.,
Place some salt in a bowl or tupperware container.,
Add several drops of food coloring to the salt and mix.,
Spread the salt out onto a cookie sheet.,
Bake the salt for several minutes.,
Allow the salt glitter to cool.",How to Make Salt Glitter2," To ensure that the salt glitter dries and the color sets, it helps to bake it in the oven. Set your oven temperature to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) and allow it to heat fully so it’s hot enough when you’re ready to dry the glitter.If you’re making the salt glitter with children, be sure to supervise their use of the oven.

, Decide how much glitter you would like to make, and pour the same amount of salt into a clean bowl or tupperware container. Keep in mind that you’ll need a separate bowl for each color of glitter that you want to make.You can use any type of salt, but regular table salt works well.
Make sure that the bowl or container you use is large enough for the amount of salt that you place in it. There should be enough room in the container to mix or shake the salt and coloring together.

, Once you’ve added the salt to the bowl or container, squeeze several drops of food coloring over the salt to achieve the desired shade. Use a spoon to carefully mix the salt and coloring together so they’re fully combined.The amount of food coloring that you’ll need depends on how much salt you’re coloring and what shade you want the glitter to be. Larger amounts of salt require more coloring, as do darker colors.
Be creative with the food coloring. You can mix two or more shades in a single batch of salt to create other shades. For example, if you don’t have green coloring, you can use equals amounts of blue and yellow to create a green shade.
If your bowl or container has a lid, you can place the lid on it and shake the salt and coloring to combine them.

, Once you’ve achieved the desired color for the glitter, carefully pour it out onto a cookie sheet or into a baking dish. Try to spread the glitter out in a single layer so it will dry more effectively.If you’re making multiple shades of glitter, it’s best to place them on separate cookie sheets. Otherwise, it can be extremely difficult to keep the glitter shades from mixing together when you remove them from the sheet.

, After you’ve spread the glitter onto the cookie sheet, place it in the preheated oven. Allow the salt to bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the food coloring dries completely., Once the salt has finished baking, remove the cookie sheet from the oven. Let the glitter cool completely, which should take approximately 20 to 25 minutes. When it’s cool, it’s ready for use.Once the salt glitter is cool, you can place it in jars or other storage containers.

Spoon some salt into sealable plastic bags.,
Add glow-in-the-dark paint to the salt.,
Close the bag and shake to mix the salt and paint.,
Pour the salt out onto a cookie sheet to dry.",How to Make Salt Glitter3," Open several sealable plastic bags, making sure that you have one for every shade of glitter that you plan to make. Carefully spoon some salt into the bags. The amount of salt equals the amount of finished glitter, so fill the bags accordingly.You can use whatever type of salt that you like, but epsom salt works especially well for glow-in-the-dark glitter.

, When the salt is in the bags, squirt several drops of non-toxic glow-in-dark-paint in the color of your choice into the bags. The paint is more pigmented than food coloring, so you usually don’t need to add very much. Larger amounts of salt may require more paint, though.Unlike the salt glitter made with food coloring, the glow-in-the-dark glitter is not edible.
If you can’t find glow-in-the-dark paint, you can use a neon formula.
While each bag of salt will be an individual shade of glitter, you can get creative and mix together two or more shades of paint to create a custom color.

, Once you’ve added the paint to the salt, shake the bags well to combine the ingredients thoroughly. It helps to squeeze the salt through the bag as you shake to make sure that it’s completely mixed.If the glitter isn’t as bright or vivid a color as you like, add more paint to the salt and shake the bag again. Repeat the process until you’re satisfied with the color.

, When the salt glitter is colored as you’d like, pour it out onto a cookie sheet, plate, or other flat item. Keep the salt in a single layer, and allow it to dry completely, which should take 4 to 6 hours. When the glitter is dry, you can use it.The salt may clump together with the paint. Don’t worry -- it will easily break apart once it’s dry.

Apply 1-2 light coats of the base coat spray provided in your kit, and leave the item to dry for one or two hours.Before applying the primer and base coat, use masking tape to block off any parts of the item that you do not wish to have an image printed on.

, Measure the size of the object you wish to cover and add 4-5 inches (approximately 12-15 cm) on each side. Cut the film accordingly. Make sure that the film remains dry during this process, as getting it wet could cause the image to warp.Place masking tape around the edges of the film to keep it from rolling.

, Fill the container with hot (but not boiling) water, approximately ¾ of the way full. Carefully pick up the film and bring the opposite sides together, holding it like a sling. Place the bottom of the sling onto the middle of the surface of the water, and slowly bring the sides down to place the film flat on the water. , Use your phone or a stopwatch to ensure that the film dissolves for sixty seconds. After the sixty seconds, spray the activator provided in your kit evenly over the film. Once coated, the film should take approximately 5-10 seconds to turn into liquid ink on the surface of the water. When the film is fully activated it will have a distinctly glossy appearance, and will expand to fill the entire surface size of the container.

, Hold your item at a 45 degree angle and slowly submerge it into the water. Once the item is fully submerged, even out the angle by pushing it down towards the ink. Keep your movements fluid for best results.Put on gloves before dipping your item. If they are not supplied in the kit, purchase a pair before starting the whole dipping process.

, Slowly remove the item from the water. Hold the item lightly and carefully, and avoid rubbing its surface. Rinse it under cold water immediately for approximately 3 minutes to remove any PVA residue., After air drying the item, apply an even coat of the aerosol top coat spray provided in your kit. Let the item air dry before applying a second coat. Continue the process until the finish is to your liking."

Gather what you need.,
Set up the painting area.,
Apply a base coat.,
Spray paint onto the water’s surface.,
Dip the object in the container of paint and water.,
Leave the object to dry.,
Use a clear, spray sealant.",How to Hydro Dip2," Begin the hydro dip process by deciding what you want to paint, then pick paint colors and find a water-tight container large enough to accommodate the object. You can use one color of spray paint, or several colors to swirl into cool designs with a disposable wooden stick. Purchase spray sealant (available at art stores or hardware stores) to seal your colorful design onto the object after hydro dipping, as well as protective gloves.The plastic container should be large enough that it won’t overflow if the object being painted is submerged in it. Buckets, large plastic storage containers, and feed tubs are all good options.
If you do not wish to get paint on the container you are using, line it with plastic sheeting before pouring in the water.

, If you can, set up outdoors (e.g. in your driveway or on the lawn) to avoid having your home smell like spray paint fumes. Make sure all of the items you will need are within arm’s reach, as the process of hydro dipping can go very quickly. Fill your container about ¾ full with lukewarm or warm water, as the ideal temperature for spray paint is between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit (approximately 10 to 32 degrees celsius).If you have to set up indoors, open as many windows and doors as possible and nearby furniture with plastic sheeting.
Make sure to keep children and pets away from the area while you paint.

, In the event that certain spots on the object do not get covered in paint when you dip it, apply a base coat color that will show through. Use spray paint to coat the entire surface of the object. Let it dry for 2-3 hours before you start the hydro dip process., Make sure to shake the spray paint cans thoroughly to mix the paint before applying it. Hold the can 10 to 12 inches (approximately 25-30 cm) from the surface of the water and spray it to your heart’s content until the surface is coated. Switch between colors as desired to make your own unique creation.Colors will swirl together naturally on the water’s surface. To make smaller swirls, use a clean wooden stick to stir the colors until you’re left with a design you like.

, Put on gloves and make sure that the object you are painting is free of dust or debris. Slowly dip it into the container until it is fully submerged. Slowly pull the object back out of the water.If you do not wish for the object you dipped to receive a second coat of paint on its way out of the water (which might alter the original swirl pattern of the paint), part the paint on the water’s surface before pulling the object out of the container. Having a second person to help you would be a big help for this step!

, Place the painted object on a plastic sheet or piece of cardboard to air dry. To make sure it is completely dry, let it sit for several hours before touching it. If you leave the object indoors to dry, make sure it is left somewhere safe where children or pets will not have access to it., To keep your hydro dip paint looking fresh and clean, spray it with a clear spray sealant (available in hardware stores in matte, semi-gloss, or gloss finish). Spray an even coat over the object and let it dry for several hours. Apply the sealant only after the object is completely dry."

Most transfer paper is the same size as your regular printer paper (Letter size or A4 depending on your country). Before purchasing an unusual size, make sure your printer can handle it.
Light transfer paper is used for light or white shirts. Dark transfer paper is used for any shirt that is darker.;
, You can use any image saved on your computer.









If you only have the image in a physical form, scan it and save it to your computer as a jpeg file. Alternatively, take a photograph and transfer it to your computer.

, Transfer paper for light-colored paper creates a mirror image on your shirt. Look for a ""reverse"" or ""mirror"" setting in the print options window, or flip your image in MS Paint or another image editing program. If you skip this step, all text in your design will be unreadable.









Do not reverse the image if you are using transfer paper for darker shirts. This type of transfer paper transfers the image exactly as it appears.
If you're not sure whether the reverse setting worked, print out a test piece on ordinary paper. It should come out as the mirror image of the look you want.

, Before printing, check the preview to confirm that the image fits onto your paper. If it's too large, select ""fit to scale"" in the print options, or scale it down in an image editing program.









When printing with your transfer paper, you need the right kind of printer like an Inkjet printer. If the two sides of your transfer paper look different, print onto the blank side. One side may have a logo, design, or thermal indicators on it.
Switch to ""landscape mode"" if the image is wider than it is tall.

, Any paper you leave around the image will show up as a thin film on the shirt. To create a clean image, cut out the image.









To get an accurate cut, use a ruler and an Exacto knife.

, Clear a table or countertop, then clean and dry it if necessary. Lay a cotton pillowcase over this surface, covering enough space to lay out the area of your T-shirt you'll be printing.









Most ironing boards are not suitable, due to the metal bars or grating on the surface.
Use a surface that can withstand heat. Don't try to iron over a laminate countertop. A cutting board can also work.

, Check the instructions that came with your transfer paper to find out which settings work best for your product. If no advice is listed, select the ""cotton"" or high-temperature setting; select ""dry"" or turn off the steam; empty all water out of the iron. Give the iron a few minutes to warm up.









For best results, use an iron with at least 1200 watts of power., Place the shirt over the pillowcase. Iron it until it is completely flat. Any wrinkles will show up in the transferred image.









Wash and dry the T-shirt first if necessary.

, If using transfer paper for light shirts, place the image face down. If using transfer paper for dark shirts, place the image faceup. Line up the center of the image with the center of your T-shirt neckline.









Placing the image face down will allow the image to be transferred so that it’s not a mirrored image when it gets transferred to your shirt.

, Press the iron firmly over the clothing, pushing down with your whole hand for significant pressure.









Iron from 30 seconds to several minutes, according to the instructions that came with your specific transfer paper.
Keep moving the iron and make sure to provide heat to every part of the paper.
Some types of transfer paper have thermal indicators that will change colors when the area is hot enough.

, Let it cool for at least a few minutes, until the paper reaches room temperature.









Peel off the paper to reveal your image underneath.

Gather the things you need to complete this project.",How to Make a Lace Print Shirt1," (See the Things You'll Need section below). Set them out to make sure you have everything ready. When obtaining the items, consider the following:


Reuse and recycle. Use a piece of lace off of an old piece of clothing that has ripped or is just old and needs to be retired. Whatever piece of lace you choose, make sure it can spread from one side of the shirt across to the other, measuring horizontally across the shirt.
Use any old solid colored shirt. Think ahead and decide in advance what color you want to spray paint. The colors should complement each other if you want it to look good. Keep in mind that opposite colors attract, dark colors look good on light colors, and dark colors work well with neons.

These kits usually supply you with everything you need to do your own transfers including image software, some transfer paper, and maybe even a t-shirt. You can opt to use these helpful craft store kits, or go the route of creating your own transfer images, buying the specific kind of paper you want, and using your own clothing.In a nutshell, iron-on transfers are images that can be impressed on fabric. On one side is paper, and on the other is the image that will be ironed on and transferred in reverse. After placing the transfer paper on the fabric and running over the back of the paper with an iron, the image is transferred by heat to the fabric.;
, Find or create an image you want to use for your transfer. You can scan an image into your computer, find one on the internet, or create one in a software program. For example, you can scan an image of your child's artwork to your computer, print it out on transfer paper, and transfer the image of the artwork to a t-shirt. Or, you can use applications like Photoshop to create a new and unique image yourself, print it on transfer paper, and transfer that image to some other type of fabric.


Make sure you don't use any old picture you might find on Google. You must have the rights to an image if you are going to reproduce it and sell it (like a t-shirt). If you do use Google, you can click Search Tools, then Usage Rights, then Labeled For Reuse. Also, there are many websites where you can find different kinds of images that are legally safe for you to use, transfer, and sell.Remember that transfer images that contain dark colors are usually going to show up on fabrics better than images with light colors. Also keep in mind that typical at-home printers don't print the color white; they leave that area blank because the printer assumes that the paper you are using to print your image is white, and the white paper will show through the image. If your image has white coloring in it, the iron on transfer will show up clear in that area, meaning the fabric color will show in that clear space rather than the color white.If you image has very light colored sections, those sections might appear discolored and distorted when ironed onto the fabric because of their light coloring mixing with the color of the shirt. Dark, solid colors provide the best looking results when using iron on transfers. The heavy colors contrast really well against fabrics and provide a darker, opaque color for the printer to print., Use basic image editing software, to resize your image, add effects, change colors, or make any corrections you want, until your image is just right. The image you use can be an image from one of the many internet sites that offer transfer image options, or an image you provide yourself. As long as you can print it from your printer at home (and have the legal rights to use that image), you can transfer the image onto your fabric.

, This is only required for images printed for light colored fabrics.Make sure you mirror your image so the finished product is facing the right way, rather than reading or appearing backward once ironed onto your fabric. To make sure you've flipped the image correctly, the image should look flipped on the computer screen before you print it out.


Flipping the image is really important if you have words on your transfer image. Without flipping it, you words will be transferred on backward to the fabric.
To mirror the image in your computer software, you may need to use a ""Reverse"", ""Flip Image Horizontally"", or ""Mirror"" commands. See the program's Help section for more information.

, Transfer paper comes in two different variations: transfer sheets to be used on light colored fabrics, and transfer sheets to be used on dark colored fabrics. Using the right kind of transfers sheets can help ensure that you get the best looking results from your iron on transfer. For example:


Transfer sheets meant to be used on light fabrics are meant for fabrics that are white, yellow, light gray, or any other fabric that is light in nature. The transfer paper used for light colored fabrics is transparent. This means any areas of your image that contain the color white will instead appear clear once ironed on to the shirt. The fabric color will show through rather than the white coloring of the image.If your transfer design has any light colors (other than white), the image may seem distorted and discolored once it is transferred onto the fabric. Try to use medium to dark colors when using this kind of transfer paper, so the resulting image is bold and clear.Consider trimming close to the edges of your design, because the transparent areas of the paper surrounding the design can still be seen on the fabric.
Transfer sheets meant to be used on dark fabrics are meant for black, dark gray, dark blue, or any other dark colored fabrics. These paper sheets are thicker, and have a white backing so the color white and other light colors can show up distinctly on the darker fabric. The caveat with using this kind of transfer paper is that any background areas of your image will appear white rather than translucent. This means you'll have to carefully cut around and inside any letters or other design elements if you want the color of the shirt to show through a certain spot rather than the color white.For example, if you were printing letters, you would need to cut out the space inside an 'O' or an 'R'. Or, you could have the solid white colored background as part of your design. However, more often than not, the white background isn't the intended look for using iron on transfers on dark fabrics.

, Before you print your transfer image onto the transfer paper, do a test run by printing your image on a regular piece of paper. This test run helps to make sure that the colors of the image are how you want them to look, see if your printer will print the entire image rather than cutting a section out, and to see the size of your image. Sometimes how your image looks on the computer screen is different than how it looks once it is printed.Make sure that you print the transfer on the correct side of the page. This should be clearly marked. Usually the printing side is free from any markings, and the back side has some design printed on it. If you're not sure on exactly how to insert the transfer paper into your printer, do a test run with a normal sheet of paper. Draw an X on one side of the normal paper and have it go through your printer to see what side of the paper gets printed on.If you are going to be printing your image on a laser printer, you will have to buy specific transfer paper for laser printers. Normally, inkjet printers work best when printing out transfer images., Place the t-shirt or fabric on a hard, flat surface, and smooth out the shirt with the iron if the shirt happens to be wrinkly. The surface you're ironing on should be heat resistant (unlike an ironing board) and should be large enough to be able to iron the entire area of the transfer.

, Trim around the transfer image so you know exactly what shape the image is, making it easier to accurately place it and position it on the fabric. You'll want to cut and stay as close to the edge of your design as possible. This will help make your transfer on image appear seamless.


If you're planning to iron on your transfer to a light colored fabric, you need to wait to peel the backing off of the transfer image until after it has been ironed on.
If you're planning on ironing your transfer onto a dark fabric, the backing of the transfer is going to be peeled off before you iron on the design. When in doubt, look at the instructions that come with the package of transfer paper., Place a piece of cardboard or a folded up brown paper bag inside the shirt directly underneath where the transfer image will be ironed on. Putting a barrier between the two pieces of fabric stops the the heat of the iron from transferring the image onto both sides of the t-shirt.

, Place the transfer image-side down on the fabric. Put the transfer on the fabric precisely where you want the image to be.

, Ironing on transfer images differs from normal ironing with an ironing board. Iron on transfers need a lot of direct heat, meaning using an ironing board wouldn't really be efficient since ironing boards help to spread out and diffuse heat. Ironing on hard surface like Formica or a wooden cutting board would be especially useful for doing iron on transfers because they are good at retaining heat.Set your iron to the hottest setting so it can transfer onto the fabric properly, but do not use steam. Steam can greatly hinder the transfer's ability to adhere to the fabric., Iron the image by moving the iron around in large circles on top of the transfer paper. Focusing initially on the outside edges of the image, and gradually work your way inward to the center of the image. Be sure to consistently apply pressure and iron for about 3 minutes. Keep the iron moving to prevent scorching the paper and burning the image.Check to make sure the edges of the transfer are fully attached before you move onto removing the backing paper. If the edges are not fully stuck to the fabric, continue to iron the edges of the transfer. Be sure to apply steady and even pressure as you iron so the complete image is fully attached.

, Turn off the iron when you're finished, and let the image cool down for a few minutes. If you take off the back of the transfer paper before the image is cool enough, you could disastrously mess up the image.

, You'll want to start at one of the paper's corners.

, Wait at least 24 hours after you've applied the iron on transfer before you wash your fabric. You can ruin the transfer if you wash the fabric before the image has time to completely set.Only wash and dry your fabric on a cool setting. If the transfer was done to clothing, turn the article of clothing inside out before you wash it. This adds a little bit more protection to your transferred on image. The more care you take with washing and drying, the longer your shirt will last.

, An alternative to washing your fabric in the washing machine is to wash it by hand. To ensure a gentle cleaning of your fabric, you can try hand washing it with some light detergent. Don't bleach your fabric. To dry your fabric, try hang drying it rather than using a drying machine. This gentle drying will help make your transferred image last longer.

, For extra protection against peeling, you can sew a border around the entire transfer image either with a machine or by hand. Higher quality paper should be less like to peel at the edges.

This printing method can only print black images onto the shirt. If you have a color image in mind, convert it into black and white using Microsoft Word, Photoshop, or another photo editing application.

, You can purchase acetate paper from specialized screen printing supply stores, but clear transparency sheets from office supply stores work fine. Print the image onto the transparency sheet. Low-quality printers may not make the image completely opaque, which can lead to a messy image on the shirt. If necessary, take the transparencies to a copy store instead.
Some transparency sheets will shrink or warp when they go through the printer. Buy a small pack to start with, so you can switch to a different brand if the first attempt doesn't work out.

, These materials are available online or at large craft stores, often as part of a single screen printing kit. Paint both sides of the screen with the photo emulsion, using a squeegee to spread it a thin, even layer across the whole surface.


Wear gloves while handling the photo emulsion.
You also may want to lay a garbage bag down so that you don’t get any paint on your table or another surface.
Cover an area slightly larger than your photo and spread the emulsion out evenly. You shouldn’t be able to see through the screen.

, Leave the screen in a dark, cool area. Allow several hours for the photo emulsion to dry.


Optionally, point a fan over the screen to speed up the drying process.

, The photo emulsion allows you to ""burn"" an image onto your screen when exposed to light. Clear a space for the screen under a bright source of light. Direct outdoor sunlight can work in the late morning or early afternoon.


Place a black garbage bag or cloth under your screen for best results.
Alternatively use a 150-watt incandescent bulb, or a specialized ""photo flood"" bulb for a shorter exposure time. You can purchase a specialized image burning machine for faster results.

, Set this up before you remove the screen from the dark room. Place these items on top of each other in the following order:A large piece of cardboard or a large tray.
A piece of black fabric, to reduce reflection.
The prepared screen with the flat side of the screen face up.
The transparency image, face down and attached to the screen with tape.
A sheet of clear glass, Lucite, or Plexiglass.

, The timing of this step is tricky to get right on your first try since it varies based on the intensity of the light. Typically, the image is ready once the photo emulsion has changed to a dull grey-green.


Check your photo emulsion product for instructions, since the timing can vary from 2 to 90 minutes depending on light intensity.

, Remove the glass and transparency and quickly bring the screen to the sink or a hose. Apply a powerful spray of cold water for several minutes to the recessed side of your screen. The ink on the transparency paper blocked light from reaching the photo emulsion, preventing it from hardening. Keep spraying until all of this wet emulsion has washed away, leaving an outline of your image.


If all of the emulsion washes away, try again with a longer light exposure.
If none of the emulsion washes away after several minutes, use a photo emulsion remover on the screen and try again with a shorter exposure.

, The screen is now a reusable printing device. Transfer the image onto your shirt by:


Placing a piece of cardboard or another barrier inside the shirt, to prevent bleeding through to the other side.
Add a small dollop of screen printing ink to the top of the screen, and pull it across with a squeegee to form a thin layer. Go over this several times to ensure an even layer.
Lift the screen without moving it against the shirt.

, Most screen printing inks need to be ironed onto the shirt at a hot, dry setting. Others may only require an hour in sunlight, or a quick run through an ultraviolet drying machine.


Check your ink label for specific instructions before you heat set.
Once the image has dried, your shirt is ready to wear!

Inkodye works best with cotton shirts so be sure to set your iron to the cotton setting.
Iron the shirt until you’ve removed all wrinkles, especially on and around the area you plan to print on.
Use a dry ironing method without steam.

, Place the cardboard inside your shirt and smooth out the area again.


Cardboard works well because it’s flat and won’t let the ink bleed through to the other side of the shirt. Plus, when you’re done, you can just throw it away.

, You can use a piece of cardboard or plastic frame that you’ve made or simply use blue painter’s tape to tape off the area.


The area inside your frame is where you’ll paint on the ink. The frame ensures that no ink gets outside of the area.
If you don’t want any extra inked area around your photo, use a frame that’s slightly smaller than your image. A smaller frame ensures that the ink won’t bleed out passed your photo.
Make sure not to tape the image down. It will get stuck. And run your fingernail along the taped edges if you used tape you ensure there are no gaps.

,


Make sure that your bowl isn’t absorbent, you don’t want the dye seeping into it.
Try to do this in a ventilated room that isn’t exposed to a lot of natural light.
About 2.5 tablespoons (40 ml) can coat an 11X11” cotton square.

, Coat your brush or roller with the dye. Use the edges of your bowl to get excess dye of your brush so there’s not dripping or blotting.


Evenly apply the dye to your desired area on your shirt. Don’t soak your shirt.
Inkodye is fairly colorless so pay close attention to how much you are applying.
After you’ve covered the desired area, grab a paper towel and blot the area to soak up any excess dye.

, Once you’ve covered the area you no longer need your frame.


You can keep the frame on if you used tape and you think some of the dye may have bled through.

, You can press down your negative onto your shirt to help it stick to the dyed area.


Smooth out the area with your hand. You want your negative to make good contact everywhere with the dye.
Use straight pins on the edges of your negative to keep it in place.
Alternatively, you can place a piece of acetate over the top of your negative.

, You now want to bring your shirt with the negative on it outside and let it soak up the sun to dry and transfer the image.


Expose your print to direct sunlight for 10-15 minutes.
It’s best to do this when the sun is strongest around 11:00 am to 3:00 pm.
You may have to expose your print for longer if it’s cloudy out.
After about five or so minutes you’ll begin to see the image darken.

, It’s best to remove the negative in a space that isn’t very bright.


Removing the negative in subdued lighting will help to keep the print intact.

, It’s best to wash your shirt in the washing machine, but you can hand wash it as well.


Washing will remove any extra Inkodye from your shirt and make your print look nice and fresh.
Use warm to hot water for best results.
You may want to wash it twice to remove all the residue.
After your shirt is clean, it’s ready to wear!

, The paper should act as a leak-proof barrier between the layers of the shirt. Attaching this can be tricky, because it's very easy to rip the wax paper. If the paper does rip, patch it up by taping a small piece of wax paper over the hole and pinning the shirt to that. That way, if that piece rips, you don't have to re-patch it but can simply remove the patch and replace it with a new one.

, Carefully pin the lace to the shirt, being extra careful not to rip the pattern in the lace at all. Putting it through an already created hole that works with the pattern is the best idea.

, Include about an inch (2.5cm) around the edge of the lace, though the width should vary, so as to give it a unique, messy looking edge. Make sure that you spray over the entire lace piece.

, Leave an edge of white around the lace pattern. For a retro, original look, vary the thickness of the paint––in some places it can be very thick, while in other places it can be so thin that you can partially see through to the white.

, If you don't let it dry for anywhere between an hour to an entire night, you'll have to start over completely.

, Either set it aside to reuse or throw it out. If you chose to reuse it, don't worry about the paint that's already on it transferring to another piece of clothing––as long as it's dry, it shouldn't do that.

, Leave it up overnight, at the very least. If you don't have a clothesline, you can use thick wire and if you don't have clothes pins, you can use a chip clip or large paper clip.

, You're bound to get lots of admiring comments!

Make dipped candles.",How to Add Color to Beeswax1," Beeswax candles can easily be dyed with crayons. Any type of crayon you can find at a supermarket, department store, or craft store should be fine Use a scale to weigh your beeswax and crayons. Use .5 of an ounce of crayon for every ounce of beeswax. Add the beeswax and crayons to a glass jar., Place your jar in a pot of hot water. Leave the beeswax in the water until it melts. If necessary, you can place the pot over the stove to melt the beeswax., To make molded candles, simply pour your melted beeswax into a mold. You can use molds you buy to make candles in specific shapes. You can also simply use something like a mason jar. Add a wick to the tip of the candle and set the mold aside until the beeswax hardens.The amount of time the candles needs to harden will vary, but most candles should harden within 24 hours.

, Tie a fishing weight to the end of a candle wick. Dip the weight into the melted beeswax. Give the wick a few moments cool before dipping it again. Repeat this process until your candles are as thick as you want them."

Choose your oils.,
Melt your oil, beeswax, and butter.,
Prepare your colors.,
Adjust your colors.,
Mix in your colors.,
Add your beeswax to molds.",How to Add Color to Beeswax2," To make beeswax lipstick, beeswax should be mixed with butter and oil. The oil you choose affects how your product turns out, so select your oil carefully.Cocoa butter is a good choice as its inexpensive. It also helps add strength to lip balm, making it easier to mold.
Liquid oils, like castor and soybean oil, tend to make a shinier lip gloss.

, Measure out 30 grams of beeswax, 26 grams of butter, and 44 grams of oil. Place them in a saucepan and heat them over the stove until they melt.You can leave the beeswax mixture alone while it melts, but make sure to check it periodically.

, Lip safe micas can be purchased online or at a craft store. Mix these together using the kit the micas come with while your beeswax melts. Place your colors in plastic bags and mix them until they form a paint-like liquid., Take a q-tip and a piece of scrap paper. Test your color by dipping the q-tip in the colors and then making marks with your colors on the scrap paper. Mix small amounts of black or white micas into your colors to lighten and darken them to your liking. Black will make your colors darker while white will make them lighter., Once the wax is melted and you have the colors you want, you can color your beeswax. Use 5 to 10% of your mica color blend to your beeswax base. For example, 10 grams of beeswax would require about .5 grams of mica. Stir in the mica using a spoon., Once your color is mixed in, pour your beeswax mixture to tubes. You can buy tubes for lip gloss online or at a craft store. Fill each tube to the brim with the beeswax mixture. Then, set the tubes aside for a few hours to allow your colorful lip balm to harden."

Melt your resin and beeswax.,
Place your molds in cans.,
Fill cans with pigment.,
Place your bricks in molds.",How to Add Color to Beeswax3," To make molds with beeswax, you will need resin which you can purchase online or at a craft store. Resin helps protect beeswax from heat damage during the melting process. Mix one part resin with eight parts beeswax in a can. Place the can in a pot filled with hot water until the mixture melts.So your colors come out as vibrant as possible, use white or bleached beeswax.

, Once your beeswax is melted, pour it into cans. You can divide the beeswax evenly or use more or less beeswax depending on how many molds you want in a particular color., You can buy pigments online or at a craft store. To get the color you want, simply mix pigments in with the beeswax until you get your desired color. Start with a small amount of beeswax and add the pigment gradually until it changes to the color you want., You can buy molds online in your desired shape. Pour the beeswax mixture into the molds. Allow the beeswax to sit until it hardens. Times will vary depending on the size and shape of your mold."

Gather your supplies.,
Measure out your colorants.,
Melt the wax.,
Pour the wax.,
Mold the crayons.,
Repeat the process.",How to Make Crayons1," Making crayons with carnauba wax will yield a smooth, hard crayon. You can add a little beeswax to get a more traditional crayon.Carnauba wax is also known as palm wax and can be purchased online. You will need about 8-10 grams per crayon.In addition to the wax, you will also need a colorant of some kind. You can use earth pigments, chalk, or cosmetics to color your crayons. Earth pigments and cosmetic pigments can be purchased online. If you are using chalk, simply choose your colors and grind the chalk into a fine powder.Make sure you have an old saucepan to melt the wax in. Find a mold for your crayons, such as a silicone ice stick tray. Your mold should make a crayon about .5 inches (1.3 cm) in diameter. If your crayon is too thin, it may break.Get 2-3 disposable cups per color of crayon, and have a few extra set aside. Keep some disposable stirring sticks next to the cups. Make sure you have as many sticks as you do cups.;
, Decide how many colors you plan on making, and measure out 2-3 grams of each pigment. Put the pigment into disposable cups before you melt the wax to make the mixing process easier. Use one pigment per disposable cup. The only limit to the number of colors you can make is the amount of pigment and wax you have. The amount of pigment you use will determine how vibrant the crayon color is.Make sure you measure out all colors of pigment before you start. Carnauba wax will harden quickly once it is removed from the heat, so prepare as much as you can ahead of time., Place all the carnauba wax into a saucepan and melt it over low heat. Once the wax is completely melted, reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting.If you decide to add any beeswax to your crayons, wait until the carnauba is completely melted. Grating the beeswax before adding it will aid in the melting process. For a more traditional crayon, aim for a ratio of 90% carnauba and 10% beeswax., Add a few tablespoons of wax into one of the cups and place the saucepan back onto the heat. Working quickly, stir the wax in the cup to mix the colorant.It does not take long for carnauba wax to harden, so it may help to have two people for this project. Have one person pour the wax, and one person immediately mix the pigment and the wax together.
For a fun addition, try adding a few drops of essential oils to your wax as you mix the pigment in. Find scents that match the colors. For example, use orange oil for an orange crayon, or rose oil in pink or red., As soon as the wax takes on the color of the pigment, begin pouring it into your molds. Silicone ice stick trays work well for a standard crayon shape.Set the molds aside and let the crayons harden for at least 2 hours at room temperature., Work through each color by pouring a few tablespoons of melted wax into the cups one at a time. Quickly mix the wax and the colors together and pour it into your molds.If you have any difficulty with the wax hardening before you can get it set in a mold, flake the wax off and set it aside. Carnauba wax is easy to remelt. Try mixing some of your colored waxes together to create interesting new colors."

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare the soap and the beeswax.,
Melt the soap and beeswax together.,
Add color.,
Mold your crayons.",How to Make Crayons2," You can buy beeswax online or at craft stores, usually in 1 lb blocks. Use a plain white bar of soap for this project. You will need equal amounts of beeswax and soap. To make your crayons you will need the following:1 part beeswax
1 part soap
Liquid food dye
A microwave safe container, or double boiler
A cheese grater
A knife
A mold, such as a silicone ice stick tray or muffin pan
Non-stick spray or shortening

, Chop the beeswax into manageable pieces to help it melt faster. Use a cheese grater to grate the soap., Place the chopped beeswax and the grated soap into a microwave safe container. Put the container in the microwave and melt the soap and wax together. Heat the mixture in one minute intervals and watch it closely. Make sure the mixture doesn't foam. Foam will add air bubbles to your crayons.You can also melt the soap and wax in a double boiler. Get a medium sized stock pot and fill it with water. Put the pot onto a burner over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Put the soap and beeswax into a smaller saucepan and place it on top of the pot of boiling water. Stir constantly and make sure the mixture does not foam over.If you do get air bubbles, let the mixture sit for a few minutes. Gently stir to remove any bubbles., Once you have melted the beeswax and the soap, you can add your liquid food color. The more color you add, the more vibrant your crayons will be.If you want to make multiple colors, divide the hot wax and soap mixture into equal parts. Add different colors to each portion., Spray your molds with non-stick spray or grease them lightly with shortening. You can use silicone trays, muffin pans, or even make your own molds out of foil paper or clay.Pour the wax mixture into your molds and let them harden. It could take a few days for the crayons to set completely."
"
Gather your supplies.,
Melt the wax and tallow.,
Mix in your pigments.,
Pour the colored wax into a mold.",How to Make Crayons3," If you have concerns that your children may try to eat crayons, try making them from food grade ingredients. These crayons use a blend of carnauba wax and tallow for the base.Use powdered herbs and veggies, and spices to make your colors. Use turmeric for yellow, beetroot powder for pink, and chlorella for green. Once you get the hang of making the crayons, experiment with different combinations to make new colors.You can buy tallow online or in the grocery store, or you can make your own. If you can't find tallow, you can substitute cacao butter, just make sure it is food grade., Add 1 oz of carnauba wax and 1.5 oz of tallow to a double boiler and melt. If you don't have a double boiler, you can melt the waxes together in a stainless steel bowl over a pot of boiling water., When the wax and tallow are melted completely, add in your pigments. Keep the mixture on a low heat as you whisk in your colors.To make pink, use 5 teaspoons of beetroot powder.To make yellow, use 1.25 teaspoons of turmeric.To make orange, use 1.25 teaspoons of ground annatto.Use 1.25 teaspoons of chlorella powder to make a deep green., Use a silicone ice stick mold to form your crayons. You can also use a mold with fun shapes, such as stars or gingerbread men.You may find that some of the mixtures leave a small amount of sludge at the bottom of the pan. This is the result of the powders settling. Discard this part of the mixture. Adding it to your crayon will make the crayons gritty and uneven.Let the crayons set completely before using them. Carnauba wax hardens quickly, so the crayons should only take a few hours to set."

Buy animal fat.,
Grind the fat.",How to Make Wax1," Tallow wax is usually made from beef suet, the fat located next to the cow's kidneys and liver. Suet is mostly clean of gristle and other animal bits.









You can buy an animal fat other than beef suet, but the process might be messier, and it could smell.
The process of making wax from suet is time-consuming, so you may want to make a lot at once. Five pounds of fat makes a good amount of wax; buy more if you need more wax, or cut it down if you don't want that much.;
, The suet will be melted down, and that process is much faster when you start with fat that is ground, rather than melted whole or in large chunks.

Ask the butcher to grind the fat for you if you are unable to buy it ground.
You can grind the fat at home in a grinder or a food processor. Grind it as fine as possible, since smaller bits of fat melt the fastest.

"
"
Place the fat in a large pot and cover it with water.,
Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat.,
Strain the fat.,
Lift the colander out of the bowl.",How to Make Wax2," The pot you choose should be big enough to comfortably hold all of the fat and be filled to the top with water.









A dutch oven or large stew pot should be the right size for this purpose.
Consider choosing a pot that you will dedicate to tallow-making in the future. The process of melting fat and creating tallow will leave a waxy residue on the pot that is hard to clean off, so you may not be able to use it again for cooking.

, Slowly bring the water and fat to a boil. When it begins to boil, reduce the heat and let it simmer.









The fat should melt slowly; don't boil it until it's melted.
You can put a lid on the pot to speed things up, but don't leave it covered during the entire melting process. The production of steam could slow the melting process.
Each pound of fat will require approximately 10 minutes of simmering time. Therefore, if you use 5 pounds as recommended, plan on cooking the fat for around 50 minutes to 1 hour.

, As the fat melts, it will separate from the tallow and become liquid fat that needs to be strained. Place a large piece of cheesecloth inside a colander set over a large metal bowl. Pour the liquid into the cheesecloth-lined colander to strain the fat from the tallow and water.









Be very careful during this process, since the melted fat will be hot and might splatter.
There may be bone fragments or other solids in the fat that require removal. These should be strained out with the fat.

, Set the animal fat aside to be discarded. The liquid in the bowl now contains tallow and water.








"
"
Let the tallow cool.,
Remove the wax from the bowl.,
Store the wax.",How to Make Wax3," As it does, it will rise to the surface of the water. When it is completely cooled, it will form a hard white disc on the water's surface.









Cover the bowl with a piece of cling film to prevent possible accidents during this cooling period.
Consider placing the bowl in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process.

, The hardened wax should lift easily from the bowl in one or two pieces. Carefully release the wax from the bowl and rinse it with cold water. The liquid remaining in the bowl can then be discarded.









The wax may be sticky on the side that was facing the water. Use an old knife or metal can to scrape it off and throw it away.
Don't pour anything that touched the wax, including the water, down the sink. The wax residue can clog the pipes. Strain the water through a cheesecloth and pitch it outside, then throw the cheesecloth and wax away.

, You can store the wax whole or cut it into smaller pieces. Place the wax in a clean Ziploc and store it in the freezer for up to 30 days. Label the outside of the bag to prevent possible confusion.

If you are a kid, ask an adult to help you with this step.;
, Use thick and thin rubber bands for an interesting effect. Place some at angles, and cross others. Make some closer together than others., Use a paintbrush to get a thick coat of paint over both the cardboard and the rubber bands. You can use acrylic paint or tempera paint.

, Smooth the cardboard down with your hands. The cardboard and rubber bands will press up against the paper , creating an interesting effect., The rubber bands will be stamped against the paper. Some of the cardboard between the rubber bands may also be visible.

, Let the paint dry first, then flip the cardboard over and paint the back using a contrasting color. Press the cardboard down onto the paper again, then lift it away.Try to off-set the cardboard this time, or turn it in the other direction.

Melt wax over medium heat with a double boiler or large pot.,
Remove wax from heat and add fragrance scent.,
Carefully dip and soak the bear until it’s fully drenched.,
Squeeze out the excess wax from your bear.,
Shape and pose your bear while wet with care.,
Leave your cute little bear to harden.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make Organic Soy Wax Dipped Teddy Bears," Pour wax flakes into a tall pot or double boiler over medium heat and allow the wax flakes to completely melt while stirring often. It helps to break up the wax with a whisk or utensil when it starts to condense at the bottom of your pan. This will help speed-up the melting process. Do not allow the wax to reach above 140 °F (60 °C) and always wear thick rubber gloves to protect your hands.;
, Once the wax is melted and ready to use, it will become a translucent liquid.


Allow the wax to rest for 5 minutes. Then add scent into the wax and stir gently with a whisk or stirring utensil. Do not wait longer than 5 minutes before dipping your bear into soy wax and scent mixture. You do not want wax to cool too much and become hard.
The recommended balance is 1oz of dipping scent per 2-lb of wax dipping flakes.

, Prior to dipping the bear in the wax, remove all tags and bows. Then using tongs remove most of the air from your bear by lightly pushing it against the bottom of the pan and then allowing it to soak up the wax.


Make sure that your bear is completely saturated with the wax mixture from top to bottom and all sides. Give yourself a couple minutes to complete this step. This step does require rubber gloves to protect your hands from the hot wax.

, Squeeze the excess wax back into the pot by holding your bear over the pot of wax; squeeze the bear from head and work downward to the feet. Repeat this action until the desired amount of wax is removed from the bear.

, Place your bear on an inexpensive cooling rack with a shallow pan or baking sheet underneath to catch the wax drippings and to prevent excess wax from building up at the bottom of the bear. It helps to place the rack over your pan or sheet to conserve the wax for later use.


Position your bear in an erect sitting position and if needed, place a toothpick under his chin and gently press into his chest to hold his head up while he is drying. Pose his arms and legs in a position of your liking.
Once, the wax dries, the bear will become stiff and his body position will be permanent. You have approximately 15-30 minutes before the wax starts to stiffen. If you are using a larger bear, use a doll stand to hold the bear upright.

, Your bear’s foundation will be completely hardened after allowing it to dry for up to 1 hour depending on the temperature and humidity of your location. The higher the humidity and temperature, the longer it may take for the bear to harden. Ideally, it is best to be in an air conditioned location. The bear should be able to hold its pose before proceeding to the next step.

, Remove any toothpicks or doll stands from the bear and add the finishing touches with a warm hairdryer on low setting. This will remove any wax dandruff and produce a softer feel. The wax should just slightly melt on the bear's hair endings while you perform this process.


This is also a good time to groom your bear by using a toothpick and fluff up the bear’s fur one last time by gently using the hair dryer to soften on a small section at a time, then gently picking out his fur where the wax looks matted or thick. Allow bear to dry completely again before moving.
Place any bows or accessories back on your little bears. Use a wax-proof doily to place your bear on permanently. This will prevent any excess wax from staining surfaces and protect furniture.

Let the paint dry before removing the rubber bands.",How to Do Rubber Band Printing2," Something around 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) square would be ideal, but you can make it any size you want. Plan ahead, however; you need to be able to wrap the paper around the cardboard.


Use a craft blade to cut the cardboard. If you're a kid, get an adult to help you.

, You can use basic printer paper for this, but watercolor paper would be better. The paper needs to be big enough to cover the cardboard.It's okay if it is a little smaller than the cardboard, however.

, You want the rubber bands to be pinning the paper against the cardboard. Play around with different thicknesses of rubber bands. Place some straight up-and-down, and a few others sideways. You can even place some at angles to make crisscrosses.

, Pour some liquid watercolor paint into a cup or a clean, plastic container. Dilute it with some water.How much water you use is up to you; the more water you add, the lighter the color will be. You can also mix your own by filling a cup with water, then adding a few drops of food coloring into it.


Prepare a few different colors to make your print look more interesting.
You can also use straight tempera or acrylic paint. You don't need to mix those with water.

, Dip the sponge into the paint, then squeeze the excess out. Carefully dab the paint onto the paper. Do not drag it across the paper, or you may get paint under the rubber bands and ruin the resist effect.Make sure that you cover the entire paper, from edge-to-edge.


You can use all one color, or you can use different colors for a tie-dye effect.
If you are using more than one color, be sure to rinse the sponge in water, or switch to a new sponge.

, You can use the same colors and patterns, or you can use a different one.

, Once the paint has dried, pull or cut the rubber bands off. Slip the paper off of the cardboard, and unfold it to reveal your design.You can also cut your paper along the fold to get two designs.

Press the block down onto a sheet of paper, like a stamp.,
Repeat the design as often as you like until the paper is covered.",How to Do Rubber Band Printing3," Wooden blocks, pieces of cardboard, or small, cardboard jewelry boxes work great for this. Whatever you choose needs to be smaller than your cut rubber bands. This is because you will be gluing the rubber bands on top of the base, not stretching them., Think ahead about your design, then cut apart as many rubber bands as you need. You can use all the same width, but your design will look more interesting if you use both thick and thin rubber bands., Arrange the rubber bands on your base. Play around with different widths. Try to use both thick and thin rubber bands. You can do simple stripes or diagonals. You can also create more interesting designs, such as chevron, zigzags, diamonds, or weaves. Try to leave behind some negative space on the block.You may need to cut some rubber bands shorter so that they fit your design.

, You can use tacky glue or white school glue. Super glue may also work, but not hot glue. Let the glue dry before moving on., Acrylic paint will work best here, but you can also use tempera. You can use all one color, or experiment with different ones.

, You can use plain white paper or even colored paper. White paint on brown packaging paper will give you a nice, rustic effect.

, You can repeat the pattern over and over, or you can rotate the stamp for an interesting look. You should be able to stamp a few times before the paint becomes too pale. When that happens, simply apply more paint.

Pick the fabric.,
Lay the wax paper underneath the fabric.,
Create a design on the fabric with the liquid glue.,
Let the glue dry overnight.,
Paint the fabric.,
Allow the paint to dry.,
Rinse off the glue with warm water.,
Let the resist print dry overnight.",How to Do Resist Printing1," You may choose a fabric like cotton or muslin for the resist printing. Avoid heavy fabrics like wool or slick fabrics like silk. Go for a fabric that is white or very light in color so the print stands out more.;
, Take your chosen fabric and place wax paper underneath it to protect the surface you are working on. Lay the wax paper and the fabric down on a flat, high surface, such as a table. Make sure the wax paper lines the fabric so no glue or paint gets on the surface you are working on., Use clear glue that is washable. Hold the glue steady as you draw out designs on the fabric. You may do a pattern with lines, circles, spirals, or shapes. Or you may try a chevron or floral pattern. The design you make with the glue will be the design that is resist printed onto the fabric.Do not let the glue get too thick on the fabric. Try not to use too much glue on the fabric, as this can lead to a blurry design.

, Once you have created the designs on the fabric with the glue, let the glue set overnight. Place the fabric in a safe spot where it will not be touched so it can dry.If you are using clear glue, it should appear clear when it dries.

, Lay out the fabric with the glue designs and put out craft paints and paint brushes. Pick out colors that you think will look good with the designs. Then, brush the paint right over the glue, onto the fabric. Cover the entire piece of fabric with paint, creating a background color for the glue designs. Blend colors if you’d like or use just one color. Get creative and paint the designs as you see fit.Use acrylic or water based paints for the designs. Avoid using oil based paints, as they will not dry well.
Try not to layer on the paint too thickly over the glue, as this can distort the design. Stick with one to two light coats of paint on the fabric.

, Giving the paint time to dry will make it easier for you to rinse off the glue later. Determine the drying time based on how you want the colors to appear. If you want the paint colors to appear darker on the fabric, you should let the fabric dry for longer.If you want the paint colors to appear more subdued, let them dry until they are damp to the touch. Then, rinse them off while they are still slightly wet.

, Once the paint has dried to your liking, place the fabric under warm running water and gently rinse off the glue. It may feel a bit slimy but that’s okay, that is to be expected. Rinse until the glue slides off the fabric.Do not rub or scrub at the fabric, as this can damage it. Instead, let the glue melt and slide off on its own.

, Leave your prints out overnight to dry on a flat surface.


You can frame the prints and hang them as wall art. Or you may use the prints to make pillowcases for your couch. You can also use the prints as dish towels or placemats.

Rinse and dry the fabric.,
Boil off the wax.,
Wash and dry the fabric.",How to Do Resist Printing2," Start with fabric that has been pre-washed and ironed so it is easy to work with. It will also absorb dyes better if it has been pre-washed. Select fabric that is white or very light in color.Use fabrics made with natural fibers like cotton, muslin, hemp, or rayon. Avoid fabrics like wool or silk, as they can be difficult to print on with the wax method.

, To make the resist printing process easier, put newspaper or wax paper down on a flat surface, like a table. Then, secure the fabric over the table with tape, pins, or staples. Make sure the fabric is taut over the table so it does not move around when you apply the wax.If you do not want to get wax or dye on your hands, you can put on medical gloves at this point.

, Batik wax is made especially for resist printing. You can find Batik wax online or in craft stores. Regular wax should work fine too as long as it contains no dyes. Melt the wax in the metal pot until it is a liquid.Stir the wax as it melts so it does not get too hot or burn. Leave the wax on low so it does not come to room temperature and get hard again while you are resist printing.

, Once the wax has melted, take the paintbrush and dip it into the wax. Then, apply it to the fabric in whatever designs you would like. Make dots, circles, lines, spirals, or shapes on the fabric to create a pattern. Do not put too much wax onto the fabric. Apply one to two layers of wax at a time.You can also make fun shapes or patterns on the wax with tools like a potato masher, a chopstick, or any other object with an interesting texture.
Make sure the wax appears clear on the fabric and has penetrated the other side of the fabric. If the wax appears yellow and sits at the top of the fabric or spreads out on the fabric, the wax is not the right temperature. It should not be too hot or too cool.

, Once you have made as many patterns and designs on the fabric as you’d like, let the wax dry overnight on the fabric. Put the fabric is a safe spot so the wax can set., When the wax has dried, dye the fabric in the colors of your choice. You can use a bucket or your sink to dye the fabric using natural dyes. You can also use the washing machine to dye the fabric.Start with the lightest or brightest color first for the pattern. Then, choose a darker color that will mix well with the first color. The lightest color will show up on the waxed areas and the darker color will be the main color on the fabric.
For example, you may start with yellow dye as the first dye bath. Then, you may use turquoise as the next dye bath. This will mix with the yellow to make a green background color on the fabric.

, After you have dyed the fabric, rinse out the fabric and hand wash it in lukewarm water. The lukewarm water will ensure the wax does not melt. Then, air dry the fabric.

, To remove the wax, fill a large pot with water and a few drops of liquid detergent. Bring the water to a simmer and put in the fabric. Weigh the fabric down with something heavy, such as a rock or a kitchen tool. Then, let the water come to a boil.The wax will then slide off the fabric and float to the top of the water. When all the wax floats to the surface, remove the fabric from the pot.

, Wash the fabric one more time in the washing machine to remove any residual dye. Dry the fabric in the dryer or hang it to air dry."

Iron the fabric.,
Secure the fabric on a table.,
Soak the sponge in the fabric paint or dye.,
Press the printing block into the sponge.,
Apply the printing block to the fabric.,
Let the fabric dry.,
Iron or rinse the fabric to set it.",How to Do Resist Printing3," To do block printing, it is important that you start with fabric that is very flat and has no creases or marks. Iron the fabric you are using for the resist printing. You may use cotton or muslin fabric for this project.Avoid using thick fabrics like wool and acrylic as well as slick fabrics like nylon and silk. Block prints do not usually show up well on these types of fabrics.
Pick white fabric or fabric in a light color so the block prints show up better. If you are using lighter coloured dyes, you may be fine to use a darker coloured fabric.

, When doing block printing on fabric, it is very important that you secure the fabric on a flat surface. This way, the fabric will not move around or shift while you are printing. You can use a wooden table to stretch the fabric over and secure it with tape or staples. Make sure the fabric is taut over the table and does not move around.For more support under the fabric, you can layer carpet or foam over the table and then place the fabric over these layers. Secure the fabric well with tape, staples, or pins.

, Squeeze the fabric paint or dye into a bowl. Then, soak the sponge in it so the dye covers one side of the sponge. Make sure one side of the sponge is covered with the paint or dye.If you are using natural dyes that can stain your fingers, wear gloves to prevent this.
Another option is to take a paint brush and paint the dye over the sponge to cover it.

, Make sure the color covers the entire printing block. Press the sponge onto the block as many times as needed to get dye on the printing block.You can buy printing blocks online or in craft stores. Look for printing blocks made of wood or rubber.

, Hold the printing block with your fingertips and press it firmly onto the fabric. Use your palm or your fingers to apply even pressure. Hold the block on the fabric for a few seconds and then carefully remove it.Sponge dye onto the same printing block and press it on a new spot on the fabric to create a pattern. Or use a different colored dye on the same printing block. Make sure you wash the printing block between colors so the dyes do not mix.
You can also apply different print blocks on the same piece of fabric. Get creative and make up your own patterns or designs.

, Once you have done as many print blocks as you’d like, let the fabric dry overnight. Put it in a safe flat area where it will not be touched., If you used textile paints to do the block printing, iron the fabric on the reverse side to set the print. If you used natural dyes for the block printing, iron on the reverse side and rinse the fabric in warm and then cold water with detergent."

Get an idea in your head of what kind of mosaic you would like to make.,
Head over to your local hardware or floor store and select and buy the tiles you would like to use.,
With your safety glasses and protective gloves on, throw your tiles at any hard object, or simply drop them.,
Gather your broken tiles into color categories.,
Now it comes time to make the mosaic.,
Take your pieces and slide them into the wooden frame (if not already there).,
Now, individually glue each piece into place with the tile adhesive.








,
Once the tiles have set, mix up the cement with water until it is of the consistency described on the cement bag (liquid but not runny).,
Using a soft cloth, rub off the excess cement that covers the tile pieces.








,
You now have a beautiful Mosaic!








",How to Make a Mosaic from Broken Tiles," Sketch a basic drawing of what you would like it to look like when it finishes. This can be as detailed as you want, but it just has to give you a guide.






;
, This includes color and texture, or anything that you like. You could also go dumpster diving to find old tiles. These should be ceramic. (If your mosaic will be used where it may be subjected to freezing temperatures, the tiles should be porcelain that is frost resistant.) You may want to purchase a tile cutter if you are looking for a dramatic, organized mosaic with square pieces. You should also buy some tile adhesive and cement.








, In order to avoid major scratches, lay a thin comforter over the ground. Or score and cut with the tile cutter. These are great stress relievers and they don't hurt anyone.








, This will help you when the time comes to actually put them into place.








, When you have all of your broken tile pieces, lay them onto the surface that you will decorate. Again, this can be anything at all.








, They might scatter a little, but if you are careful, it should not be too bad. Slide the attempted escapees back into place.








,, Now put the cement/water mix over all the tiles.

Get your supplies.,
Sort the crayons out.,
Hot glue each crayon in order on the top of your canvas.,
Slant the canvas so that the wax will drip.,
Use your blow dryer and blow the crayons.,
Let your work dry.








,
Add final details.,
Display your artwork!",How to Make Melted Crayon Art1," You will need a canvas (your choice of size), crayons (your choice depending on the size of the canvas), a hot glue gun, and a hair/blow dryer. You'll probably want to lay newspaper or an old t-shirt or blanket under the canvas in case the wax splatters, too.


Whatever area you think will get messy, cover up a bit more on each side. Don't forget to cover up yourself too! Hot colored wax on your skin and nice clothes shouldn't be part of this project.;
, Sort depending on what you want. A rainbow is a popular design, so if you choose it, place the crayons in the order of the rainbow. Some people order their crayons lightest to darkest, others use different shades of the same color. The arrangement is totally up to you.


Just make sure you have enough to cover the entire top of the canvas. Repeating colors is just as beautiful.

, Some people keep the wrappers on and some take them off, but either way works.









You can opt to unwrap the crayons and cut them in half. This makes it look more natural and keeps the top three inches of your canvas from being obviously lined with crayons.

, A common idea is to lean it against a wall. If you do lean it against a wall, tape newspaper onto the wall to avoid any accidents.

, It's best to point the blow dryer downwards so that the wax will drip. Take note that this will get messy! However, it doesn't really matter how messy it gets, as long as your newspapers are laid out correctly.









You can use birthday candles for quicker melting. It's a bit more dangerous and the candle wax drips everywhere, too. If you'd rather be messy than pressed for time, a candle might be a better bet for you.
A heat gun is also a quicker alternative and can be picked up at most craft supply stores.

,, Clean up your work. Remove the crayons and collect all the dried bits of wax that have seeped onto less than desirable areas. Color in whatever you want to if desired.

, Hang it up on the wall, post it on Facebook or Tumblr, call over a family member. Show your creativity to the world; they'll love it! The kids will, too!

"
"
Grab your canvas.,
Place a crayon into the glue gun.,
Color your canvas.,
Let dry.",How to Make Melted Crayon Art2," Prop it up against a wall or a chair lined with a towel. Some area that you're not concerned about getting messy. Choose a size of canvas that you think you can cover with the amount of crayons you have.

, Unwrap the crayons of your choice, shave them down to size (in order to fit), and place one into the glue gun.









If you want to use multiple colors, once you've placed the first crayon into the glue gun, start pushing in the second, then third and so out - this will force crayon in front of it out .

, With this method, you have the ultimate power of color control; it'll go wherever you want. You could keep to the standard drip look or create shapes and designs. Put the gun tip close to the canvas and create away!









Once you have nothing to push in, add another crayon. You'll see the color coming out of the tip slowly lighten or darken as the next crayon gets ready to take the spotlight.

, That was a lot quicker than blow drying, huh? If you think your glue gun is salvageable, insert a regular glue stick and work through until what comes out is clear and glue-y and no longer colored and waxy.


If you aren't happy with a section of your painting, with this method it's very easy to go back and redo (or add to) an area.

Select the material you wish to use.,
Pick the foundation to adhere the mosaic tiles on.,
Find a pattern you wish to make into a mosaic.








,
Transfer the design to your base.,
Mix mortar per manufacturer recommendations.,
Let the mortar set.,
Prepare the grout mixture.,
Apply the grout using a spatula.,
Let the grout set for 20 minutes, or the time advised by the manufacturer.,
Seal the mosaic with varnish.",How to Do Mosaics," Pieces of material used in a mosaic art are called tesserae. They can be glass, stones, porcelain, seashells, or anything else you can find. You will also want to gather together any objects you might want to include.






;
, Tables, planters, birdbaths, or walking stones are just a few ideas to use.








,, Lay it on a flat surface and rough lay the tesserae. Use glass or tile cutting tools to cut pieces to the desired size. You can also use a hammer to break pieces as well. Make sure the pieces are clean of any dirt or debris before laying them out.








, Apply it to the foundation using a trowel or spatula. While still wet, gently affix the mosaic tiles by pushing them into the mixture. Apply tiles starting in one corner of the design and work across in rows. Make sure you leave enough space between pieces for grout. You may also choose to put the mortar directly on the tile as if you are buttering it like a piece of toast. Apply the buttered piece directly to the foundation and press down to affix it in place.








, Time varies depending on usage, so follow manufacturer recommendations. For pieces in your home, the timing is roughly 24 hours. Outdoor mosaics will need to set for 72 hours. Clean the mosaic tiles once more to clear away any extra mortar that may have risen to the top.








, Grout comes in many colors and there are colors you can add to the grout to change the coloring. Choose a color that accents your mosaic. Mix the grout by following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.








, Fill in the creases between the tiles. The grout should cover the mosaic enough to fill the gaps.








, Wipe the mosaic with a clean sponge and warm water. Rinse out the sponge regularly as you wipe away grout from the surface of the tiles.








, This will coat the tiles and safeguard against damage, especially for outdoor mosaics subjected to fluctuating temperatures and adverse weather conditions. It also will give a high gloss shine that will make the colors stand out.

Find a suitable glass container.,
Cut the tiles.,
Begin to glue the tiles to outside of container.,
Allow the glue to dry.,
Apply the grout.

,
Use a damp, flat sponge to apply sanded grout to the glass.

,
Push the grout between the glass pieces.,
Keep the sponge completely flat and begin wiping the grout off the surface.,
Allow to dry for 24 hours.

,
Clean the tiles with cotton balls and alcohol.",How to Create a Glass Mosaic Vase,";
, Another option would be to use coloured glass, which gives a colourful effect to the final result.


Optionally you can get a rag or towel, place the tile underneath the rag and hit it with a hammer.
Cut with the tile nippers to fit together. Fitting tiles together is similar to puzzle-making. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to make a design or a pattern to stick the tiles.

, Make sure tiles are placed 1/8"" to 1/16"" apart. This gives the vase a more finished look.

, The amount of time the glue takes to dry depends on the type you're using.

,,, You will completely cover the design to fill the spaces between the glass tiles.

, It will be a process of rinsing the sponge, wringing it out to get as much water as possible out of the sponge, and then wiping the grout some more.


Continue doing this until the glass is clean. It is VERY important that you keep the sponge flat so as not to pull the grout from between the spaces.

,, Using these, you can buff the vase so it shines. Done!

Assemble your materials in a comfortable, well-lit work area;
,
Break your pottery with hammer and/or nippers.,
Use a new terra cotta pot.,
Use a good non-oil based primer to seal the terra cotta both inside and out.,
Mix a small portion of polymer modified thinset mortar (not the speed setting kind as this will set too quickly).,
Using a plastic knife or palette knife, spread the mortar over a small area of your pot.,
Place your crockery shards in a pleasing pattern.,
Apply grout to cracks between crockery shards after the mortar has cured completely.,
Use a dry rag (lint free) or very slightly damp tile sponge (not a kitchen sponge) to gently clean off the grout from the tiles without pulling it out of the cracks.

,
Apply grout sealant after the grout has dried if you are concerned about staining.,
Display proudly.

",How to Create a Pique Assiette Mosaic,", Nippers will provide a much safer and cleaner cut for your tile. If using a hammer, always wear safety glasses and use a towel or other cloth to cover the plate or tile while breaking it.

, Never use an older, dirty one even if you have cleaned it, since there will continue to be both dirt residue and moisture in the terra cotta which will affect the curing of the adhesive.

, This will keep moisture from being drawn out of the adhesive during the curing process.

, Mortar is the most reliable adhesive to use for outdoor areas or areas that are in contact with moisture. Mastic is not a good adhesive for this purpose as it does not adhere well over the long term. Never use any ""pre-mixed"" thin set product. It has a curing retardant in it in order to keep it from curing on the shelf and this means your mosaic will not cure properly in a decent amount of time.

, Only work in areas you can finish at one time. Alternately you can place a small amount of mortar on the back of each piece as you set it. Make sure you are using enough mortar to hold the piece down but not so much that it squishes up into the spaces between the tiles where the grout will go.

, You may draw the pattern onto the pot ahead of time with a pencil and follow the lines.

, This usually is after 72 hours.

,, Otherwise, sealant is unnecessary.

Determine the size and shape of your desired garden border.,
Decide if you want one or multiple designed plates.,
Consider whether you want to repurpose old or already broken plates or if you want to use a new set.,
Decide on the best plate size.",How to Create a Garden Border with Broken Plate Pieces1," Maybe you'd like random shapes created from rugged, odd shaped broken plates. Or perhaps you'd prefer cleanly broken halves that all match in size and shape. Make this decision before cutting/breaking the plates or salvaging broken pieces.;
, You can choose between an eclectic mixture of any broken plate design you can lay your hands on. Or, you can be more precise and select plates only with the same pattern, to give a more uniform and formal appearance to the border. Again, decide before selecting plates and broken pieces.

, If you’ve broken one or two plates of your set in the past and can no longer use that set, you could break the remaining plates to use as your border. Or, if you don’t possess the pattern or color you desire, go to a garage sale or thrift store for plates in order to score the best deal possible.


This is a great opportunity to get rid of chipped or cracked plates that you no longer want to use.

, Which size best suits your needs? Teacup saucers, side plates or dinner plates? For extra large borders, think serving or carving plates. Match plate size to the area of border needing to be covered.

"
"
Choose the plate's border shape.,
Determine the length of the border.",How to Create a Garden Border with Broken Plate Pieces2," The neatest border will consist of a simple half moon shape (semi circle). If you want a different shape than this, it will take more work and if there are jagged pieces involved, there is a risk of injury to garden users, people and pets alike.


If using rugged, already broken pieces, aim to place sharp points down into the soil, leaving only soft, non-sharp edges facing upward.

, You’ll need to know how much land you’ll be covering with the border to know how many plates to prepare for the border. Usually you'll get at least two pieces of the border from one plate if using the simple half moon shape.

"
"
Use an appropriate tool to make precision cuts.,
Carefully break or cut each plate into the border shape.",How to Create a Garden Border with Broken Plate Pieces3," The tool must be able to cut through porcelain without spidering or smashing the plate. Recommended tools include a band saw, a wet tile saw, a hammer with nippers, a tile cutter or wheeled nippers.


If you don't want to do the cutting yourself, contact your local hardware or craft store to inquire about professional cutting. They may let bring your plate set in for cutting if you don’t have the right tool.

, In this case, the simple half moon shape is used. Place the finished cut plates that will be used as a border in a separate area while cutting the remainder of the plates.


Make sure the plates cannot be disturbed by children or pets (they could break again if moved or dropped).

"
"
Lay the plates out around the circumference of the are to be bordered.,
Tip the first plate upward and carefully push it into the dirt.,
If necessary, obtain a small shovel to dig a shallow trench before embedding plate.

,
Continue propping up the border plates and embedding them into the soil.,
Finished.

",How to Create a Garden Border with Broken Plate Pieces4," You’ll want to see how the prepared plates look once laid out around the garden before you embed them into the soil.

, Push it deeply enough so that the plate can stand up by itself and feels sturdy but not so deeply as to disappear and show very little of the pattern.

,, Continue until you've gone around the perimeter of the garden are you've mapped out for the border.,"

, Cut a long piece of wire that is twice the length of your Styrofoam ball, plus a few extra inches. Fold the wire in half.

, Keep threading the wire until the bent part sticks out from the bottom of the ball by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). This will eventually make the top of your disco ball.

, Widen the bent part of the wire slightly. Push a pencil through the loop. Grip the wire below the pencil with a pair of needle nose pliers. Twist the pencil a few times until the wire twists. Remove the pencil.You can use a pen or paintbrush instead of a pencil.

, Flip the ball over. Gently tug on the wire until the loop is flush against the top of the Styrofoam ball. Trim the excess wire at the bottom of the ball down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) with a pair of wire cutters., Push one wire to the left, and the other wire to the right. This will secure the ball to the wire, and keep it from falling off.For more security, fill the hole with hot glue.

, You can paint the ball using spray paint or acrylic paint. Silver would be a great choice, because it will help conceal any gaps. For extra sparkle, add some glitter spray paint on top.Use caution with spray paint. Some brands may dissolve some types of Styrofoam.

, Scratched or cracked CDs are perfectly fine for this project. Real CDs seem to work better than blank ones. You can buy a bunch from a thrift shop..

, Fill a pot with water and set it on the stove. Turn the heat up to high, and let the water come to a boil. You will be dipping the CDs into this water to make them easier to cut., Hold the CD in the water for a few seconds. Do not let it touch the bottom of the pot. Pull it out before it starts to warp. Work one CD at a time.If you have a lot of CDs to work with, boil only a few to start with. If you boil too many at once, they will harden and cool before you finish cutting them.

, Aim to make the strips about ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide. The strips that are towards the center top/bottom of the CD will be attached to the plastic ring in the center. Do not cut through this ring. Simply snap the strips off of the ring.


Kitchen shears are best, as the CD material could ruin a good pair of thinner scissors.
Some of the strips may crack. This is normal and happens sometimes.
Wear gloves during this step. The CDs may still be hot.

, Working on strip as a time, cut it into ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) squares. Discard the squares from the outer edges of the CD; they will have curved edges.

, If you have a small ball, set it upside down into a cup. If you have a large ball, use a bowl instead. This will keep the ball steady as you work.

, Place a drop of hot glue onto the back of a tile. Quickly press the tile against the bottom of the ball. Hot glue a few more tiles around it. Make sure that all of the tiles are touching.


You are starting from the bottom because that is the most visible part.

, Try not to leave any gaps between the tiles; they should all be touching on all four sides. This will give you a more finished, professional-looking disco ball. Work one tile at a time and don't apply the hot glue directly to the ball. If you do, it will harden and set before you get to it.

, At one point, you will have covered all of the Styrofoam that is visible. Carefully flip the ball over and set it back into its bowl or cup. Continue gluing the tiles in rows around the ball until you reach the top.


Don't worry if the tiles don't end up looking perfectly even as they reach the wire loop. This won't be visible once you hang the ball.

, Hot glue tends to leave behind little hairs or threads, which can make your disco ball look messy. Go over your ball, and pull off any little hairs that you can find. Alternatively, you can blast it with a hair dryer., Cut a long piece of string; fishing line would work best. Bring the ends together, and tie them into a sturdy knot.

, Push the string, knotted side first, through the wire loop by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Pull the rest of the string through the loop made by the string. Gently tug on the rest of the string to tighten the slip knot.

, Insert a hook into the ceiling. Slip the string over the hook.

, Turn off the lights, and aim a flashlight, spotlight, or strobe light at the ball. Give the ball a spin and watch how the reflected lights dance on the walls.

Wear proper protection when cutting stone using any type of tool.,
Determine which is harder by attempting to produce stone dust with repeated passes of the steel across the same precise line on the stone's surface.,
If the stone is thin, and the stone soft, use a change of blades and simply saw through it.,
Find a slim, hard steel edge and seat it inside the groove.,
Place a single layer of absorbent material, cotton cloth, heavy paper towel, etc, over the groove.

,
Wet it and hammer the steel edge in again.,
Periodically open the freezer and pour a small amount of cold water on the groove, insuring it is filled.

,
Once it is well filled with ice, leave it in the freezer overnight to insure the stone is deeply chilled throughout.,
Remove from the freezer and repeat the hammering along the steel edge inserted in the groove.,
The stone will break.

",How to Cut Hard Stone with Plain Steel Tools," Cover exposed skin, wear gloves, eye protection, and a respirator with 2 to 4 micron mesh if liquid is not used to control particulate dust. Many ores and certain crystals can cause acute and severe poisoning if not handled correctly in cutting! Arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury are toxic, and come in many natural forms. Be aware of the type and nature of the stone, especially if you will be exposed to it over long periods of time.;
, Synthetic diamond cutting tools have become relatively cheap, but begin with a hacksaw with a hardened steel blade.


The teeth of a hacksaw blade are designed to cut on the push, so remember that if you drag them against the surface on the pull backwards, you are dulling the blade MUCH faster!
Begin slowly and keep precise control, attempting to produce a straight groove that will guide further cutting.
If the hacksaw blade is reducing stone to dust slowly with each pass, continue cutting as long as the blade has an effective edge, periodically sweeping or blowing out stone dust.
With power tools, a mineral oil bath on the blade is required, but in this case it's unnecessary.

, If that is too slow, cut a good deep groove, hoping for 1/3 of the stone thickness in depth, but you may succeed with a groove as deep as 1/4 of the stone's thickness. You have some choices in how to go about fracturing it along that groove.


Ancient cultures would hammer dry pine wedges into the crevice, keep them soaked while allowing them to warm in the sun and slowly expand, which was often enough to split very impressive stone blocks, of considerable size and precision.
You could continue sawing around the stone and attempt to make the groove line up, but that is very hard to do.
Continue with steel and bring in stone's natural enemy, the destroyer of mountains, the shaper of valleys, quite possibly the most destructive substance on the planet, WATER.

, Use many repeated blows from a hammer, spread back and forth evenly along your steel edge, to produce a planar, linear, complex of impact fractures travelling through the stone, parallel to the direction of your blows. Eventually the network of microscopic fractures intersect in great numbers and produce a plane of weakness that can be exploited. Strike the stone a controlled and solid blow, to an outside edge, away from one side of the groove, it may simply fall in half. Continue with the scenario where it does not.

,, It should be snug, solid. If not, double the absorbent material over, and repeat with a double thickness. Soak well with clean water. Place in a bowl or on a deep tray, groove side up. Place in a freezer.

,, It may split on its own at any point, from the relentless expansion of ice in the groove. If it does not:

, Make solid, controlled direct hits that send the impact along the plane of microfractures. It is now penetrated by a network of ice crystals which have expanded and further fractured the plane of weakness you first impacts created. Strike it again at the outside edge, firmly and with controlled force in the direction that parallels the plane of weakness you have worked to create.

Estimate how much grout you will need for the project.,
Set up an area to begin working on your grout.,
Mix the grout for the mosaic project.,
Colour your grout for mosaic projects.,
Apply the grout to your mosaic project.,
Clean the excess grout from your project.",How to Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects1," Based on the area of the mosaic (length x width), the thickness of the tiles, and the gaps between the tiles, calculate how much grout you need.Set your mosaic on a piece of plastic or an old shower curtain to catch any wet grout that may fall as you’re spreading it, a trick that will be useful if you would like to reuse any dropped grout as you apply it to the project.Well-spaced tiles, with gaps under a quarter of an inch, then the entire mosaic (estimated to be 18”x 18”) can be covered with 2 pounds of grout.
For gaps between mosaic tiles that are greater than an eighth of an inch, you might have to consider grouting it with a grout that contains sand. Sand helps to reinforce the grout and assist it in being resistant to cracking.;
, The area you choose to work in should ideally be outdoors to minimize the cleanup of wet grout and dust contamination. The mosaic project needs to be dried completely before you begin grouting. Gather a bucket of water, a mixing tray, a mixing stick, rubber gloves, a sponge, paper towel or old rags, and a dust mask.Use latex gloves for mosaic made up of smooth tiles.
For tiles with sharper edges, wear rubber gloves which are less prone to tearing than latex gloves as you spread your grout around.

, After estimating how much grout you need for the project, pour the grout into the mixing tray. Mix 2 pounds to begin with, and if the project needs more, you can always mix more later on as you continue to grout. The grout container should tell you how much water you need.If you are colouring your grout by dyeing it, there are mineral concrete dyes sold in building material stores in a limited range of colors, such as black, brown, gray, terracotta, etc.
Alternatives to adding dye to your grout as you mix it include utilizing food coloring and acrylic paint. Add the dyes to your grout as you mix it.

, Squeeze a small amount of acrylic paint into your bucket of grout. Mix the grout some more, until you’ve noticed the paint is absorbed evenly within the grout.Continue to add paint in equal amounts until the grout appears slightly darker than the shade you desire your grout to be. As the mixture dries, your grout colour will appear lighter.
An alternate method of colouring grout would is using store-bought colour mix (dried grout colouring). Use two containers of colour mix (of the same colour) and add it to your grout.Mix the grout for two minutes, allow it to set for 10 minutes, and then mix it again for an additional minute.

, While wearing your protective gloves, take a large handful from the grout mixture and smear it onto the mosaic project. Cover the piece in different sections until all of the areas have been covered by the grout.Inspect the mosaic and make sure that the cracks between the mosaic tiles are completely filled by grout.
Run your fingers along the cracks to push grout down and secure it in the spaces even further. As you inspect, there shouldn’t be any bubbles between the grout and wood.

, After smearing grout onto the mosaic piece, there will be a sheet of grout covering the entire surface of the mosaic. Wipe away excess grout with rags or a paper towel for smaller projects and a grout sponge for projects 1 square foot in area or larger.A thin grout of haze will be left over even after the excess grout has been cleaned off. Allow it to dry for a few minutes to make the thin layer easier to see and to clean.
Give the mosaic project one last wipe using a clean paper towel or a dry rag. The last layer of excess grout should be lifted at this point.
Wrap a rag or a paper towel around your finger and remove any grout that appears built up on any tiles on the surface area of the mosaic piece. Finished grout needs to be flush against the tiles themselves or slightly lower than the height of the tiles around it.

"
"
Clean the grout from your mosaic tiles.,
Pour your colorant into a squirt-tip bottle.,
Apply a second coat after applying the first coat.",How to Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects2," Before you can begin dyeing your grout, you must pre-scrub the space in between tiles to ensure that the colour you apply will adhere to the grout itself and not any dirt that’s left there. This promotes staying power for colorants.Use a degreaser to clean your grout. Spray the degreaser along the grout lines. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes and then start scrubbing it with a toothbrush. Wipe the gunk removed between tiles up with a paper towel.
Repeat as needed until the grout is as clean as you need it to be. When it’s done being cleaned, allow the grout to sit overnight in order to dry completely.

, Although it’s safe to apply colorant using the bottle it is sold in, using a bottle with a squirt-tip allows for an easier application. Squeeze the colorant with the bottle’s applicator tip positioned directly into the grout lines.Make a thin line in the middle of the tile lines and work in smaller areas of 6” at a time. Small areas are ideal because of how fast colorants tend to dry and applying the colorant a little at a time will ensure that you are able to distribute the colorant evenly before it dries.
Use a cotton swab to work the colorant into the tile lines evenly. If any excess gets on the tile itself, clean it up quickly with a paper towel.

, Adding grout to the entire surface area will be a long job so be prepared to take a while completing it. After the first layer has been applied, applying a second layer might be necessary (especially when transitioning darker grout to a lighter grout). Allow two hours for each coat of grout to dry."

Determine the right colour grout you’d like to use.,
Opt for a grout colour that blends with the mosaic tile.,
Select a grout colour that contrasts the mosaic tile colours.,
Pick a grout colour that acts as an accent to the tile.",How to Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects3," Keep in mind that although colour can be provided by grout, it is best to allow the tile to provide the colour in mosaic designs. Most designers advise you to use grout that acts like a thin gray line in order to make tiles appear distinct without venturing on too boldly.


White grout can appear very harsh as it will draw the eye to the gaps rather than the coloured tiles. However, it can be a complement to lighter tones so it is very good for showing off pale mosaics. And when used with strong bright colours, it will produce a Mediterranean feel.
Grey grout enhances most coloured tesserae and has the most unifying effect of all the coloured grouts.
Dark grout unifies darker coloured tesserae and segregates lighter ones.

, It’s impossible to match a grout colour to the exact colour of a tile due to the variations of shading most tiles possess. Opt for a grout colour that is in the same colour family or blends with the tile. This is a common selection for people who wish for the focus to be on the entire floor versus the individual tile.

, Choosing a grout colour that contrasts your tile focuses your eye to see the tile as an individual instead of an entire picture, as you would with blending grout colours. This is great for people who want a black and white pattern or checkerboard effect on their floors.


For example, gray grout should not be used with a gray tile. Use a red-brown terra cotta grout for gray tile instead.Avoid matching colours and gravitate towards contrasting colours.

, Accent colours are used by people who want to compliment an accent colour they might be using in their overall design scheme. If you go with this option, understand that if you ever are to change your design theme later down on the road, you might have to change the grout colour you used initially as well.

"

Decide between cement or epoxy based grout.,
Add sand to your grout.,
Include a sealing grout.,
Choose between light shades and dark shades.",How to Colour Grout for Mosaic Projects4," Cement-based grout is the most commonly used form of grout, and is also the most cost-effective of grouts available for use. Epoxy is more expensive, more difficult to install, and harder to find, so it might not be worth the effort when making your decision. But to counter its cons, it has pros of being more durable and having greater resistance to chemical and water damage., Adding sand isn’t a crucial component to grout picks, but it is advised for tiles that have spaces in between them greater than 1/8 inch. It makes grout more resistant to shrinking and cracking which is a must for bigger tile space areas., For lighter coloured grout on floors, pick a grout colourant that includes a sealant. Sealing grout combats the high traffic and moisture kitchen and bathroom areas might receive and protect the grout for much longer. Stay away from “membrane-forming” sealers and invest in breathable “penetrating” sealers instead., Darker grouts can hide stains and dirt more easily than lighter shades, but are more likely to show staining and fading from harsh cleansers. Lighter grouts tend to show more dirt. Lean towards shades that are not super light but are not super dark either."

Cut wood to desired size using the saw.,
Look at both sides of the wood and pick the side that is smoother or has the nicer grain to be carved.,
Paint the India ink on the side you are going to carve and then let the block dry.

,
Transfer your design.",How to Do Western Woodblock Printing1," The block should be smaller then the paper you are using by an inch on all sides. Save scarp piece to practice carving on.;
, If there are any small imperfections use the sandpaper to smooth them out.

,, Rub the back of the paper with the design on it with chalk. Then lay the paper chalk side down on the block. Then trace the design. Your design will be reversed on the final print so if you do any writing you need to trace and carve the letter backwards so the appear correctly in the print.

"
"
Before carving your block you should practices carving on a scrap piece of wood.The V gouge is used to make lines.,
Hold the gouge in one hand.,
Keep the base of your second hand on the wood and your finger on top of the hand with the gouge.,
Lightly push the gouge into the wood at an angle.,
Apply a forward force, as you reduce the angle.,
When you get to the end of the line pull the gouge back out and push the edge of the gouge straight into the end point so the wood breaks clean.,
When carving out large selections use the V gouge to outline the selection then go back with the U gouge to carve the selection out.

,
If you make a mistake, use the wood glue to glue big pieces back in or use wood putty to patch small bits.

",How to Do Western Woodblock Printing2," The more presser you apply the V gouge the wider and deeper the line you will make.The U gouge is used for removing large selections of the wood.

, Your palm should be around the round part of the handle with your finger under it and your thumb out over the blade.

, This will give you more control over the gouge.

,  Be sure you don't have your hand in front of the gouge in case the gouge slips.

, This should carve out a straight line.

, You will find the carving with the grain is easier the carving against it.

,
Examine your proof.",How to Do Western Woodblock Printing3," A proof is quick print to check your block. Make sure you workspace is clean before you start

, You should use about ¼ retarder to ¾ ink, but this varies from brand to brand. The amount of ink needed will vary depending on the size of your block.

,,,, The harder you rub the more ink will transfer and the dark that part will look. This is great way to get contrast in you print.

, If the paper stick to block, your ink is drying to fast and you should add more ink retarded.

,, This is your chance to change anything you don’t like about your print. Check to make sure all your lines came out. If your lines didn’t come out, you will need to re-carve them. If you are unsure of your new re-carved lines do another proof.

"
"
Once you are happy with the way your proof comes out you can do a real print.",How to Do Western Woodblock Printing4," Repeat the same steps for doing a proof but this time use the printing paper. Make sure when you lay the paper down the smooth side is down and there is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) margin around the block.

Cut your ribbon into 7-8"" (18-20 cm) pieces.,
Tie knots of ribbon around the wreath form.,
Adjust the ribbons and squeeze in more.,
Add any finishing touches, if desired.",How to Make a Ribbon Wreath1," For a 12"" wreath, you'll need about 60 yards (54.9 m) of ribbon total. Basically, cut loads and loads of ribbon. Most ribbon fabrics will work, but the stiffer the better. At such a short length, most will stay erect and fluffy. As for widths, you'll find it's easiest to work with ribbons around 1"" (2.5 cm) wide or less.









Experiment with a bunch of different colors. Think about using a zinger fabric -- a handful of more muted colors and one color that really pops.
Cut the ends at an angle. This is not only pretty, but keeps them from fraying as easily.;
, Take one color and tie a handful of pieces at different points around the wreath. After a dozen or so are tied, switch colors. This guarantees an even gradient to your wreath.









Tie 'em tight! You don't want them coming undone. And make sure you cover all parts of the frame -- there might be some small pieces that aren't in the main circle, but provide structure.

, Once you think you're getting done, scrunch the ribbons together. New spaces should form for you to tie in more. There should be some overlap -- this will make your wreath voluminous and full.








, Though your wreath is beautiful now (and ready to hang!) you may add a few touches if you'd like. Does it feel like it's missing anything?









A thin sheen of spray glitter can add a nice touch to ribbon that's otherwise solid-colored and uniform.
A giant bow on top may make your wreath seem more wreath-like and less like, well, a circle.

Prepare the plastic ribbons.,
Form the hanger.,
Work it into a circle shape.,
Start tying on your ribbon.,
Continue to attach the ribbons to the wire until the circle is completely covered.,
Twist, turn and fluff the plastic ribbon to create fullness.,
At the neck of the hook, tie a brightly colored or glittery ribbon into a bow.,
Hang the completed wreath by the exposed hook at the top.",How to Make a Ribbon Wreath2," Cut a bunch of plastic bags into strips of about 2 inches (5cm) wide by 5 to 6 inches (5-7.5cm) long. Any longer and your wreath will lose its body and oomph.









How many ribbon pieces you need depends on the size of the wreath you're going for. Somewhere in the realm of 400 should do the trick if you're working with a standard-sized wire hanger.
For ribbons, colored plastic bags work well, but so do strips of cut or torn fabric (such as cotton, flannel, worn denim, old neckties, etc.). Avoid t-shirt fabric, soft knits, satin or silk, as these materials are too loose and slinky to hold up under their own weight.

, While holding the hanger by the hook in one hand, grasp the hanger in the center of the bottom hanger bar with your other hand. Gently stretch the hanger until the hanger forms a crude squarish-diamond shape.









You could also make a crude heart shape if you're making the wreath for an event such as Valentine's Day or Mother's Day. It won't be perfect, but the ribbon will disguise any imperfections.

, With both hands near each other, as if you were trying to break a pencil in half, bend the wire all the way around the diamond until the wire forms a rough circle. The circle does not need to be perfect, as it's going to be covered in ribbon soon.









Don't worry about it being a perfect circle, but do try to get it so that it lays relatively flat on a surface. If one side juts up more than another, it'll look wonky when hung.

, Randomly select one to three strips of the plastic ""ribbon"" and tie onto the wire form. You can go in a specific order or you can go as haphazardly as you like. At the end, you may not be able to tell if there was a pattern at all.









If you're not sure if you have enough of a specific color or colors, tie around the wreath at different points (3, 6, 9, and 12 o'clock for example). That way the color will stay evenly spread even if you do run out.

, As you near the finish line, push the ribbons closely together at the knot, towards the hanger hook. Add more if space presents itself while adjusting









If desired, consider mixing a few strips of colorful ribbon in with the plastic ribbons (grosgrain ribbon, fabric hem tape, fabric bias tape, or simply cut strips of fabric).

, The plastic strips are very malleable and can be molded easily. And if one isn't cooperating, simply take it off!









If you'd like to decorate it, do so at this step. Glue small buttons, paper cut-out shapes, candy hearts or pinwheel mints to the tails of the focal ribbon for accent.

, This takes your project from a pretty, fluffy hoop to an actual wreath decoration. Alternately, you could tie the ribbon at the bottom, but using the hook is much, much easier.








, And you thought using a hanger was being cheap. No, it's being resourceful! Could it be any easier?

Use soapy water.,
Use wipes.",How to Clean Rubber Stamps1," Be aware that washing this way can loosen the adhesive of the rubber portion from a wooden block stamp. If that is a concern, use the wipes method instead; alternatively, only wipe, do not dip (and definitely do not soak) the rubber stamps.


Fill a bowl with warm, soap water. Use a mild soap.
Dip the stamp into the bowl to dampen the rubber portion. Alternatively, dip the cleaning implement in the soapy water, to spare the stamp holding portion from getting wet.
Use a cleaning cloth to wipe the ink off or scrub with an old toothbrush.
Repeat until the ink has come off.;
, Simply wipe the ink off using any suitable wipe, such as a baby wipe, a cleaning wipe or a travel wipe. The wipes are safest when they do not contain alcohol or aloe. To dry, press into a thick layer of paper towel.

Press the paper or fabric over the block.,
Let the print dry properly.,
Clean your print block and tools thoroughly.",How to Block Print1," It takes a great deal of care and a set of specialized tools to carve print blocks from wood or linoleum. Most craft and artist supply stores will sell starter kits specially suited to one block printing technique or another. Both wood and linoleum print blocks can hold enough surface detail to use quality printers’ ink, but they will work with paint as well.


Traditional block printing uses carved wooden blocks or “woodcuts.” Wooden blocks make beautiful and durable printing blocks for use with the highest quality printmaking inks. However, because these blocks are carved directly out of the wood, they can require expensive tools and a knowledge of woodworking.
A “linocut” is a printing block made of carved linoleum, typically a layer of linoleum fixed to a block of wood. Linoleum print blocks are durable and hold a great amount of surface detail, and they can be much softer than wood, which makes them easier to carve for beginners.However, producing a linocut also requires a set of specialized tools.;
, Keep in mind that you will be carving into the printing block to make a relief image, which means the lines you draw become the negative space of the finished design. Also, because a printing block works like a stamp, you want to draw the design backwards, a mirror-image of the final print.


Some image editing software can ""invert"" your design, switching the black to white and vice versa. This can help you visualize the final design better.
The same software can also “flip” or “mirror” images for you. If you have trouble drawing letters or images backwards, this software can help tremendously.
If you feel comfortable using acetone to transfer your design onto the block, you can draw your design on a piece of paper in ink without “flipping” it backwards.The acetone will bleed the ink from the top side of the paper onto the wood or linoleum in reverse, resulting in the correct orientation when it comes time for printmaking.

, Tape a piece of transfer paper directly onto the block with the shaded side of the page against the surface of the block. Then tape or clamp your design over the lighter side of the transfer paper. Using a pen or stylus, trace your design entirely.


The ink on the back of the transfer paper will leave a “carbon copy” of your design on the surface of the block.
If you are using acetone, place your inked design face-down on the linoleum or wooden block itself and brush over the paper lightly with acetone. The ink will bleed off the page and leave a reversed impression on the surface of your block.Presto!

, This is easier said than done, and an elaborate carving can take many hours, even days or weeks.


Linoleum and wood carving tools look similar to the tools used for sculpting clay but will have much sharper edges. Never pull blades or sharp tools towards your fingers or body!
Remember that you are carving the image in relief. The surface of the block will carry the ink, which means any cuts or lines you make will show up as negative space on the paper or fabric.

, Make initial prints on practice paper to fix details and find any imperfections in the carving. It will take patience to carve a block that produces a finished print just like your original design.


Keep in mind that you can always carve more out of your block, but it is just about impossible to put material back on! Move slowly.

, Whether you are using a new block or an old favorite, remove all dust, debris, and dried ink or paint from the surface of your printing block before each use. Unwanted particles will show up on the print and mar the design.

, Printers’ ink is sticky and much thicker than the more common ink used in fountain pens. It also dries very quickly. Using a brayer (ink roller), mix the ink on a glass plate according to any listed instructions to get the consistency right for printmaking.


It might take additive thinners or other chemicals to keep the ink from drying too quickly.
If you are printing onto fabric, oil-based ink is recommended. Oil-based inks can take up to four days to dry and must be cleaned with mineral spirits to keep your wood or linoleum block usable.
Oil-based inks will stain clothes and surfaces so prep your work area carefully.

, After getting the ink to the right consistency, use the brayer to spread the ink evenly over your carved printing block. The ink will be tacky enough to avoid running into the lines and recesses etched into the block.


Practice on test paper to perfect how much ink you need to use for each print.
Professional printmakers will often make separate blocks for each color to be used in a professional design.
If you are using paint, you will be tempted to simply brush the surface of the block with paint, but be careful to maintain any surface details essential to the design.

, Use a baren (printmakers’ rubbing tool) or a similar utensil, such as a wooden spoon, to press slowly and evenly over the back of the paper. Ensure good contact between the carved surface of the block and your medium. Peel the material off the block carefully to avoid smudging.


Reapply ink between each printing to ensure the best quality products.
Depending on the size of your materials, you may want to clamp the block in place before making prints. Professional printmakers have sophisticated presses that hold the print medium in place against the block.
Do not let the paper or fabric move at all! Any side-to-side motion will smear the ink across the surface.
Smaller blocks can be “stamped” directly onto paper or fabric. Press straight down and pull straight up.

, Different combinations of pigment and printing media will dry differently, and printmakers’ ink can take several days to dry.Hanging prints to dry keeps them out of the way and safe during the long drying process.

, Keeping your tools and printing blocks clean is the best way to ensure they last a long time and continue to function properly.


Water-soluble inks can be washed with soap and water.
If you are using acrylic paint, wash wooden blocks immediately to stop the plastic from warping the wood as it dries.
Use mineral spirits to clean linoleum and wood blocks used with oil-based inks.

Dried ink that is flat and clean on the stamp is a color stain, not a dirty stamp. It is only if the ink has built up and interferes with your stamping that it's a real problem.

,, Hold the stamp by the handle. Run the rubber image under the water until the water runs clear. It's okay to see black, red, or another color of ink while rinsing the stamp.

Choose which material to use.,
Draw your design directly onto the sponge or block of foam.,
Cut out your design carefully.,
Prepare your paint for printmaking.,
Stamp your painted block on the paper.",How to Block Print2," Sponges and foam can make excellent print blocks for crafts at home.They work well with water-based as well as acrylic hobby paints to “stamp” simple prints on paper and fabric, but they hold much less surface detail than wood and linoleum.


Different kinds of foam you find around your house, such as Styrofoam, can work to make simple outline stamps. However, the denser, specially made “foamcore” available at craft stores will hold noticeably more surface detail and last much longer.

, Because these materials will be used mainly as stamps, the outline of the shape is the most important part of the design.


If you are using a flat foam block, such as a Styrofoam plate, you can draw a design on paper and trace it heavily with a stylus to “transfer” the image onto the foam., Using a pair of scissors or a craft knife, cut the shape out of the sponge or block of foam. The resulting shape will be your printing stamp.


Always cut away from your body and fingers!
Foam plates can be etched with images and printed on paper easily without making a “block” or “stamp” at all., Mix up the color and consistency of the paint you want to use on a palette or mixing slate. Make sure there is enough room in the container to fit your stamp.

, After wiping off any excess paint from the stamp, simply press the block down on your medium. Depending on how absorbent the material is, you may be able to get a few printings from each application of paint.

"
Choose your design.,
Create your design.,
Print a graphic or template from the Internet.,
Use a stamp as an outline.",How to Build Stencils1," Since you're making your own stencil, there's no limitations on what you can create. Think about the size of the surface you plan to stencil (T-shirt, wall, bookmark), who the design is for (baby, birthday girl, best friend) and where the stenciled image will be (bathroom wall, kitchen border, skateboard deck.


Stay with the basics. Letters, numbers and basic shapes (circles, squares and diamonds) can be an easy but effective design choice. Combine a couple of these elements for a personalized look.
Work with a theme. Consider motifs associated with different themes--shells, starfish, sea horses, boats and anchors create a nautical look. Rams, bulls, scales, fish and crabs are all elements inspired by a zodiac theme.
Draw inspiration from nature. Flowers, trees, butterflies, leaves and sun are just some examples of ideas you can come up with by simply looking outside your window.
Stick to the classics. Chose a Greek key, a fleur de lis, a Celtic cross or other traditional and universally recognizable symbols.
If you're new to stenciling, you might want to start with an image that's fairly basic in design--not too many separate pieces or too much detail. If you're more experienced or simply confident in your skills, you can create something that's more intricate.;
, Once inspiration has struck and you've decided on a design, it's time to capture it as the next step to creating your stencil.


Draw the design by hand. You can put pencil to paper to get your idea down. Drawing it yourself allows for maximum creativity and room to play and adjust your design.

Work in pencil until you get the design to your liking. Later you'll trace over it with a permanent marker so that it's easy to see the outline when you cut.



, There are tons of online sites that offer free stencils for you to download and print to your home computer.


In some cases, you may need to take your printed image to a copier to reduce or enlarge it. In other cases, you may have the option to change the size when you print or you can change your printer settings to allow it print the image larger or smaller.

, If there's a rubber stamp design you like, consider using it as the outline for your stencil. Press the stamp into a pad of black ink and then press it firmly onto a sheet of white paper. Make sure the lines are clean and clear. Use a copier to increase or decrease the size of your stamped image to fit the size you need for your stencil.


If the rubber stamp image is too detailed, it may not be a good choice for a stencil. If you still like it, consider eliminating some of the detail lines--paint over them with Whiteout--to simplify the image.

Single-Overlay Stencil.,
Trace your image onto thin tracing paper.,
Multiple-Overlay Stencil.",How to Build Stencils2," A single-overlay stencil is a single sheet of paper or plastic on which you draw and cut your completed design.


Make a single-overlay stencil if you're working from a black-and-white image or if you want your final image to be a silhouette or ghost of the image.
If you want to work with a colored image, choose one that has high contrast and very little variation in color.
The downside to single layers are that some detail may be lost like, but the upside is that you'll only have one sheet to cut and paint.

, Outline the image and separate its different parts. Areas should have clear boundaries that allow ""bridges"" to appear around the openings where paint is to be applied.


Make sure the bridges are wide enough to keep paint from seeping under and smudging your image.

, For a design with more detail or more color variations, you'll need to create a multiple-overlay stencil. In other words, you'll create several stencils--each with a portion of the image on it--and layer them one-by-one on your stenciling surface to apply the paint/ink and create the finished design.


Trace your image onto thin tracing paper. Begin as you would for a single-overlay stencil. Outline the image and separate its different parts. Areas should have clear boundaries that allow ""bridges"" to appear around the openings where paint is to be applied.






Make sure the bridges are wide enough to keep paint from seeping under and smudging your image.


Create registration marks. Draw a small triangle or other simple shape in each of the four corners of your drawing. You will copy these onto each overlay you create so that you can line up each layer exactly in place.






Lay a new piece of tracing paper over your first stencil drawing. Trace the openings and bridges that go together either by color or purpose (shadows, highlights, etc.)






Create as many overlays as you need until you've retraced all the elements of the design.







"
"
Choose your material.,
Reinforce your stencil.,
Draw or trace your stencil design.,
Cut out the stencil.",How to Build Stencils3," You don't have to buy expensive paper to create a stencil--you may already have what you need in your kitchen, home office or craft room.


Freezer paper. Freezer paper, also known as grease-proof paper, is available at your local grocery store; it's stocked right next to the tinfoil, plastic wrap and wax paper. Unlike wax paper, which was a waxy finish on both sides, freezer paper has a waxy finish on one side only.

Freezer paper is a good choice if you plan to stencil on fabric (T-shirt, onesie, tote bag). Draw your design on the unwaxed side. After the stencil is cut out, place it waxy-side down on your fabric. Use an iron to gently heat the paper, and it will stick to the fabric's surface, making it easy to then apply the paint.


Tracing paper. Start with tracing paper if you plan to trace the outline of your stencil from an existing design you've found in a book or downloaded from the internet. Tracing paper is thin enough that it's easy to see through it and accurately copy your design.
Letter stock. Computer paper and other medium-weight paper can be used to create a stencil. A big plus of this material is that you're likely to already have it on hand.
Heavy paper. Cardstock and cardboard make for a sturdier stencil that holds up well with multiple uses. Because this paper is so thick, it's a little more difficult to cut. Be sure your blade is very sharp when working with these papers so that your cuts are clean.
Carbon paper. If you've created your stencil on tracing paper but want to transfer it to a sturdier paper, you can use carbon paper to transfer the design.

Place the sturdy paper onto your table. Layer a sheet of carbon paper on top of it. Be sure the matte side of the carbon paper is facing up and the side with the carbon is facing down.
Lay your tracing paper design on top of the carbon paper. Retrace the design going over every line and detail. Apply firm pressure as you work to ensure that your design transfers clearly and completely.
Remove the tracing paper and the sheet of carbon paper. The design will now be ""printed"" on your sturdy paper.



, It's a good idea to make your stencil as strong as possible so that it stands up well for your project and allows you the option of reusing it in the future.

Cover the stencil in contact paper. Clear contact paper is readily available in the housewares department of your local hardware or discount store.






Place your stencil flat on a nonporous surface. You don't want to accidentally remove the finish from a table by having it come into contact with the sticky paper.
Cut a piece of contact paper the size of your stencil, remove the backing and stick it to the stencil. Trim away any excess.


Use packing tape. Place your stencil design-side down on a nonporous surface. Run strips of packing tape over the stencil. Overlap each strip with the next until the entire surface is covered. Run the tape past the edges of the paper and trim the excess







, If you're drawing, you may want to start by working in pencil. Once you have the design how you want it, retrace your pencil lines with a fine to medium point permanent marker. If you're tracing a design, you can use a marker to begin with.


If you've created multiple lines while making your initial pencil drawing, be clear on what the final outline should be before going over it in ink.

, Because of its delicate nature, cutting paper requires a sharp blade and significant patience. Trying to move too quickly can result in rips and tears that will mean redrawing your stencil and starting again.


Secure your stencil in place. Use masking tape to secure the edges of your paper stencil firmly in place on your cutting surface. You could also use small bits of poster gum to get the paper to stick to the work surfaced. To make sure you have contact between the paper and the surface, use only a small amount of the gum and thoroughly flatten it out.
Use a sharp, new blade in your cutting knife and remove the areas of your stencil where you plan to apply paint or ink.
Do not cut out your bridges--those borders that separate one section of your stencil image from the other.
If your stencil is particularly large or your using heavier paper, you may have to replace your blade mid-project; do so as soon as the blade seems dull to prevent it from dragging and tearing your paper.
When making long cuts, hold hold your knife at a lower angle and further away from your blade.
As you move around your stencil, turn the paper not your hand.
To create sharp edges, cut away from corners not into them.
Use tweezers and a sharp knife to remove the cut stencil pieces.
When you've finished, peel up the tape by its edges. If you can't remove it from the paper stencil without it ripping, simply fold it over onto the back. If you used poster gum, work from one corner and remove the gum from the back of your stencil.

If you notice that one of your cuts did not go all the way through, immediately put the plastic back on, re-secure it to the surface and go over the intact area with your blade.



"
"
Choose your plastic sheet.,
Draw or trace your stencil onto the plastic.,
Cut out the stencil.,
Smooth out the rough edges.",How to Build Stencils4," There are primarily two kinds of plastic to choose from when it comes to creating a stencil--acetate and Mylar. They both do the job well, it's simply a matter of preference, so check them out at your local craft store to see which appeals to you


These films come in clear and color, are available by the sheet or by the roll and some even have an adhesive backing.
Check the surface to be sure it accepts pen or pencil well so that you can easily draw or trace your design. Look for plastic that has a matte finish as this surface will typically work with graphic or ink.
Acetate does have a couple of disadvantages if you're making a stencil that you plan to keep. With time it develops a yellow or grayish cast and its edges have a tendency to curl.
Repurpose your old x-rays. Put those old plastic films to a new use as a material for your stencil design.

, Creating a clear drawing or sharply traced stencil is key to making sure you'll be able to easily follow the pattern when it comes time to cut your stencil.


Use a permanent marker with a sharp tip to draw or trace your design. If you initially created your design in pencil, trace over it now with the marker.
Be careful not to smudge the marker line as you work. The clearer the lines, the more easily you'll be able to follow them when you make your cuts.

, A sharp blade and a hard cutting surface are all you need to successfully cut out your stencil. Move slowly and firmly around your design. Stopping occasionally to relax and refocus can help you to keep a steady hand.


Secure your stencil in place. Lightly spray the back of the stencil with contact adhesive, wait until it's tacky and place it on your cutting surface. Alternately, you can tape the outside edges of the stencil down and firmly in place.
Use a sharp, new blade in your cutting knife and remove the areas of your stencil where you plan to apply paint or ink.
Do not cut out your bridges--those borders that separate one section of your stencil image from the other.
When making long cuts, hold hold your knife at a lower angle and further away from your blade.
As you move around your stencil, turn the plastic not your hand.
To create sharp edges, cut away from corners not into them.
Use tweezers and a sharp knife to remove the cut stencil pieces.
When you've finished, remove the tape and/or carefully peel the plastic stencil film up starting from the outer edges.

If you notice that one of your cuts did not go all the way through, immediately put the plastic back done, re-secure it to the surface and go over the intact area with your blade.



, Gently go over the newly cut surfaces of your stencil with fine sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges. If edges aren't smooth, your image won't be clean and crisp when you apply your paint.


After sanding, remove the plastic dust with a piece of cheesecloth or soft cotton rag.

,
Finished.








",How to Stencil Fabric," Make sure it does not have a stain resistant finish. If you can pre-wash your fabric, you will be sure that it is clean of any surface treatment that will keep the paint from adhering. Do not use fabric softener. For your first project, try to avoid any soft or floaty fabric that will be difficult to keep straight. The color of the fabric will affect the color of the paint so try to avoid dark colors, unless you want that ""velvet Elvis"" look!






;
,









To cut your own stencil from acetate, you will need a drawing or photocopy of a design, a sheet of glass and a small, sharp matte knife like an Exacto™ blade.
To make a stencil out of printer paper, simply print a simple silhouetted design from your computer and cut within the lines. This method is quick and cheap, although the stencil may not last through more than two or three uses.
To paint with a custom or purchased stencil, you will need textile paints, specifically designed to be both washable and dry cleanable. These paints will need to dry for 24 hours and be heat set. Nontoxic water-based textile paints are commonly available at crafts stores.
If you are adapting a design, make sure it will work as a stencil. Take time to plan how you will cut and try to plan only one overlay. If you have complex interlocking lines, you will need at least two stencil overlays, which will require careful pattern matching.

, Tape everything in place.








, You will probably find that it is easier to cut accurately if you pull the blade slowly towards you. Turn the glass as necessary. If you make a mistake, you can repair it with a small piece of masking tape.








, Do not thin the paint unless it is very, very thick - watery paint will bleed under your stencil edges. If you want pale colors, add white or use a very dry, transparent stenciling technique.








, Make sure your brush is evenly covered with paint but do not load it. A loaded brush will spread paint under the edges of the stencil. Your goal is a nice, even dry brush technique with color that is smooth but not thick.








, Apply the paint with a gentle pounding motion, holding the brush straight up and down. Do not use a stroking motion. Again, this will keep the paint from seeping under the edges of the stencil. If your design has delicate bits that seem to be lifting as you paint, use an awl or chopstick OR even masking tape/ sellotape to hold them down as you paint.









Make sure to complete all the painting before proceeding to lifting the stencil. Once it has been moved, it is almost impossible to replace it exactly in the same spot.


, The paint should be dry to the touch, but let it dry for 24 hours.

Create a chain for the top.",How to Make a Mobile1," Slide one paperclip to the exact center of the straw. Slide the other two paperclips onto opposing ends.









The paperclip in the center should be turned upward and the two at the ends should face down.
Place the paperclips at the ends roughly 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) away from their respective ends.;
, Follow the same procedure to make two other straw-and-paperclip units.









Each straw should have one paperclip in the center, facing up, and two paperclips on opposing ends, both facing down.

, Make the mobile look more interesting by creating chains of varying lengths.









You can use as many paperclips as desired to create chains that are as long or short as desired.
For an example, however, connect the second straw unit to the first by clipping the center paperclip of the second to the right paperclip of the first.
Off the left paperclip of the first straw unit, hang three additional paperclips. Attach the lowest of these paperclips to the middle paperclip of the final straw unit.

, Draw stars, hearts, geometric shapes, letters, numbers, or other simple shapes on colorful construction paper. Cut them out with scissors.









You should have about four to six shapes for this mobile. The first straw unit should not have any shapes hanging off of it directly, but each additional unit should be able to fit three shapes.

, Clip the paper directly to the paperclips hanging down from the ends of the straw unit.









You can also create chains of paper clips in order to create a less symmetrical mobile.
For instance, on the second unit, clip the left-most paperclip directly to the shape. Hang two paperclips from the center paperclip and attach another shape to the lowest one. Hang an additional three paperclips down from the right-most paperclip and attach your shape to the lowest.
On the third unit, attach the shapes directly to the paperclips on each end. Hang two paperclips down from the center before attaching your final shape.

, Since your paperclips and stars may be slightly uneven, you might need to slide a few of the paperclips over in order to keep the mobile balanced.









If the paperclips seem loose and move around even after you finish positioning them, hold the paperclips in place using a small square of tape or a dot of glue. Let the glue dry before continuing.

, Clip your remaining paperclips to the top paperclip on the first straw unit. Use as many as desired in order to achieve the length you want.

You could also use sturdy construction paper or cardstock.
If desired, you could print pictures from your computer and cut those out to use instead of drawing pictures by hand.

, You should have four lengths of string, one for each shape, and each piece of string should be slightly different in size from the others.









As an estimate, make one piece of string 1 foot (30 cm) long and each additional piece 2 inches (5 cm) longer or shorter.
You can use yarn, twine, fishing wire, ribbon, thread, or any other string for this step. Thicker options, like yarn and ribbon, might last longer, however.

, Center each piece of string on the top center of one shape. Staple in place.









Alternatively, you could punch holes into each shape using a metal hole puncher. If using this approach, tie the string through the holes instead of stapling it on.

, You should cut off a piece of wire that is roughly 1 foot (30 cm) long from each hanger.









Use a wire cutter. Do not use ordinary scissors.
Work carefully to avoid cutting yourself on the jagged wire edges.

, Use pliers to bend each cut end of wire down and over into the shape of a loop.









The loops should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in diameter.
Create a closed loop so that the sharp ends are no longer exposed. A closed loop will also prevent the string from slipping off after you attach it.

, Use your pliers to bend one of the two wires at the center. Twist the wire around to create a loop at the center of this wire.









This loop should be a little larger. Aim for a loop with a diameter around 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Slide the wire without a center loop through the center loop of the other wire.









If you have difficulty getting the end loops through the center loop, carefully unbend one loop enough to slide the wire through before bending it back in place.
Position the second wire so that its middle rests inside the loop of the first.

, Use your pliers to bend the second wire into a loop that locks around the center loop of your first wire.









Both loops should be at the center of their respective pieces of wire, and both should be roughly the same size.

, Tie each string to the loops on the end of the wires.









Readjust the lengths of the strings as desired until you achieve a final result that looks pleasing to you.

, Attach another string to the top center loop. Use this string to hang your mobile.

",How to Make a Mobile3," Each piece of ribbon should be long enough to tie into a bow.









The sizes can vary if you want to create bows that vary in size for an asymmetrical effect.
Range the ribbon sizes from 6 to 10 inches (15 1/4 to 25 1/2 cm).
Choose ribbons with different colors and textures to create something more visually interesting.

, Knot each ribbon into a standard ""rabbit ear"" bow.









Depending on the condition your ribbons are in, you may want to iron them flat before tying them in order to create a smoother bow.
Double knot the bow at the center to create a sturdier bow, if desired.
Trim the ends of the ribbon after you tie them into bows so that they look even.

, Vary the lengths of twine by 1 inch (2.5 cm).









Make the first piece of twine roughly 15 inches (38 cm). Every piece you cut after that should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) smaller.

, Thread each piece of twin through the backs of one bow, at the center loop. Tie a simple knot to keep the bow on the twine.









For extra security, consider double knotting the twine onto the bow.

, Tie the other end of each piece of twine to the wooden embroidery hoop.









Space each piece of twine around the hoop evenly. Note that it may be easier to arrange an even number of strands than an odd number.
Arrange the pieces of twine so that they ascend in height from longest the shortest. This creates a spiral-like appearance.

, Cut two pieces of twine that are about twice as long as the length of the hoop's diameter. Tie these pieces to the embroidery hoop, crossing them at the center.









Knot or double knot the twine onto the embroidery hoop to secure it on place.
The pieces of twine should be perpendicular to each other over the top of the hoop.
Loop one piece of twine around the center of the other piece so that they are joined together.
When it comes time to hang your mobile, hang it from the center loop created by your crossing twine.

, If you want nice, crisp lines, apply some painter's tape just above where you want the gold leaf to end.If you want a jagged line instead, you can skip this step., You don't absolutely have to do this, but many people find it easier to apply the gold leaf in smaller pieces. Whole sheets are typically harder to remove., Avoid getting any onto the painter's tape. You can use the brush-on kind or the spray-on kind. The brush on kind is great if you want a jagged line. The spray-on kind is great if you need to cove a large area. For small or delicate areas, use a gold leaf adhesive pen instead.Most types of gold leaf will have a paper backing. Leave this backing on the gold leaf.

, Once the glue dries, it will be tacky and ready for the gold leaf.Read the label on your gold leaf adhesive as each brand will be a little different., If your gold leaf has a paper backing, make sure that you place it gold-side-down onto the vase.If your gold leaf does not have a paper backing, it would be a good idea to handle it with tweezers so that it does not stick against your skin., If your gold leaf has a paper backing, gently rub your finger against it.If your gold leaf does not have a paper backing, gently brush the gold leaf with a soft, watercolor brush., Some of the gold leaf may be sticking up. If this happens, simply smooth it down with a soft, clean brush.If your gold leaf did not have a paper backing, you can skip this step., If the adhesive starts to lose its tack, you may have to apply more on. Keep applying the gold leaf, rubbing it, then peeling the paper backing away until your design is finished., Use a soft, clean brush, such as a watercolor brush, to gently brush away any excess gold leaf., Be very careful while doing this. If you get any chips in your work, you can try filling them in with extra gold leaf. The gold leaf will only stick to the areas that have adhesive on them., Extend the sealer just past the edges of the gold leaf onto the vase. This will help seal the gold leaf in further and prevent it from sticking. Don't worry if the sealer goes on milky; it will turn clear., As the sealer dries, it will turn clear. How long this takes depends on the type of sealer you used. Some only take 15 to 20 minutes to dry while others need a few hours."

This will get rid of any oils that might prevent the paint from sticking., You do not have to cover the entire vase with painter's tape. Instead, wrap some painter's tape around your vase, just above where you want the gold to end. You will paint everything below that line., Run a credit card over the tape. This ensures that the edges are firmly sealed against the glass. It will help prevent the paint from seeping under it., Shake the paint bottle well, the pour a small amount onto a plate. Use a foam brush to pick up the paint, then dab on a thin layer onto the glass. Don't worry if it looks sheer.Apply the paint going in the same direction, ie: up-and-down.
If you can't find any gold leaf paint, try gold enamel paint instead. It will give you a similar look., It's very important that you wait, or the paint may not cure properly. Once the two hours are up, apply another light coat of paint.Apply the paint going in the opposite direction, ie: left-and-right.
If the paint still looks sheer after this, let the paint dry another two hours, then add a third coat., How long it takes for the paint to dry depends on the type of paint you are using. In most cases, it will take about 24 hours.Refer to your bottle of paint for specific drying times.

You can peel the tape away after 2 to 3 hours., If you have not yet done so, carefully peel the tape away. Your lines should be crisp and neat. If there are any chips, fill them in using a thin brush and gold leaf paint. You can also use a gold leaf pen instead."

, Allow this dry before adding the wrappers.

, There are a few options in terms of colors––multi-colored, two or three colors, even just a single color, etc. The color choice will depend on what you have but it is a lot of fun to use many colors. However, two tone can also look really effective, especially if it's for a seasonal decoration, such as red and green for Christmas, orange and brown for Halloween, two pastel colors for Easter, etc.


For occasions such as Diwali, New Year (any culture) and birthdays, use as many colors as possible to make it appear festive.







, Attach it to the flowerpot by pressing into place. It's best to work from bottom to top; that way you can fix up any of the more obvious gaps with neat overlaps into the top of the container.


When adding each piece of foil, smooth out the foil from its center to its edges; this will remove air bubbles and ensure that it sticks on neatly.







, Leave the base and inside of the container free of wrappers.

, When dry, paint a coat of glue over the top of the whole creation. This will set it in place and protects it from scratches, scrapes and water when using the flowerpot. Allow to dry fully.

After you have measured your slate to the desired size place the slate(back of slate facing up toward you) on the slate cutter, and line the edge of the blade up with you line to be cut.,
If your slate is going to be a hanging slate now is when you want to drill the holes.,

Stand back and admire your hard work.",How to Make a Decorative Slate," You can purchase it at a local roofing supply house, or check listings for used slate from old houses, barns, etc., or you can go to a chain craft store if you are only looking to make one. Any more than one can be costly at a craft store. All full size roofing slates have the two holes in them. You can either cut around them or fill them in with epoxy and paint over them.;
, Once you know, turn the slate over to the back side and begin to measure it out to your desired size with your t square and marker. Couple of things here. You MUST do this on the back side of the slate (that's the flattest side), since this is the side you will be cutting from(never cut from the front), and also when using a t square you need to make sure the edges of the slate are straight to line the t square up properly or the whole thing will be off. Usually this is not an issue unless the slate has been used already.

, This is very tricky and please make sure you watch your figures, so that they don't get caught under the cutter blade.Hold the slate firmly in place with one hand and with the other begin to depress the cutter bar in a slow but steady fashion. Continue cutting until slate is the desired size. NOTE: If slate is hard to cut, or if it keeps breaking, your blade may need to be sharpened. (Safety goggles and mask should be worn.)

, Take your t square and measure out the holes. Mark with a marker.

, Hang slate over the edge of a table or counter, and then hold slate with one hand while drilling with the other. This picture is not the best example. It was just one person who needed to take the picture too. Not enough hands.

,, It can be a background color that you will be using or any old color you are going to paint over. If you don't want to use a base coat that's okay, but just know that it will be harder to paint straight lines because of the natural surface of the slate.

, Make sure to use your t square and ruler to mark out any border you may have, words, or any other object that may need to be straight or centered.

, Keep a few things in mind before you begin:


Make sure that your idea is a well thought out idea, and that you have the skill to paint it. However, if you're not the next Picasso no worries, do something that is simpler and within your means, or use a stencil. Slates are the perfect format to stencil on.






Use a good paint brushes to ensure clean edges.






Use a better quality acrylic paint. You want to avoid paints that are clumpy or are too thin, because they don't cover that well and are hard to control. Paint brushes and paint can be purchased at your local craft store or on line.







, EX. God Bless America or personalize it ""The (Last Names)"".

, Take the slate to a well ventilated area (preferably outside) lay it on a protected surface and get your mask back on. This is the part where you are going to seal it with a clear acrylic spray paint for protection, especially if it is going to be outside. Put several coats on just to be extra sure. NOTE: There are three types of finish with clear acrylic spray paint. Glossy, Satin, and Matte. Glossy really makes all the colors pop.

,, If this is a lawn and garden slate, at this point you are ready to put it in your wrought iron slate holder.

, Measure you leather cord out to be cut. For a slate this size, you would want to measure the cord about 15 inches (38.1 cm). Once you have done that thread one end of the cord through the back of the slate and tie in a Knot in the front.

Begin with pipe cleaners.,
Attach the deco mesh ribbon to the frame.,
Connect the ribbon to the next pipe cleaner.,
Connect the ribbon to each pipe cleaner.,
Add a second layer.,
Attach additional decorations.",How to Make a Deco Mesh Wreath1," Wrap several pipe cleaners around a metal wreath frame. Evenly place several colored pipe cleaners around a circular metal wreath frame, spacing the pipe cleaners roughly 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) apart.


Attach the pipe cleaners by simply twisting them onto the first or second wire from the center of the frame. Twist them enough so that they are securely held in place, but make sure to leave at least 2 inches (5 cm) of free pipe cleaner on each end.Use a color that roughly matches the color of your deco mesh ribbon so that the pipe cleaners blend in better.
The exact number of pipe cleaners you use will depend on the size frame you use.
Set aside any extra pipe cleaners you have, as they may come in handy later on.;
, Pinch one end of the ribbon together and fix it onto the wreath using one of the pipe cleaners. Place the pinched end in the center of one pipe cleaner and twist the pipe cleaner around the end to hold it in place.








You should use a large roll of fairly wide deco mesh ribbon. For a standard size wreath, 10-inch (25-cm) ribbon should suffice.
Arrange the deco mesh ribbon so that it overlaps the pipe cleaner, partially concealing it. The pinched end of the ribbon should rest along the frame. The remaining ribbon should come out from the other side, over the pipe cleaner knot, and over the end. This should conceal both the pipe cleaner and the end.

, Gather 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) of ribbon with your hands, pinching off the length with your fingers. Attach this pinched portion to the middle of the next pipe cleaner and twist the pipe cleaner around the ribbon to hold it down.








This should form a little ""bubble"" of deco mesh. If the bubble is uneven or appears flat, gently ""fluff it up"" by bending it with your fingers until the bubble appears even.

, Follow the same pattern to complete the wreath. Pinch off 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) of ribbon, attaching each length to the wreath by twisting the next sequential pipe cleaner around the pinched portion.








The pipe cleaners will be partially concealed by the bubbles that are formed from the ribbon. If you want to conceal them completely, use wire cutters to snip them off, leaving enough to prevent the twisted portions from unraveling.
Use the same length of ribbon for each segment. If not, the wreath will look uneven and sloppy.
Finish the wreath by cutting the ribbon and connecting the cut end to the starting pipe cleaner. Curl the end of the deco mesh ribbon into itself to maintain the proper shape and to prevent raw edges from being exposed.

, The wreath can be left as is, but if you want it to look fuller, attach a second layer of the same deco mesh ribbon to the frame.









Add more pipe cleaners, placing them in any empty spaces created by the first layer. Try to position the pipe cleaners evenly apart.
Fix the second layer to the frame with the same method used to fix the first layer on. Pinch even lengths of the ribbon and twist the new pipe cleaners around these pinched-off portions.

, Depending on the occasion, you can attach small ornaments, feathers, fabric flowers, small flags, or a variety of other crafting decorations to the wreath.









Use clear-drying craft glue to attach light decorations, like feathers. These decorations can be glued to the frame or to the ribbon.
Use a hot glue gun to attach heavier decorations, like ornaments, directly to the frame. Do not attach these decorations to the ribbon.
You could attach holiday ornaments to a green wreath. A large red bow can be glued to the bottom center.
You can make a Halloween wreath by attaching black ornaments, plastic spiders, and fake webbing to the wreath.

Attach your first color.,
Wrap the first ribbon around the frame.,
Add your second color.,
Weave in other colors.,
Glue on other embellishments.",How to Make a Deco Mesh Wreath2," Wrap the end of the deco mesh ribbon around the frame, holding it in place by wrapping floral wire or a thin piece of metal wire around the end.









Fold the end of the ribbon under itself to mask the raw edges.
Use wire that roughly matches the color of your metal frame or one of the ribbon colors.
For standard size wreaths with multiple colors, 6-inch (15-cm) deco mesh ribbon should be a good size., Wrap the ribbon around the frame. Take the length around the starting point, over the top of the frame, and then wrap it around the frame once more.









Each connecting point should be roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) apart. Space the points evenly apart.
The length of the ribbon used to reach the next connecting point should be about double the length of the frame leading to the connecting point. For instance, if the connecting points are 2 inches (5 cm) apart, you should use 4 inches (10 cm) of ribbon to reach that connecting point.
""Fluff"" or bunch up the deco mesh ribbon as you go along to create volume.
Tie the ribbon to each connecting point using thin wire.
Finish off the end by bringing the ribbon to the starting point and connect it to your original wire. Fold the end of the ribbon under itself to hide the raw edge., Position the second color ribbon so that it fills in the gaps left by the first ribbon. The metal frame should be mostly hidden by the time you finish.









The connecting points of the second ribbon will fall beneath the ""fluffed up"" or ""bubbled"" portions of the first ribbon.
Space the second ribbon in sections that are even with the sections used for the first ribbon.
Attach the second ribbon to the frame by using the same thin wire used to attach the first ribbon.

, Use additional deco mesh ribbon to fill in any remaining gaps on your wreath. Three or four colors will usually look best, but you can use fewer or more depending on the look you want.








You could also fill in the gaps using a color already used on your wreath.
Attach additional layers of ribbon using the same method used to attach the first two layers.

, Use a hot glue gun to attach heavy decorations, like ornaments, directly to the frame. You can use craft glue to attach lighter decorations, like feathers or foam letters, to the frame or to the ribbon itself.

Curl your deco mesh ribbon.,
Form bunches of deco mesh curls.,
Attach the first bunch.,
Attach the remaining bunches.,
Fluff the curls.",How to Make a Deco Mesh Wreath3," Unroll a length of deco mesh ribbon, curling it as you go so that it forms a tube. The diameter of the tube should be 9 to 10 inches (23 to 25 cm) wide. Cut the deco mesh to separate the curl from the rest of the spool.









You will need roughly 72 individual curls of deco mesh ribbon to create a full wreath. For a less full wreath, however, you can use 36 to 54 curls.
At minimum, this project requires two rolls of 21-inch by 10-yd (32-cm by 9.1-m) deco mesh ribbon. You can use more than this if you want more colors., Hold four curls of deco mesh ribbon together at the center. Fix them together with a pipe cleaner that matches one of the colors.








For a smaller, less full wreath, create bunches with two or three curls of deco mesh.
Twist the pipe cleaner around the deco mesh curls enough to hold them together securely. Leave enough excess pipe cleaner at the ends to fix the ribbons onto the wreath.

, Tie the center of the bunch to the inner ring of the frame by twisting the pipe cleaner ends around the wire. Twist the pipe cleaners enough to hold the deco mesh in place.









Fluff up the curls once the bunch is attached. Gently bend and position the curls so that half face inward diagonally and half face outward diagonally.
For this project, a 24-inch (61-cm) metal wreath frame works best., Place the bunches around the frame, spacing them apart evenly and twisting them in place using the remaining pipe cleaner ends.








The bunches should be placed a little more than 1 inch (2.5-cm) apart from one another.
It may help to leave a little bit of ""wiggle room"" between the pipe cleaner and the metal frame. Doing so will allow you to glide the bunches around and reposition them as needed. You can always make the twist tighter after the bunches are all arranged as you would like them to be.
Attach the bunches to both the inner and outer wires of the frame for a full wreath.

, Bend and reposition the curls so that some face diagonally inward and others face diagonally outward. The end result should be a full wreath with no empty space in the center and none of the wire frame visible.

While pinching the pleat together, put a staple through its width to hold it in place.

, Lay the small ribbon down, then place the medium and long pieces on top. The medium piece should be positioned above the long one.

The folded side of the small ribbon should face up, and the length of the ribbon should run vertically.
Place the long ribbon on top of the small one, roughly halfway along the vertical center. The tails along either side of the accordion plead should bend downward.
Place the medium ribbon on top of the small one so that it sits just above the large piece. Reposition the pieces as needed, allowing 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the short ribbon to show above the medium ribbon.

, Bring the crosswise ends of the short ribbon together, pulling the ribbon over the medium and large pieces on the process.

Dip the pieces of newspaper into the glue mix and smooth them all over the bowl, both inside and out.
Let the first layer dry.

, Let dry between each layer.

, Hold the edges of the plastic wrap to help ease the paper bowl away from the real bowl. Set the real bowl aside to wash later.

, Paint the bowl one neutral color (white is an easy choice) to provide a neat background. Allow to dry.

, You can glue them in a pattern or simply add them at random. If creating a pattern, it's a good idea to sketch this out on paper first so that you have a guide to follow before sticking the pieces in place.


Be prepared to cut the paper decorations to fit your intended design. Overlapping them is also another option.

, Let dry. Once dry, it is ready for display.

Make the paper pulp.,
Choose a medium sized plastic or ceramic bowl.,
Turn the bowl over.,
Spread the pulp over the outside of the bowl.,
Set aside to dry in a warm place.,
Once you're sure the bowl is dry, separate it from the bowl mold.,
Paint the bowl in a decorative color.",How to Make a Bowl3,"


Tear strips of newspaper into small pieces.
Fill a bucket about a quarter of the way with the pieces.
Add hot water to cover the pieces.
Let cool. Once cooled, mash with a wooden spoon until the pulp turns mushy.
Process in the food processor in small batches. Each processing should end in a smooth pulp.
Place the processed pulp into a sieve. Press down hard to remove all liquid.
Add one cup of PVA glue to the pulp in a bowl. Mix well. The pulp will keep in a sealed container in the refrigerator for a few days.

, Cover the bowl with plastic kitchen wrap.


Be sure to continue the wrap over the rim of the bowl.

, If possible, place on a stand, such as a pitcher or jug.

, Make sure it covers every part of the bowl. Aim to keep the layer even all over, at least 1cm/1/2 inch thick.

, Leave for at least 2 days, possibly longer in a more humid environment.

, Peel off the kitchen plastic wrap.

, Add patterns if wished. The bowl is ready for display once it has dried. As with a papier-mâché bowl, this bowl is suitable only for display or holding objects, not for eating from.

"
"
Find a suitable bowl shaped object.,
Find a suitable stand.,
Glue the bowl object to the stand object.,
Place on display.",How to Make a Bowl4," Here there are limitless possibilities, so it's difficult to suggest any one thing. But some ideas include pan or pot lids, the cover of an old round fan, packaging, lids off household objects, lampshades, toys, etc. Rummage around and be creative in your choices.

, The bowl-like object will usually be best placed on some sort of a stand to keep it up off the display surface. Again, many things could work but some ideas include old cups and glasses, pencil holders, packaging, poster tubes cut down, toys, unwanted gadgets, etc.

, In some cases, it may be best to screw the two objects together for best stability.


Always check that the items sit together without rocking before attaching.

, It's something odd to be admired!

"
"
Find a large unwanted doily.,
Cover a bowl in plastic kitchen wrap, ensuring that it goes over the rim.,
Choose between fabric stiffener or sugar water to stiffen the bowl.,
Place the dipped, wet doily over the bowl.,
Set aside in a warm, dry place.,
Lift the bowl gently, using the kitchen plastic wrap to help lever it off the molding bowl.,
Use.",How to Make a Bowl5," It should be in very good to excellent condition––if it's stained, pass on it. Doilies can be purchased from thrift stores, antique dealers and many online auction sellers.

, Before finalizing the bowl choice, check that the doily sits over it well. If not, choose one of a better size. Turn the bowl upside down in readiness for covering with the doily.

, Either will work, choose according to whatever you have available. Note that sugar water may attract insects if stored for a long period of time. In each case, work over a surface where drips won't be a problem.


Pour fabric stiffener into another bowl or basin. Dip the doily into this bowl or basin.
Make sugar water. Dissolve 3-5 tablespoons of sugar in boiling water. Heat without boiling, until all of the granules disappear. Dip the doily into this mixture. Make sure it is thoroughly covered.

, Adjust to ensure that it is sitting evenly around the bowl––if not, you'll end up with a lopsided doily bowl shape.

, Let dry for approximately 48 hours. Don't touch until at least 24 hours have passed by.

, Let stand until you're absolutely sure the whole surface of the doily is completely dry.


Trim off any plastic wrap or fabric stiffener that is stuck to the doily.

, Add candies, sewing bits and pieces (a few old wooden cotton reels look superb) or a pile of ribbons. It's a lovely item just by itself on display too.

Decide what colors and types of feathers you'd like to form the wreath.,
Plan the design before making the wreath.,
Follow the design plan to add the feathers to the wreath base.,
Add a ribbon or length of string for the hanger.",How to Make a Feather Wreath1," Purchase or find these feathers before commencing the project. If using feathers from outdoors, clean and dry them before use.
, Work out in advance how the feathers are to sit around the wreath. Some examples include:

Arranging the feathers all standing upright around the wreath.
Overlapping the feathers sideways around the wreath.
Making varied patterns with the feathers, perhaps based on color (blues, greens, browns, etc.) or in patterned shapes such as crosses or zigzags.

, Place the wreath base on the table or work bench. Methodically work around the wreath, gluing the feathers in place according to the design.

If not overlapping the feathers, it's a good idea to wrap the wreath base in ribbon first, to take care of any gaps that might occur between feathers. Choose a color similar to that of the feathers.

, Tie in place. The wreath is now ready for hanging on the front door or anywhere else."
"
Prepare the pipe cleaner.,
Form a small loop.Fold the end of the ribbon to create a loop measuring roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) in diameter.,
Create a bigger loop to one side.Fold the ribbon to the left of the center loop, creating a loop approximately three times as large as the first.,
Mirror the loop on the other side.,
Make additional loops as desired.,
Form one final loop.,
Tighten the pipe cleaner around the center.,
Cut the ribbon.,
Attach the bow to the wreath.",How to Make a Bow for a Wreath2," Bend one pipe cleaner near its center, forming a loose U-shape.

A piece of floral wire or other craft wire would also work if you do not have pipe cleaners.
Set this bent pipe cleaner aside for later use.

, This loop will become the center of your bow.

Slide your thumb into the loop and use it to hold the overlapping end down. You'll need to continue holding this area in place while creating the rest of the bow.
Note that you do not need to cut the ribbon before forming the bow since you'll be working from the end.

,

The fold of this loop should run parallel to the folds of your center loop.
Pinch this loop together at the same point you have the center loop pinched. Continue holding the center down while working.

, Bring the ribbon beneath the center loop and out to its right side. Fold the ribbon again to create another loop that is identical to the second.

As before, the fold of this loop must run parallel to the other folds, and you'll need to continue pinching down the center of the bow to prevent the loops from unraveling.
If you use one-sided ribbon, you'll need to twist the ribbon at the center of the bow before forming the loop; otherwise, the underside of the ribbon will show. Doing so is not necessary for double-sided ribbon, however.

, Use the same technique to create more loops on the left and right sides of the bow, making them all identical in size with one another.

You should be able to create a full bow with four loops on either side, but you can alter the final count according to your own preferences. Keep the same loop count on both sides of the bow, though.

, Bring the ribbon to the back center of the bow, then create one large loop at the back measuring twice as long as the width of the bow.

As with the other loops, hold the end of this loop in place by pinching it at center of the bow.

, Insert the bend of the prepared pipe cleaner into the center loop, then twist the ends together to gather the loops.

When you slide the pipe cleaner over the center, the loose ends should hang down over side layers and down past the lowest fold.
Continue holding the folds with one hand while twisting the pipe cleaner ends together with your other hand. As you twist, the loops should gather together at the center. Release the center once the pipe cleaner is tight enough to keep it secure.

, Detach the ribbon from its roll and cut open the final loop.

Flip the bow to its back, then cut the ribbon near the secured base. Doing so should separate the bow from the rest of the ribbon on its roll.
Cut open the center of the large bottom loop, splitting it apart into a tail. Trim the tail ends down to your desired length.

, The bow is done and ready to use. To attach it to a wreath, position it over the wreath and twist the pipe cleaner ends onto the wreath frame."
"
Cut the tailpiece.,
Gather the center of a second piece.,
Repeat the gathers to your desired fullness.,
Detach the bow from the roll.,
Tie the tail onto the body.,
Slip wire beneath the knot.,
Attach the bow to the wreath.",How to Make a Bow for a Wreath3," Unroll and cut 5 to 6 feet (1.5 to 1.8 m) of deco mesh. This portion will be used for the tail; set it aside while you work on the body of the bow.Deco mesh naturally begins to curl when cut, so you'll need to straighten it. Hold the middle of the piece, then use your hands to straighten the length on either side of the center.
Even after you release the tail, the center bend should still loosely remain in place. Do not straighten this bend.

, Unroll more deco mesh, then pinch the center of the outer edge inward toward the roll, creating a gather.You do not need to cut the deco mesh yet, but you should unroll another 6 feet (1.8 m) or so to work with during this step.
Gather the center using your entire hand rather than your fingers. Place the edge of the deco mesh in your palm, then use all four fingers to grab as much of mesh as possible and draw it back into your palm, bringing it to meet the edge.

, Without releasing your first gather, continue making consecutive gathers down the length of the deco mesh using the same pinching process.

Hold all of the formed gathers in the same hand, and make sure that each gather remains in the middle of the width.
As you gather the deco mesh, the bow shape should gradually form. Continue gathering as much deco mesh as needed to create the level of fullness you prefer. You can usually create a large, fluffy bow with 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m).

, After forming the body of the bow, cut the deco mesh just beneath the final gather, separating the bow from the rest of the roll.

To prevent the gathers from losing their shape, continue holding them with the same hand and use your other hand to cut the mesh.

, Take the tailpiece and wrap its middle around the center of the bow body. Tie the tail into a simple knot at the back of the bow.

Work carefully, wrapping the center of the bow directly where you've been holding it.
A simple knot should be enough to hold the gathers in place, but pull it tightly to make sure that everything remains secure.
Straighten out the wrapped center and the tails as needed after securing the tail to the body.

, Cut 6 inches (15 cm) of craft wire, then insert it beneath the knot at the back center of the bow.

Center the wire beneath this knot, then twist its ends together above the knot once or twice to hold it in place.

, The deco mesh bow is finished and ready to use. You can attach it to the wreath by twisting the craft wire ends directly onto the wreath frame."

",How to Make a Coin Vase," Choose your vase not only based on room design but also the number of coins you would like to use. Also, take into consideration not only the number, but size of the coins. Larger coins can command a larger amount of space.;
, Determine which coins will make it onto the vase and which coins you’d rather either cash in or save. Add and/or subtract to your collection based on your project requirements.

, You’ll need matte black spray paint, hot glue gun and glue sticks and newspaper to cover surfaces.


Cover flat surface with newspaper and spray paint the entire surface of the vase. Only cover the outside of the vase and consider painting two coats, allowing ample dry time between the two.






Heat the glue gun toward the end of the second coat’s dry time to allow it enough time to heat up.







, Add a dab of glue to one side of the coin and adhere it to the top, rim of the vase. Work your way around the rim with the coins until you reach the end.

, You should have evenly spaced rows of coins, completely covering the vase. Work your way downward until coins cover the vase all the way to the base.

Do several light layers to cover. It doesn't matter if some feathers remain white, as this adds to the sense of baby chicken feathers., Fluff the feathers with your fingers. This step is important to prevent them from sticking together in a mass and looking lifeless. They'll also dry faster when separated.,, Try to get the feathers to fluff into the center and out to the sides, to give the wreath greater dimension., Make a coiled end in a piece of wire, leaving the rest straight and long enough to pierce through the wreath. Attach the plushie by pushing the wire piece through the plushie and into the wreath, at the point where you wish the plushie to sit. Push until the coil sits against the fabric of the plushie, then make another coil in the wire, trimming off any excess, leaving the rest of the wire sticking firmly into the wreath behind the coil stopper.

Alternatively, if using two plushies close together, wind the back wires around each other to keep them firmly in place.

, Make or purchase a large bow and attach with a fern pin., If hanging, add a ribbon loop for hanging or simply lean the wreath against a wall or other item."

Can't find any driftwood? Use a branch or a dowel instead.;
, You will need one length of string for each hole that you made.


The strings don't all have to be the same length.

, Use a tight, double knot, and don't trim off the tail end.For a stronger hold, slip a crimp bead over the knot, and pinch it shut with a pair of pliers.Don't have bells? Use anything else that will make noise when clinked together. Metal charms, shells, and keys would all work great!

, Make sure to push the first couple of beads through both strands of string so that the tail end from the knot doesn't stick out. You can string the beads randomly or use a pattern. Leave a few inches/centimeters at the other end of the string empty.


Consider adding some metal and wood beads for an interesting effect., At this point, take a look at the chime, and decide whether or not you are happy with the length. If something is too long, pull a few beads off. You can make your wind chime look more interesting by varying the lengths.

, Make sure that the bead is large enough so that it doesn't slip through the hole in the wood.The bead will help keep the string in place.

, Thread it back through the last couple of beads on your chime, then cut off the excess., Tie the ends of the twine to itself with a knot to secure it.If you'd like something fancier, drill a hole into each end of the driftwood, then insert a small hook. Attach the hooks to a delicate chain.

Use your Book of Shadows as you please.",How to Decorate Your Book of Shadows," Take care to choose a book of a decent size; if it's too small, you might run out of space but if it's too large, it might be hard to hold. Think about how you will use it before selecting the book. While any style of notebook might work for you, you can also find books made specially to be a Book of Shadows in occult or magic stores. Some considerations to help your decision include:


The binding: Do you want it to be covered in fabric or spiral bound?
Lined or unlined: While lined makes it easy to write on, unlined gives you greater freedom when writing or drawing and making diagrams.
Recycled: It is nice to consider the environment and choose a book that has minimal impact, in line with your nature-based beliefs.
Cover: If you wish to decorate it, a blank cover is easiest, although you can always cover any printed design with blank paper first, then create your own design over the top.;
, There are various options for decorating the book, either by painting or drawing, sticking on symbols or printed and covering them with contact paper or using an existing Book of Shadows image and gluing it in place. When designing the decorations for your cover, the following ideas might be of help in inspiring you:


Triple moon goddess
Pentagram
Infinity sign
Your astrological symbol
Planetary symbols
A cross (If it goes with your religion)
Clavicula Nox
Or anything else you think would be appropriate.

, While you don't have to divide the Book, you can do so if wished. Use dividers and tape them in place. Divide your book into four sections:


Spells
Astral projection journal (such as a dream journal)
Dream journal
Cheat sheets (references for incense, herbs, moon phases, etc.)

You can use a plastic embroidery hoop or a wooden one. If you use a wooden embroidery hoop, you can paint it any color you wish.

, You can leave wooden embroidery hoops plain for a rustic effect, or you can paint them with acrylic paint. Painting plastic hoops is not recommended because the paint is more likely to chip off.


If you will be using this wind chime outside, spray the hoop with a clear, acrylic sealer once the paint has dried.

, You can have as many or as few chimes as you want. They can all be the same length, or they can be different lengths. The best type of string to use for this would be nylon beading thread or fishing line.

, You can use small bells, metal findings, keys, or anything that will make a sound when clinked together. Some people like to use vintage spoons!

, Be sure to slip the first couple of beads through both the string and the tail end. This will keep everything looking neat, and prevent the tail end of the knot from sticking out. Leave a few inches/centimeters at the end of each string empty.

, Wrap the string around the hoop a few times tightly, so that the last bead bumps up against the bottom edge. Tie the tail end to the string in a tight, double knot, then feed it back down through the beads.

, You will be using this to hang your wind chime, so choose something sturdy. Fishing line or twine would work well, but ordinary thread or yarn won't.

, Wrap the string around the hoop a few times, then tie it to itself. While the beaded strings are hanging down, these strings should be hanging up. Try to space these as evenly as you can.

, Gather the loose ends of your strings together, and check that the tension is even. Tie them together into a single knot, then slip them over a hook. Use the hook to hang your wind chime.

Consider customizing your board.,
Give your board a fresh look by covering the cork part with fabric.,
Make your board more colorful by painting the cork part.,
Stencil your board.,
Add a border around the cork part, just inside the frame.,
Paint the frame.,
Decorate the frame.,
Make your own bulletin board using a corkboard and a fancy frame.",How to Decorate a Bulletin Board2," Most bulletin boards are plain. They consist of a simple wooden frame with an even simpler cork board. Your board does not have to be so simple. You can paint it or cover it with fabric to make it even more special. This section will give you some customization ideas. You do not have to use all of the ideas in this section. Choose one or two that appeal the most to you.

, Measure the height and length of the cork part. Do not include the frame in your measurement. Cut a piece of fabric according to your measurement. Cover the entire cork part with Mod Podge using a paintbrush or foam brush. Press the fabric down onto the Mod Podge and smooth out any wrinkles. Let the Mod Podge dry before you use your board.


You can also glue your fabric down using spray adhesive. Cover the frame with painter's tape first, then spray both the fabric and the cork part with glue. Press the fabric down onto the board and smooth out any wrinkles. Remove the tape.You can also use wrapping paper for this. Keep in mind that any holes you make in the paper using pushpins or thumbtacks, they will stay.

, Cover the frame part with painter's tape. Next, paint the entire cork part using acrylic paint or spray paint. Remove the tape, then wait for the paint to dry. Depending on the brand you used, this may take anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours. You may need several coats of paint to get the texture and color you want. Wait each coat to dry before applying a new one.


Use a foam brush or paintbrush to apply the acrylic paint. If your board is very large, use a foam paint roller instead.You can also use chalkboard paint. Paint your board with a paint primer first, then apply two to three coats of chalkboard paint.Once the paint dries, cover the entire board with chalk, then wipe the chalk off. This is known as ""priming.""

, Place a stencil down where you'd like your design. Use a foam brush or a stencil brush to tap some acrylic paint over the stencil. Carefully remove the stencil before the paint dries. Allow the paint to dry (at least 20 minutes for most brands) before you put anything on it.If the stencil moves too much, tape down the edges with painter's tape.
Consider painting the cork part a solid color first. Wait for the paint to dry, then stencil designs over it using a contrasting color., Cut four pieces of ribbon: two for the height, and two for the length. Glue the ribbon down onto the cork part, just inside the frame, using fabric glue. Allow the glue to dry before you use the board.You can also use washi tape or any other patterned scrapbooking tape. You can buy them in the scrapbooking section of an arts and crafts store. Make sure the width of the tape will match the border of your pin board.

, Place painter's tape on the inside edges of the bulletin board, so that the frame is still showing but the cork part is partly covered. Paint the frame using acrylic paint and a paintbrush or foam brush. Remove the tape before the paint dries. Let the paint dry before you use the board. This can take anywhere between 20 minutes to two hours, depending on the brand you used.

, Sometimes, even painted frames look a little bland. You can fix this by adding some texture. Here are some ideas on what you can do to make the frame part look more interesting:


Cut a strip from each tape, making sure each one matches the length of one side of your pin board.
Place washi tape or any other patterned tape over the frame.
Glue ribbon over the frame using fabric glue.
Tape the sides first and then the top and bottom.
Get a ruler and smooth over the tape. On the inner edge of the board and tape, use the edge of the ruler to push the edges of the tape down evenly.
Use hot glue, super glue, or tacky glue to attach rhinestones or buttons to the frame.
Cover the frame with some Mod Podge, then shake glitter onto it. Cover the frame again using glossy Mod Podge to seal the glitter in.

, Buy a large sheet of cork from an arts and crafts store. Next, buy a frame that fits the cork. Take the glass and backing out of the frame. Draw a line of glue inside the frame, then press the corkboard down into it.

Base the colors and decorations on your board off of a season.,
Hang the students' artwork on it.This is a great way to make your board look more colorful.",How to Decorate a Bulletin Board3," This section will give you a few tips on how you can decorate your classroom bulletin board. You do not have to use all of the ideas in this section. Choose a few that appeal the most to you.


You can buy most of the supplies in a teacher supply store. Some well-stocked art stores may also carry these supplies.

, Most classroom bulletin boards use solid-colored butcher paper. This hides the corkboard and make it look more colorful. You can be more creative and use wrapping paper or colorful fabric instead.


Wrapping paper is great because it adds a lot of texture and pattern. You might want to use a solid-colored background and letters, as well as large, simple shapes, when decorating it. This will keep the designs from clashing.
Fabric is great because pins and staples won't leave holes in it. It also won't fade, rip, or tear. If it wrinkles, all you have to do is iron it out., Most borders will be either solid-colored or patterned (and usually based off of a holiday, such as hearts for Valentine's day and shamrocks for St. Patrick's day). However, you can use almost anything you want for the border. Here are some ideas:


Consider layering the border. Lay two to three pieces on top of each other.Each bottom piece should be sticking out from beneath the upper one by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).
Use paper cutouts, such as hearts, snowflakes, leaves, or clover, to make your border. They should be smaller than your hand. Try to use different shades to add variety. For example, if you are using hearts, use red and pink paper.
Use other items for borders, such as pompoms, playing cards, fake flowers, or even crumpled tissue paper.

, Most bulletin boards will use the same color and font for each word or phrase. You can make your board look more interesting by using different colors, sizes, and fonts for the letters. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use a different font for each word. Make one word bold and the other cursive or italic.
Use a different color or pattern for each word.
Make the words you want to emphasize larger.
Make your own unique letters by tracing letters onto patterned scrapbook paper, and then cutting the letters out.
Get a pennant banner (it looks like paper squares or rectangles attached to a long string) and write each letter on each pennant.

, This is a great way to tie in what you are teaching at the moment to the rest of the classroom. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If the class is learning about ancient Egypt, write the message on the board using hieroglyphics. You can use colored butcher paper to create a desert scene, including sand, palm trees, and pyramids.
For an English classroom, you could make the bulletin board book or grammar related. If your students are studying a particular book, then base the bulletin board off of that book. Include the name of the book, as well as a phrase. You can even include a symbol or some characters from the book as well.

, These sorts of decorations can stay up for the entire month that the holiday takes place in. They are a great way to make your classroom look more festive. Here are some ideas to get you started:


For Valentine's day, use a soft pink or white for the background, and red for the borders and letters. Consider decorating the board with a Valentine's day craft project that the kids did. Leave the decorations up for all of February.
For Halloween, use orange for the background, and black for the boards and letters. Decorate the board with black cats and bats. You can even add a cobweb and a spider to the corner. Leave the decorations up for all of October.
For St. Patrick's day, green for the background, and white for the letters and board. Use colored butcher paper to create a rainbow and a pot of gold. Leave the decorations up for all of March.

, Students have to spend a lot of their time indoors. This does not mean that they have to miss out on all that the seasons have to offer. You can decorate your board according to the season. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Use lots of earth tones for fall. For example, use tan for the background and red or orange for the borders and letters. Staple paper pumpkins and red, orange, and yellow fall leaves to the board.
Use lots of blue and white for winter. For example, use light blue for the background and white for the borders and letters. Create a snow scene using white butcher paper and lots of paper snowflakes. You can also use green butcher paper to create pine trees.
Use bright colors for spring. For example, use light blue for the background and a cheerful yellow for the border and letters. Decorate the board using bright green paper for the grass, and pink, purple, and white paper for the flowers.
Use tropical colors for summer. Use a light blue for the background and yellow for the border and letters. You can decorate the board with colorful hibiscus flowers, seashells, palm trees, and a sun.

, It will also save you the trouble of having to buy supplies to decorate it with. Try not to staple the student's artwork to the board, as this can create holes and ruin it. Instead, try to use some poster putty instead. It comes off of paper easily. Most people use it to stick posters to walls.


If you must staple the artwork, try staple only the top of the artwork. Do not get too close to the edge, however; the art piece by rip off, creating a tear in the student's artwork. This could end in lots of tears.

Stencil basic designs onto your mirror.,
Try a cozy ""Alice in Wonderland"" theme.,
Create a classy Tuscan look.,
Go for a natural, foresty look.,
Make a mosaic frame.,
Go for an elegant, feminine look.,
Try a by-the-sea theme.,
Try a colorful, fun button design.,
Make a Christmas mirror.,
Got for a sports theme.,
Try a travel theme.",How to Decorate a Mirror," The most simple way to decorate a mirror and take it from basic to amazing is to stencil a design onto the glass. Buy a stencil from your local art store, cover the areas that won't be stenciled with newspaper and tape everything into place, and then use spray paint that's designed for glass to paint your design. You can also use non-traditional stencils, like paper doilies, or reverse stencils, like a leaf.;
, You can make an adorable Alice in Wonderland themed mirror with some really basic supplies. Get a doll's tea set and use hot glue to attach a teacup to the edge of the mirror. Next, get a cheap pocket watch and attach Velcro at the back and where you'd like it to be on the mirror (the opposite corner from the teacup works well). Use Modge Podge or another decoupage glue to cover the remainder of the mirror in teabag tags in an artful design that appeals to you. You can tape playing cards to a string and display it like a garland along the bottom of the mirror as well.

, Use wine corks cut in half to create a frame around the mirror. Then, hot glue fake grape bunches and leaves to the corners or edge of the mirror in a way that you think looks nice. If you can find charms that look like wine bottles, those can also be a nice addition.

, You can also use natural materials if that would work better for your style. Hot glue together twigs in a woven pattern, or use other material like stones or fake leaves. You can also combine all three to create your own mini forest. Rocks on the bottom, twigs on the sides, and leaves at the top will look like your mirror sprouted up in the middle of a tree!

, You can buy mosaic tiles from your local art store or make your own using broken pottery pieces. Use glue or mortar to attach the pieces to your mirror. Just make sure to let it fully set before hanging it and to hang it on something that is strong enough to support the weight if you used mortar.

, You can create a mirror fit for a princess. Start by covering the frame in fancy paper using Modge Podge. Then, using hot glue, attach strings of pearls, pink beads, and paper flowers to the paper-covered frame in an artful way.

, This classic mirror design is easy to get for yourself at home. Buy some rope from your local hardware store and use hot glue to create a frame for the mirror by wrapping the rope around and creating a design. Then you can add other features, like gluing on a dried starfish as a centerpiece at the bottom or top.

, If you want to bring more color into your home, a button frame mirror is a great way to go. Buy a large batch of random buttons off of ebay or from an antique store and use hot glue to attach them to the edge of the mirror in a design that appeals to you. Try to layer and stagger them to create a feathered effect.

, You can make a mirror that looks great for the holidays with just a few easy items that are found at your local craft store during the holidays. String a few light ornaments on a piece of twine or ribbon and attach the ribbon at the two top corners of the mirror so that the ornaments hang. Surround the edges of the mirror with real or fake Christmas tree branches taped to the wall. You can finish off the look by tying a beautiful red Christmas bow and taping it to the bottom center of the mirror.

, You can make a perfect mirror for your man's man cave or even just your own room by getting your mirror custom fit to the inside measurement of a tennis racket. Glue it into place and then hang the racket on a wall. Another method would be to spray paint bottle caps with your team's colors and glue them around the outside of the mirror.

, Another easy, timeless theme is a travel theme. This can be customized to match a trip that is significant to you, or be generalized. Use Modge Podge to attach pieces of a map to cover the frame of the mirror. Once it's dry, tack or tape up postcards and artfully distribute stamps around the frame. You can even draw fake passport stamps on the frame for added flair!

Plan it out.,
Designing an artsy color palette.,
Choose your furniture.,
Choose your lighting.,
Wall art and décor.",How to Decorate a Red Room," Before setting out to design your red space, you must have an idea of what you want it to be and have a place to gather inspiration from. You can look in interior decorating magazines, on websites such as Apartment Therapy and Pinterest, or even draw inspiration from shows on channels such as HGTV and DIY.;
, Just because your room is red doesn't mean you need to be restrained to red and its various shades when planning the color scheme of your room. Mixing colors that complement red, like black, white, and blue, will leave your room fresh and vibrant. Remember to stick to light colors, preferably creams and whites, to complement your shade of red, however, unless you are going for a heavy, dark look. Also keep in mind that with red, since it is such a loud color, less is often more.

, Often contemporary, white furniture (think Ikea and Scandinavian designs) looks best with the color red. So whilst shopping for furniture, look for sleek designs with sharp features, minimal detailing, and clean lines. Also consider metal (perhaps a wrought-iron headboard) for an edgy feel or vintage furniture if you have in mind a more romantic space.

, What's so great about designing a red room is that red is thought to be a very dramatic color, associated primarily with theatre and the other various performing arts. So if you choose to go bold, then it will certainly fit in. Especially with lighting - in a room that's been painted red, strand of christmas lights and other bright, overbearing lights will fit in quite nicely. When shopping for lights, try to draw inspiration from movies and plays, or sets for plays and movies.

, Ideas for things to hang up on your walls include vintage movie posters, pictures of black-and-white actors or actresses, modern painting by artists like Jackson Pollock and the like, and mirrors. When looking for frames, try to pick up frames that are more neutral and simple to contrast with the overall dramatic feel of the room. Feather boas, when draped on dressers or floor-to-ceiling mirrors also add a bit of pizzazz. When looking for statement pieces, think glitter, sparkly, and shiny.

Devise a budget.,
Get a colour scheme.,
Know what needs to go in your salon.,
Make a plan for where your furniture will go.,
Come up with a name for your salon, make posters and business cards and hand them out to everyone you know.,
Place all your furniture into your salon.",How to Decorate a Beauty Salon," There's no point going to Ikea with a rough idea and getting everything that looks good. Do you have enough money to run the place? Do you already have the place where the salon would be? Are you qualified? Do you know anyone who is qualified? Once you start to employ other colleagues, you're going to need to start paying them. Find out a good starting wage. Make sure you have enough money for everyone else as well.;
, Is you salon going to be red? White? Blue? White and blue? Rainbow? What parts of your salon are going to be different colours? Are you going to go for a posh look for your salon, or maybe diamonds and pink? Whatever you choose, choose wisely. Make sure you write this all down. Once you have the budget and colour scheme, proceed to step 3.

, Look at the 'Things You Will Need' section below, don't figure out where your furniture is going to go yet, just figure out what you need and make sure everything will fit in your salon. Everything we have included is a definite must, so make sure to include it in your salon. Once you've written down what you need, go to a store like Ikea and see if you can buy your furniture there. If you can't, keep looking but if you can, take pictures and notes of every item you need.

, Everything must have it's place. If it looks too cramped, you're going to need to make the salon bigger. If it looks too spaced out, add more furniture. When you've made your plan, make sure you're happy. If you're working with other people and don't like their idea's, speak up. It might just save your business.

, Make a website, if you know how to and make sure it looks professional and neat. Make sure your name isn't tacky, doesn't offend someone and make sure that it isn't taken already! Search online, look carefully.

, Make sure everything is in place. Make sure you've installed sinks, shelves for your shampoo and conditioner, bottles of hairspray, nail polish and nail products. Take a picture of your new salon! Enjoy it, spend time there, employ the right people, hold meetings, hold interviews.

Allow time for tack to develop.,

Fold back the tissue paper to expose the copper leaf.,
Remove the excess leaf.,
Look for and fix “holidays” on the surface.,
Seal and protect the surface.",How to Copper Leaf," Put strips of low-tack painters tape on any areas of the surface you don’t plan to gild with copper leaf. This will “mask” these areas off and protect them during the process. Run your hand along the unmasked surface areas. If you feel a lot of roughness or surface blemishes, use 220 grit sandpaper to sand it to your desired smoothness.Roughness and blemishes will show through applied cooper leaf. Unless you are going for a rustic look, you’ll want to smooth these areas out first.Canvas, wood, Masonite, paper, glass, plastic, metal and any other surface that can be made non-absorbent can be used for copper leafing.
Put down newspaper to protect the work area and floor as you work.;
, Wipe down the surface with a tack cloth to remove leftover sanding dust. Use a paint brush to apply the primer of your choice. Common options for primer are gesso and various kinds of paint (acrylic, casein, egg tempura, latex, house, oil). Apply the primer slowly and carefully, since any brush strokes you leave behind will show through the copper leaf once it’s applied.Priming the surface makes it smooth and non-absorbent, both of which are necessary prior to copper leafing it.If you plan to burnish the surface, it must be made absolutely smooth first.
Burnishing is when you polish metallic leaf until it's very shiny. Consider using a burnish primer created specifically for this process.

, “Bole” is paint that is applied to be the base color for the surface to be copper leafed. Use a paint brush to apply the base color of your choice. Applying a base color, or undercolor, can help enhance the finished look by slightly changing the overall color tone. Red, grey and ochre are popular choices for bole. After applying the bole, allow it to dry completely before moving on to the size application.A deep red bole can add warmth to the final look.
Black and grey can create a colder, “hard” tone.
Yellow ochre can even out the surface appearance and help to disguise cracks or blemishes.

, “Size” is the adhesive material applied to the surface that makes the copper leaf stick to it. There are two options available – water-based or oil-based size. Oil-based size is the most traditional choice. Quick-dry oil size reaches tack (the required “stickiness” to adhere the copper leaf) in about two hours. It is meant to be used for small projects or whenever you have a limited time frame to work within. Slow-set oil size will reach tack in ten to twelve hours. It is intended for larger projects that require a lot of work time.Water-based size is an alternative to the more typical oil-based size. It comes to tack within twenty minutes, and remains workable for about thirty hours.Water-based size is not burnishable. If you plan to burnish the surface, use oil-based size.

, Adhesive size goes on wet. Use a paint brush to apply the size carefully to the surface. Even application is desirable for best results. Use the paint brush to work the size to an even coat as you spread it over the surface. Make sure you cover all areas that you want to gild.


Copper leaf will not stick to a surface that does not have size on it., Once applied, you must give the size the proper amount of time to reach tack before applying the copper leaf. Tack times vary based on which kind of size you use.Following the correct tack time procedure will greatly affect the final look of your project.


For the most professional looking results, read and follow the tack time instructions precisely.

, Gently run the back of your knuckle over a small area of the surface. Listen for a squeak sound, which indicates tackiness has been reached. If the size is still too wet to apply the copper leaf, it will come off on your skin. When it’s ready, it will feel sticky but will not come off on your skin.Monitor the size carefully and test the tack every half hour until it has been reached.


Once the size becomes too dry, you will have missed your opportunity to apply the copper leaf. It must be applied to a surface with proper tack.
If you live in a very warm or dry environment, keep in mind that tack time may be reduced.

, Copper leaf sheets come in booklets and are separated from one another by protective tissue paper. Expose your first sheet of copper leaf and carefully lay it onto the sized surface. It will stick immediately. Gently pull the booklet away and let the rest of the sheet fall flat onto the surface. Press down firmly to adhere the copper leaf.Wear cotton gloves so the copper leaf doesn't stick to your fingers.
Work in a draft-free area. Copper leaf is extremely thin and can be easily disturbed by a draft., Use your fingers to tap down the copper leaf to ensure it is fully adhered to the surface. Then use a soft paint brush or cotton ball to brush away any excess leaf. Continue the same process of exposing the sheet, dropping it, tapping it down and brushing away the excess until you’ve covered the whole surface.

, Once you've covered the entire surface of your project with copper leaf, inspect it closely. Holidays are places where the copper leaf didn’t adhere properly. Use more copper leaf to fill these ""holiday"" areas in.Try to avoid touching the gilded surface too much at this point, since your fingerprints can leave permanent marks on the surface of unvarnished copper leaf.

, Surfaces gilded with copper leaf will tarnish easily and quickly. A protective sealer needs to be applied to protect from oxidation. Apply one coat of oil-based varnish or specially formulated acrylic topcoat with a paint brush. Allow the sealant to dry completely before handling your project.


See the instructions provided with your varnish product for more information about curing times.
You can obtain varnish or topcoat from most home improvement and craft stores. It also comes in spray formulas."

Gently wash your skin.",How to Attach Sequins with Glue," Decide where you want to position the sequins on the clothing or fabric. Take tailor's chalk or an invisible fabric marker and make light dots where you'd like to put the individual sequins. Invisible fabric markers will wash off in the laundry, can be dry cleaned, or can be rubbed off easily.


Make sure you think about what sort of design you'd like before you draw over the fabric.
Lightly press the tailor's chalk onto the fabric so that you don't break the edge for future projects.;
, If you're using a hot glue gun, place a small dab of glue to the back of the sequin. You should use hot glue if you're planning on washing the material and wearing it often. Hot glue may also do better at preventing the sequins from popping off later. Take care not to burn yourself or place glue on the fabric itself. You could also use fabric or tacky glue if you want to apply jewels to a project that won't be handled roughly or washed.Avoid using white school glue since it becomes brittle when it dries. This can cause the sequins to pop off.
Flat sequins don't have a designated front and back, although cupped sequins should be glued on the flat side. This will allow it to catch and reflect more light.If you find it hard to glue sequins with your fingers (for example, your fingers feel a little too sticky), use a toothpick, pencil, or tweezers to lift and place the sequins., Line up the sequin on the mark that you made and gently press it into place so that the glue doesn't squeeze out the sides. place gently. Hold the sequin in place if you're using hot glue. This will help it set. Otherwise, leave the garment or fabric to lay flat until the glue dries.

Most tacky or fabric glues should dry within 15 to 30 seconds.
The glue should be completely hardened before you use or wear the fabric. Let it dry longer if it still feels tacky or sticky.

, Continue to glue down all of your sequins and make sure they're in the same direction if you're using cupped sequins. Run your hands gently over the sequins to get them to shine in one direction.Although you may think it's easier to apply all the glue at once and then place the sequins on the glue dots, your glue might dry before you get the sequins down. Start out by just doing 6 sequins at a time until you get faster.
Be gentle when rubbing the sequins since they can fall off. If some do fall off, you might want to consider reattaching them with a stronger glue.

, Be aware that the glue won't be as durable as stitched-on sequins. But, it should still hold well for quite a few wears, especially if you care for the item. Be gentle when moving and try not to rub up or brush against things.


Keep a small bottle of craft glue in your bag or purse to touch up any sequins that may fall off. This way, you can quickly glue them back on.

, Use a rule to see how long your strip of sequins is. If you need a specific length, draw the placement onto the garment or fabric using tailor's chalk or an invisible marker. If you want to make a design from the sequin strip, draw it onto the fabric first. This will help you in position the strip accurately when you glue it down.


Try to have extra length of sequin strip. This way, you can make sure you won't run out and need to add a second strip which could discontinue the design and look unprofessional. You can always trim away excess sequin strip when you're done.

, Take a sharp pair of fabric scissors and trim the ends of the strips. Take care not to cut yourself. Fabric scissors will keep you from bending the sequins out of shape.Keep your fingers near the end of the cut strip so that sequins don't fall off.

If you ever need half a sequin, use sharp scissors to make a clean cut down the middle. Blunt scissors will bend the sequin rather than cut it.

, This can be useful to do if you're adding a strip that winds its way around a garment, such as a leotard or a dress. After you pin the strip down, you can glue it down in sections, flattening down as you go and removing pins.


When joining strips, be sure to carefully align the ends so that they appear to keep running in a single strip.

, Using the hot glue gun, run a short line of glue along the back of the sequin strip. Work in small amounts so that it doesn't dry before you can place the sequin strip down. Working in small amounts also gives you more flexibility to move your sequins around.


To keep the strip from sliding, hold the ends in place for about 10 seconds or so before letting go.
You may also choose to dab the fabric itself, running the glue across the place you’d like to attach the sequin strip.

, Use your fingers or tweezers to hold and work with the strip. Carefully press down on the line or design you've made on the garment or fabric. Press the sequin strip in place for about 15 seconds to give it a chance to set.


If glue oozes out from the center, let it dry and use it as a rivet to keep the sequins in place.Wait until all the glue dries before you wear or use the garment or fabric.

, The glue should be entirely dry within 15 to 30 seconds. Test to see if it's entirely dry before you add any more sequin strips.


To test for dryness, gently pat tweezers, pencil, or your fingers near the glued fabrics. If the glue is still sticky, give it more time to set.

, To attach sequins to your skin, you'll need glue that isn't toxic or hot (since it can damage your skin). Consider using eyelash, bindi or acrylic adhesive (spirit gum). Avoid using eyelash or latex if you plan on being around water or you tend to sweat a lot. If you need the sequins to set quickly, you may want to use latex glue although you should only use it in small amounts. Spirit glue is very sticky and you'll need spirit gum remover to take off the sequins and adhesive.You can find eyelash glue at drugstores and latex glue or spirit glue at beauty supply stores.

, Wash and dry the area of skin where you'll be sticking sequins or rhinestones. Avoid areas with hair, or be sure to shave or wax first. If your skin can tolerate it, rubbing alcohol will do a great job of cleaning off dirt and oils from your skin.The cleaner and less oily your skin is, the better the sequins will stick.


Test the glue in a small area of your skin before applying the sequins. Make sure that your skin doesn't negatively react to the glue. If you notice redness, swelling, or irritation, don't use the glue.
Be sure not to get any rubbing alcohol or soap in your eyes.

, Place just enough glue so that the sequin will stay in place. If you put too much, the sequin may ooze glue and take too long to dry. When you apply sequins to your skin, make sure that the cupped part of the sequin is hugging your skin.This will help the sequin stay on better and have a greater surface area to glue.


Use a small makeup or flat eye shadow brush to dab the glue onto the sequin or your skin., Pick up the sequin that has glue on it using your fingers or tweezers. Press it in place gently on the skin and hold it there for 10 seconds before moving on to the next sequin. Check to see if the glue has completely dried by gently patting the sequins to see if they move.


Be gentle when touching the glued on sequins. Rough movement can cause the sequins to fall off. If a sequin falls out of place, remove the sequin and reattach it with your glue.Keep some extra glue in your bag or purse to reattach sequins at your event.
If you're trying to make a row of sequins stick on your face, it can be helpful to use a mirror to ensure you're keeping the row even.

, Use warm water and soap to remove the sequins. Take a wet washcloth and gently rub so that you remove both the sequins and glue. Add some soap to help ease the sequin away from the skin.


Follow any manufacturer's instructions for removing the specific adhesive you used.
If you're having trouble, use rubbing alcohol to help remove the sequins and dissolve the glue.

Clean the lampshade if needed.,
Design the decorations to be added.,
Measure the lampshade.,
Draw or find the designs to serve as templates.,
Make the foam design pieces.,
Attach the foam design pieces to the lampshade.,
Continue adding design pieces until the design is complete.

,
Decide whether you'll add other decorative elements than the foam pieces.,
Finished.",How to Decorate a Lampshade with Foam Shapes," Allow to dry fully before proceeding.;
, Here, anything goes. Bear in mind that whatever designs you choose must be easy to draw and cut out from the foam and may need to match the color of the foam sheet you can get hold of. Simpler designs work best. Some ideas include:


Rows of cars, buses, trucks, boats, etc., driving around the lampshade.
An ocean with fish, sharks, whales, dolphins, octopuses, etc. swimming around the lampshade.
A flower garden filled with all sorts or only one sort of flower, such as daisies, tulips, trailing ivy, etc. Use flower and plant designs that are simple to draw and work out.
A zoo filled with animals you or your child likes.
Favorite clothes, such as dresses or shoes; or perhaps accessories and makeup, such as tubes of lipstick, high heels and handbags.
Geometric shapes - all of the same sort but differing sizes, or many different shapes.
The night sky, with lots of stars and a moon.
And so forth...

, This will determine how many design pieces in the sizes you're using will fit around the lampshade.

, There are key considerations here: the design pieces must be sized to fit well on the lampshade and the design pieces should all complement each other. It can help to draw the idea on paper first, then source the designs after you're satisfied with the total design.


Draw the designs on light cardboard. Cut out the shapes in readiness for making the foam pieces.
Decide what color foam to use for each design element. Light plain colors or white can be decorated using suitable paint or gluing on decorations, if wished.

,


Place the cardboard templates over the selected foam sheet.
Using a thin-tipped marker or pencil, carefully draw around the shape to transfer the design to the foam.
Using scissors or a sharp craft knife, cut out the drawn-on shapes, making as many as you'll need to make the lampshade design.
If you need to add eyes, handles, etc., do this now. Hole punches are good ways to make eyes or holes for threading through ribbon, etc.

,


Attach a small piece of double-sided adhesive pads or tape to the back of each design piece.
Peel off the backing paper from the outer side of the tape.
Following the design you've already decided on, stick each piece onto the lampshade.

,, For example, you might want to add things like ribbon bows, artificial flowers, beads, buttons, sequins, etc. Children might like to add an image of themselves or a small something that they have hand drawn. You can cover such an item on adhesive plastic before attaching it, to keep it clean.

, Attach the lampshade to its base and place on display.

Put up a little shelving.",How to Decorate a Dorm Room," Posters or other forms of wall art are a fun and popular way to decorate your dorm room. Add some of your favorite band posters, or posters with images of landscapes, art print reproductions, or appealing abstract designs.Most large universities will have a week-long poster sale near the beginning of the fall semester. You can easily find popular dorm-room posters at this sale.;
, If you have pictures of people who are important to you (including friends, family, and a significant other), you can frame these and hang them around your dorm room. It’s common for students to frame several pictures (between 5 and 10) and hang them together on the same section of wall as a photograph montage.


Students also often hang unframed photographs along a hung strand of Christmas lights.If you’re worried about being homesick at college, pictures of loved ones are a good way to feel connected.
You can find picture frames at any nearby craft or hobby store.

, If you’re unhappy with the color of your dorm room walls, ask your RA or university housing manager if you are permitted to paint the walls. Although most schools will not allow this, some may give you permission. This will give you an opportunity to brighten up the color of your dorm room, and set it apart from the unpainted rooms of most university housing.

, If you’re sharing your bedroom with another individual, you’ll need to find a way to share decorations and wall space. Your roommate will doubtlessly have their own decoration ideas, and you need to give them their own space to decorate. For example, if your beds are on different sides of the room, each of you could decorate the half of the dorm that contains your own bed.


Communication is key: if you cover the entire dormitory in posters and pictures and leave no room for your roommate’s decorations, they’ll likely object to the arrangement.

, Small potted plants will add a natural look to your dorm room. They take up little space, and are simple to care for.If you anticipate having little time to care for and water plants, look into purchasing succulents (including cacti). These plants are easy to care for, require little water, and can thrive in most kinds of light.


Look for small potted plants at a local plant nursery or gardening center.

, This is a practical decoration as well as an aesthetic one. If you plan to do much homework in your room, you’ll need a lamp to help you see by. Add a small lamp on your desk, or invest in a larger floor-lamp to provide light for the whole dorm room.Lamps come in many different styles and shapes. Look for lamps to purchase at a nearby furniture store, office-supply store, or general retail store like Target or WalMart.

, If you’re short on space in your dorm but would still like to have seating to entertain friends, consider adding a beanbag chair. You can also find large-sized floor cushions, which take up less room than the beanbag chairs but still provide seating space.You may be able to find floor cushions or beanbag chairs at your university bookstore.
If you have a cohesive color theme to your dorm, colored beanbag chairs or floor cushions can help reinforce the colors.

, In order to make your dorm room feel more like a small home and less like a large closet, you can lay a rug down. Place the rug either in front of your door or else in the middle of the dorm floor. A large, colorful rug will draw the eye of any visitors. You can also complement the room’s overall color scheme with this rug.If you’re planning to decorate your dorm room frugally, you can find online instructions for various ways to make your own rug.

, Pick up bedding supplies in a color or pattern that will complement the general color theme of your dorm room. In order to be well prepared for a year in a dorm, plan to purchase: one or two quilts or comforters, one or two comfortable sleeping pillows, a handful of decorative pillows (if desired), a sheet set (containing pillow cases, a top sheet, and a fitted sheet), and a zippered mattress protector.Before you begin shopping for dorm bedding, make sure that you confirm the bed size and length with the housing department. Most dorm beds are twin sized, and either standard or extra long.

, In addition to taking up floor space and serving as a practical decoration, as desk will give you room to study and provide space to put your books and other personal possessions. You can purchase a desk and bring it with you to your university. Alternately, your university may provide you with a standard wooden desk.


This is another opportunity to communicate and cooperate with your roommate: you’ll both need to decide whose desk will be placed where.

, Storage space can be tight in a dorm, and added shelving will give you space to store small items like textbooks, school supplies, and candles. You’ll also be able to display small decorations on shelves: plants, standing framed pictures, decorative lamps, and other personal effects.


If you’d rather add storage space in a less invasive way, shop for a hanging shoe holder (which will fit neatly in a closet) and a hanging basket to hold your shower and bathroom supplies."

Stand to the side of the street.,
Look for a cab that's unoccupied.,
Step off the curb.,
Stick out your arm.,
Make eye contact with the driver.,
Talk to the driver after they pull over.",How to Hail a Cab1," Stand on the side where traffic is moving in the direction you want to go. Stay on the curb and never put yourself in the path of oncoming cars.


Stand in a spot with good visibility, like at a street corner. The easier it is for a cab driver to see you, the better your chances are of getting a ride.;
, Many cities have cabs with lights or signs that indicate if they’re in service or not. Look for a cab with a lit-up sign on the roof -- that usually means it’s open and unoccupied.If you’re having a hard time figuring out which cabs are taken and which are available, ask a local for help. If there’s no one around you, try looking it up online using your phone. Go to the official website for the city you’re in and look for tips on hailing a cab.

, Once you've spotted an available cab, step off the curb to make yourself more visible. Don't step out too far into the street, and make sure you look out for oncoming traffic., Be firm and confident so the cab driver knows you want to be picked up. Raise your arm up high to make it more visible to the driver.

, Look at them and smile so they know you’re interested in a ride. A cab driver that feels confident you need a ride is more likely to pull over., Politely tell the driver the address of your destination and then get in the backseat. If you’re hailing a cab in a busy area with lots of traffic, hop in the backseat of the cab before you tell your driver your destination so cars aren’t lining up behind you.

"
"
Find a cab stand near you.,
Wait in line.,
Get in a cab when it's your turn.",How to Hail a Cab2," Cab stands are locations where cab drivers line up to wait for passengers. They’re usually located in high-traffic areas where drivers know they’ll get a lot of rides.If you’re trying to hail a cab at an airport, look for a cab stand outside the entrance/exit to your terminal.
If you’re visiting a popular tourist destination or there’s one nearby, look around for a cab stand. They’re often located in areas where there are a lot of tourists.Ask the front desk at your hotel if there’s a cab stand outside. Cabs will often line up outside hotels and wait for guests who need a ride., Don’t cut in front of other people or try to take their cab when it pulls up. Cab stands are first come, first served, so be patient and wait your turn.

, Give the driver the address to your destination and make sure you have cash to pay the fare and tip. Ask your driver about cab stands near your destination to save yourself the hassle of finding a cab later on.

Download a cab-hailing app.,
Share your location.,
Enter your payment information.,
Order a cab.,
Keep your phone nearby while you wait.,
Make yourself visible so your driver can see you.",How to Hail a Cab3," Look up which apps, if any, are available in your location. Be aware that most cab-hailing apps are city-specific, so you’ll need to do your research beforehand to find an app you can use. Download the app on your smartphone so you can easily access it when you’re ready to order a ride., Go into your phone settings and make sure location-sharing is turned on. Consent to sharing your location with the cab-hailing app if your phone asks for permission. This will make it easier for your driver to find you, and it allows you to order a cab from virtually any location., A lot of cab-hailing apps allow you to pay with a credit card through the app itself. You might be able to tip your driver through the app as well, making apps a great option if you don’t like to carry around cash., Once your location and payment information is updated, order a ride through the app. Keep in mind that there may be a delay between when you order your ride and when your driver shows up, so plan accordingly. Make sure you’re at the location you ordered your cab to at the scheduled pickup time., Answer the phone if your driver calls. They might be having trouble finding you or have a question about your location., They might cancel your order if they can’t find you, so look out for their cab and flag them down when they arrive."
"
Find a local cab company.,
Call and order a cab.,
Wait until your cab arrives.",How to Hail a Cab4," Search online or call the local information hotline if you’re not sure what cab companies are near you. Most cab companies are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, but double check before you call., Give them your address and ask how long it will be until your driver arrives. If you’re in a busy area, ask what the company’s cabs look like so you can spot your driver quickly., You may have to wait longer when ordering a cab over the phone. If you have a long wait, hang out inside your hotel room or go to a nearby cafe to pass the time. Make sure your phone’s on in case your driver tries to call you.

Go outside 10-15 minutes before your scheduled pickup time in case your driver is early.

Locate a taxi rank.,
Wait for a taxi to approach.,
Ensure the taxi is licensed.,
Take the taxi to your destination.

",How to Hail a Cab in Paris," Taxi ranks are located at most major intersections throughout the city, consisting of tented areas and street corners with a ""Taxi"" sign prominently displayed. You can find one using maps, phone and computer applications, and by asking locals.;
, You need to stand in line in the rank area and wait your turn for a taxi. If you are within 50 m (164 feet) of a rank (but not at the rank itself), taxis won't stop for you. If you are outside of a rank's designated 50 m (164 feet) range, you can freely hail a cab.

, It's important to ride only in licensed taxis, as you'll have no legal recourse if cheated by an unlicensed taxi driver. Taxis in Paris come in numerous colors and car types, but you can tell if a taxi is licensed by looking for these things:


A ""Taxi Parisien"" sign on the roof
A working fare meter
A taxi license plate on the front right wing of the vehicle
A display on the back of the taxi that monitors its daily usage

Avoid rush hour if possible.,
Avoid game-day travel.,
Travel light.,
Plan your route.,
Find the station.,
Purchase correct fare.,
Pass through the turnstile.,
Proceed to the nearest escalator that coordinates with the track line going in the direction of the subway train going towards the station you intend to get off on.,
Choose a platform.,
Board the train.,
Exit the train when it comes to a complete stop at your destination.,
Exit the station.,
Add fare to card.",How to Ride the Washington D.C. Metro," The trains can get pretty crowded between 7:00 am and 9:00 am or 4:00 pm and 7:00 pm on weekdays. Discounts are available if you ride between 9:30 AM and 3:00 PM.;
, There are seven professional sports teams that fans get to via Metro. Avoid using Metro when a game is about to happen. Since there are football (Redskins), basketball (Wizards and Mystics), baseball (Nationals), hockey (Capitals), and soccer teams (United and Freedom), plus Hoya games at the Verizon Center, the Metro can get crowded on game-days.

, You are allowed to bring your bicycle on Metro during non-rush hour, and many people travel the trains with suitcases from the airport or the Amtrak station, but be very careful not to overburden yourself. You are going to have to negotiate staircases, escalators and automatic doors with your bags. If you think you have more than you can carry nimbly by yourself, you should consider calling a taxi instead.

, You can check the trip planner online, ask your hotel concierge for information on which station is closest to your destination or study the maps in the station. Once you jump on a train it's a lot harder to figure it out.

, Metro stations are marked with brown square poles with an “M”. this same symbol is used on most neighborhood and tourist maps.

, Look at the chart above the fare machines to find your destination and determine how much your trip will cost. Make sure to purchase round-trip fare. Five dollars per day is a good rule of thumb to start with. You will need a separate fare card for each person in your party. Be advised: the machines will only return a maximum of $5.00 in change, and it will be in quarters.

, Locate a fare gate with a green and white arrow, not a red dash. Insert your farecard face up with the arrow pointed towards the feed located on the side of the gate. Remove your card from the slot on top of the fare gate to open the styles. Put your ticket in a convenient place. You will need to use it to exit once you reach your destination. Refrain from keeping it near cell phones as fare cards have been known to demagnetize!

, While some stations (especially inside of DC) have escalators after the station attendant going towards the subways, if you don't encounter one before the station attendant you might very well encounter one shortly after the attendant. Observe escalator etiquette. Stand on the right to allow commuters to pass on the left. Stand facing forward and hold the handrail as the escalator moves downwards to the escalator exit.The escalators are usually moving pretty fast. If you can't keep up, move over. Stay as far to the right as possible so others can get by easily.


Although the general written rule on WMATA's website is to not continue walking down or up the escalator, there are generally signs near the elevator or even some stations that have a verb communication that says that you can walk to get to the station escalator exit faster to get on your subway train faster. Be careful to ensure that there is communication going to ensure this can be safely executed.
Two of the WMATA escalators are record holders of deepest escalators in the Washington Metro system including Rosslyn (Rosslyn/Arlington, VA on the blue and orange lines) and Wheaton (Wheaton, MD on the red line). Be careful when riding these escalators as you can feel faint or light-headed when going down to such a deep level. Wheaton is the deepest escalator on the eastern seaboard and definitely the deepest escalator in the WMATA system.
Try not to lean on the sideboard of the escalator as it moves. Not only can this cause a burn pattern on your leg, but can also lead to other signs of injuries.

, You may need to study the signs to make sure you are on the right platform. Some stations have two platforms, one for each direction, whereas others have one from which you can access both directions. There are six lines (red, blue, yellow, orange, green and silver). They each go in two directions named for the last stop on the line. Many commuters tend to wait for the train in the middle of the platform, so they can exit most quickly when the train arrives at their final destination. You can usually get a better seat on the train if you walk to the end of the platform where the crowd is thinner. Either way, clear the space at the bottom of the escalator or passing travelers will likely bump you. Stand behind the bumpy titles along the edge of the platform. Watch for circular flashing lights on the edge of the platform, for this indicates a train is approaching.

, Do not approach the train until it comes to a stop. When the door opens, allow passengers to exit before boarding the train. Move to the center of the car and sit down if you can. It is still good manners to give your seat for people with disabilities, women who are pregnant, children, and the elderly. Listen for the chimes that indicate the doors are closing. Do not block the doors! The doors are not like elevator doors. They do not reopen automatically.

, You may note some riders approaching the door just before the train stops. You may also note some such riders losing their balance and falling into people. The train does not stay in the station long, but you will have enough time to exit even if you wait until the train stops. Exit quickly and move away from the train so that others can board.

, Follow signs to exit the station. Ride the escalator and insert your ticket in the turnstile just as you did when you entered the station. The turnstile will print a new value on your fare ticket, so you will know how much your trip cost, and how much money is left on your card.

, If you miscalculate and don't have enough fare on your card for the trip you just took, the turnstile will not let you pass, step away from the turnstile so others can get through. Turn around and find the exit fare machine. Farecards are reusable. If you have money left over on your farecard you can save it for your next trip, or keep it as a souvenir.

Know the fastest route.,
Research taxi customs and regulations prior to traveling.,
Know the going rate.",How to Avoid Common Taxi Scams when Traveling1," It is always smart to have a general idea of where you are going and what the fastest route should be before entering a taxi. Some taxi drivers will scam tourists by taking them on longer ""scenic"" routes in order to run up the meter, making the trip more expensive.When you enter the taxi say “you are going to take X highway to the hotel right?” This will signal to the driver that you know your way around and will help to avoid a potential scam.
Despite your best research, depending on the time of day and traffic, there may be faster alternate routes. Some cabs will take a longer distance route to avoid getting stuck in rush hour traffic.;
, In some countries tipping a taxi driver is not customary, in other areas taxis will add on charges for baggage, additional passengers, or rush hour service. You should always do some research prior to your trip in order to get a general idea of common taxi customs and regulations. This will allow you to know what to expect and it will be easier to spot a scam.For instance, if a taxi tries to charge you for extra baggage, but that is not customary to the area then it is likely a scam.

, It is always best to have the cab driver use the meter and pay the price that shows up on the meter. That being said some drivers can scam you by charging the busy evening or weekend rate during the day. Some drivers may claim the meter is broken and try to charge you an excessive rate. As a result it is a good idea to know the going rate in advance.For example, you can ask your concierge for the standard rate from the hotel to the airport. This will help you to avoid being overcharged.
For some cities you can look up fares and prices for common taxi routes online using the website www.taxifarefinder.com.
Before getting into a cab, ask the driver how much the fare should be. They will not be able to give you an exact amount due to potential traffic, but they can likely give you a general idea of the rate.

Use a taxi stand if possible.,
Always take well marked cabs.,
Ask your concierge to book you a taxi.,
Carry the phone number of a reputable taxi company.",How to Avoid Common Taxi Scams when Traveling2," Another way to avoid taxi scams is by using a taxi stand whenever possible. In many cases people will flag down taxis and hop in. This can be convenient, however, it can also raise your chances of taking an unmarked or unlicensed taxi. In many cities taxi stands will be clearly marked on maps and are easy to find throughout the city.Always use a taxi stand at the airport. Many unlicensed drivers will pick up unsuspecting tourists.

, Some people will get scammed by taking an unmarked or unlicensed taxi. These cars will often advertise cheaper rates that may seem appealing to a traveler on a budget. This is typically because unlicensed taxis do not need to follow industry regulations and many of them can be complete scams. As a result, you should always take well marked taxis while traveling.The cab should have a visible taxi-company logo and telephone number on the outside of the vehicle.
Avoid unmarked cabs with makeshift taxi lights on top.

, To ensure that you are taking a legitimate taxi with a licensed driver, you can always ask your hotel concierge to call or book you a taxi. This prevents you from having to flag down a cab and the hotel will most likely use a reputable company. Most scams happen when using unmarked or unlicensed taxis., In order to make sure that you always take licensed cabs, you can write down the telephone number of a major taxi company. Ask your concierge to give you the number prior to leaving the hotel for the first time. This way if you need to take a taxi at any point during your travels, you can always call and order a cab from a local reputable company.


You should also write down the address and telephone number of your hotel. This will help you communicate the address to taxi drivers even if you don't speak the same language.

Make sure the taxi meter is working.,
Pay for the cab in small bills.,
Don’t pay until after all your belongings have been unloaded.,
Write down the driver's name and license plate number.",How to Avoid Common Taxi Scams when Traveling3," One common taxi scam occurs when the driver pretends that the meter is not working and attempts to charge an extremely high price. In order to avoid this scam, you should discuss the rate with the taxi driver ahead of time and ask the driver about the meter prior to departing.If your driver refuses to use the meter or tries to say that it is cheaper without the meter, do not get in the cab and find a different taxi.

, Some taxi scams involve giving incorrect change, switching bills, or shortchanging customers. As a result, you should always pay for cabs with small bills. Also, when you give the driver money, count out loud the amount you are giving them. This will help prevent the driver from switching out a $50 bill for a $20 bill.For example, if the taxi ride cost $12 you can say “Here is a $20 bill, can I get $5 back?”

, Although rare, some drivers have been known to drive away with your luggage or personal belongings in the cab. As a result you should never pay the fare until after all your belongings have been unloaded from the vehicle.

, It is a good idea to always write down the name and license number of the taxi you are taking. This way if you ever feel threatened, lose an item, or get scammed you can report the driver and vehicle to the taxi company.


If you ever feel unsafe or uncomfortable while taking a taxi, ask the driver to stop the car and exit the vehicle as soon as possible."

Arrange for a shuttle to pick you up from the airport.,
Take public transit.,
Try Uber.,
Rent a car.",How to Avoid Common Taxi Scams when Traveling4," A lot of taxi scams take place at airports, when travelers are tired and most susceptible to getting ripped off. If you are traveling to a foreign country for the first time and are not familiar with the language or customs, you may want to arrange for a shuttle or other service to pick you up from the airport.This can often be arranged through your hotel, and some hotels will even have a complimentary airport shuttle service.

, If you are nervous about taxi scams while traveling, you can avoid them altogether by using other modes of transportation. Many large cities will have excellent and affordable public transportation systems. Although at time less convenient, traveling on public transit can be a reasonable way to get around a city or country while traveling.You will also get an opportunity to interact with locals and see what it is really like living in this part of the world.

, Another way to avoid taxi scams, is by using Uber while traveling. Uber allows you to order a driver using an app on your phone. It will send you the name and a picture of your driver as well as the type of vehicle and license plate number. This way, if you have any difficulties with the ride, you can report the driver to the local authorities. Uber also pays in advance with your credit card so you do not need to worry about getting scammed for extra charges. Uber is available in major cities across the globe and is a great tool to use while traveling abroad.You will need to have a wifi connection to order a car and track the driver. Most airports will have free wifi, but this may be more difficult to find when you are out and about.

, For some vacations, it may make sense to rent a car instead of relying on taxis or public transit. Although this can be more expensive, it will give you the freedom to travel at your own pace. You can also easily travel between cities or take longer trips that would be too expensive in a taxi.


Make sure that you are familiar with local driving customs prior to travel.
Check to see that your driver's license is legal in the country you are traveling to.

Plan your trip.,
Pay your fare.,
Find your way.,
Board your train.,
Follow the signs, if you are transferring.",How to Use the CTA Rail System," Each of CTA's lines operate frequent service through most of the day, every day (with a couple of exceptions). To find your way: Simply determine where you may enter the system, where you need to go, and follow the most direct, colored route on the map. Trains are designated by line color and its final destination (i.e., Blue Line train to O'Hare, Brown Line train to Kimball, Pink Line train to the Loop).
If you have to transfer from one line to another, do so at a designated transfer station--it's free!


You can also use CTA's website or the RTA Tripsweb to help you plan your trip.;
, Fares on the 'L' are paid with electronic farecards. You can buy or refill a Transit Card at any 'L' station's main entry. To enter, simply insert your card into the slot on the turnstile, remove it when it's given back to you, and walk through when the green ""ENTER"" light goes on. Chicago Card and Chicago Card Plus holders only need to wave their card past the circle on the front of the turnstile as they enter.


Be aware that the CTA will soon be replacing the magnetic stripe cards you insert into a slot with Ventra cards, which are read via NFC. Simply touch your card to the large plastic square with ""Ventra"" printed on it and hold it in place until the light goes green and a tone plays.

, Follow signs directing you to trains heading in the direction you wish to go. For example, if you are downtown and need to go north on the Red Line, follow signs to trains going to ""Howard"" (the northern terminal of the Red Line).

, Trains will show their destination on the front and sides of the train (center window). At transfer points, the recorded announcements also announce what kind of train it is audibly (""This is a Red Line train to Howard"").

, At designated transfer points, you may transfer for free between trains. Simply follow signs on platforms to the line and train destination you need. If you must exit the system and walk to a nearby station as part of a transfer, no money will be deducted from your farecard when you use it to re-enter (the system recognizes you as a free transferee).

Know what to look for in terms of lights.,
Step out when you see a cab coming in your direction with only the central lights on.,
See whether you can get a short ride.,
Wait for another cab.,
Enjoy that giddy feeling.",How to Hail a Cab in New York," A taxi in NYC has three basic light signs on the roof of the car:


If only the numbers in the middle are lit, then that cab is waiting for you to flag it down.
If only the outer lights are lit, then that cab is off-duty and headed back to the depot for a shift change, but it may still be possible to get a short ride.
If there are no lights lit on top, then the driver already has a fare inside, but you won't need to wait long for another to come by.;
, Do as the natives and simply step out onto the road. In most NYC streets, and every avenue you get a car's width of space between the curb and the flow of traffic, so don't worry about being splattered all over.


Step out as far as you can, so that you can be clearly seen but not so far that you put yourself at risk from oncoming traffic.
Put out your arm with your hand out flat (sort of like a horizontal high-five). That's all you need to do, the driver will pull into the nearest open space among the parked cars beside you or even slow long enough for you to jump in if the traffic is not too heavy.

, If the outer lights are lit then the cab is off duty as mentioned earlier, but if you are only going a short distance (roughly within 10 blocks, which equals half a mile) and the driver is going in that direction he or she may pick you up for the chance of a few extra bucks at the end of his or her shift. To signal this:


Simply repeat the process of hailing a cab but bend your elbow slightly and give a 'thumbs-up' rather than an outstretched palm. This signals what the natives term a 'short stop' and the driver will decide whether to stop or not.
If they drive past you, don't start yelling and flipping them off like they do on T.V., it's not going to make them stop and if by chance they do, well it's not to take you as a fare.

, When there are no lights, this means no cab for you. This one is already taken. But don't fret, there are thousands driving around at any given time and most likely you'll only have to wait mere seconds for another one to come by.

, Once you've taken your first cab ride in the big city, it will stay with you for a while, and make sure to brag to everyone you know back home!

Some lines intersect with each other in the Boston metropolis or major station depots (such as the North and South Stations) and then weave out to different parts of the city.
In addition, there are commuter rails that run in & out of Boston, as well as many bus lines run around other cities that connect with subway lines.
The green line separates into four different directions outside of metro Boston towards the west (B, C, D, and E). The B line goes to Boston College in Brighton, the C line goes to Cleveland Circle in Brighton, the D line goes to Riverside in Newton, and the E goes to Heath Street in Boston.;
, It may be easy to tell at some stations and difficult at others. Inbound usually means ""towards Boston"" or when you're heading into metro Boston, while outbound means ""getting out of metro Boston"". Inbound and outbound station street level accesses are normally found either across the street or around the corner from each other.

An easy example would be if you were coming from Fenway to North Station. You would simply take the Green Line Inbound because you're going into the city.
A difficult example would be if you were coming from Harvard to the Airport Station. You'll need to take the Red Line Inbound from Harvard Station to Park Station, Green Line Inbound to Government Center Station, and Blue Line Outbound to Airport Station. There is also taking the Red Line Inbound to Downtown Crossing Station, connect to the Orange Line Inbound to State Station, and Blue Line Outbound to Airport Station.
It is also possible for the two to switch while still travelling in the same direction. For example, you can be going inbound on the Red Line towards Park Street and Downtown Crossing. But once you pass the downtown stations, you are now going outbound.

, Some ticket machines only accept debit and credit cards instead of cash. When you get to a machine, press the ""Bus/Subway"" option. You will then be asked a few questions, such as how many tickets you wish to purchase. Use the correct method of payment and wait for your ticket to be printed. You also have an option of getting a receipt., If you have a pre-paid Charlie Card, place it on the front of card reader machine & wait for the light to change. Wait for the doors to open and walk to the appropriate subway line. Be cautious for ""piggy-backers"", whom are people that attempt to go through the doors literally right behind you before they close again without paying.

, Wait for the subway to come to a complete stop. Allow people to exit the train before entering., Do not just stand in the doorway when you enter, as there may be others behind you.

, Trains will notify passengers on the upcoming stops, whether it's by automated machine or the conductor over the intercom., Some street level exits are only stairs, escalators, or elevators, while others are a combination of any three.

If you're confused on where the street level exit is, just follow the roof signs concerning the street level or basically just follow the majority of the crowd.

BART trains are more likely to be a little late than a little early.,If you are boarding the station at a time when trains are crowded, and wish to use the front or rear car to maximize the chances of seating space, budget an extra minute to walk to the end of the platform.,
Check BART's Quick Planner to get their estimates of the crowdedness of trains.,
If you are really interested in getting seating space and don't mind your commute being longer (for instance, if you'd like to sit and work on your laptop), and your direction of travel is crowded, consider riding in the opposite direction and then boarding a less crowded train in the direction you're going.,
A scheduled transfer is a transfer between trains where both trains arrive at about the same time at a station, but the train being transferred to will not wait for the other train if it is delayed.,
Occasionally, the BART system encounters delays due to reasons ranging from medical emergencies on trains, equipment issues on trains and tracks, and police activity at stations.",How to Ride Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)," There are five lines, referred to by their end points (not by their colors).

Richmond <> Daly City - Millbrae: The line terminates at Millbrae on weeknights before 8 PM. At all other times except Sundays, this line terminates at Daly City. This line does not run on Sunday.
Warm Springs or Fremont <> Richmond: The line runs to Warm Springs on evenings and weekends, and to Fremont on weekdays before the evening)
Warm Springs or Fremont <> Daly City: The line runs to Warm Springs on weekdays before the evening, and to Fremont on Saturday; it does not run in the evenings or on Sundays
Pittsburg / Bay Point <> SFO: When the Richmond - Millbrae line is not running (i.e., on evenings and weekends), this line also goes to Millbrae
Dublin / Pleasanton <> Daly City;
, You can use BART's ""Find Closest Station"" feature.Then check the schedule (keep in mind that the schedule differs for weekdays and weekends).Decide when you wish to arrive at your destination and work back from that.


The BART schedule is very complex. Some lines change destinations based on time. All lines have variable schedules based on day and time. If you are unfamiliar with the BART schedule, check online first. Once you enter the station, there are station maps within the station that you can access.

, BART determines fares based on the point of entry and exit, and one-way fares range from $1.95 (for stations that are within 6 miles of one another) to $15.70 (between the San Francisco International Airport and the Oakland International Airport). You can use the fare calculator on the BART website.(note that the image accompanying this is a fare chart from 2014, and does not include the Oakland International Airport)., When using these services, you may need to select the public transit option, and you may be shown options other than BART. Google Maps also includes a fare when it shows routes. You may also use the Google Maps Schedule Explorer to get a clearer idea of additional options and their timings.


, You may use your mapping tool to guide yourself toward the station. Look for the BART logo (a prominent ba, similar to the favicon on the BART website) to identify the station. In the case of underground stations, look for staircases or escalators leading down.

If you will park a car at the BART station, be aware that parking at some locations fills up very early on weekdays. Also, some stations charge a nominal fee to park. Reserved parking, daily parking, and long-term airport parking permits are available for purchase. Note that not all stations have parking. In the BART system map, stations that have parking are designated with a P., Ticket machines at each station take cash and change as well as credit and debit cards. Many retail locations near BART lines also sell tickets.

Tickets are sold according to how much money you put on them. You can add fare to a ticket while you are inside the BART system.
Check to see if you are eligible for any of the discounts. Students, seniors, and ""persons with disabilities, Medicare cardholders and children 5 to 12 years old"" are eligible.
You can put enough money on one ticket for multiple rides and use it several times.
BART charges your ticket based only on where you enter the system and where you exit the system, so there is no charge for changing trains. You need to use your ticket or card at both entry and exit.
When making a roundtrip, if you know exactly how much you will spend on the roundtrip, add enough fare for the roundtrip when buying the ticket. This will reduce your time spent waiting in line on the return journey.
If you are a one-time BART user and are not sure what your exact fare should be, it is better to underpay initially and use the Add Fare gate if you have insufficient balance to exit.

, Such announcements are available on BART's websiteand will also be displayed at the station. This is particularly important if it is very critical for you to be at your destination by a specific time., Walk through and collect it. Keep your ticket with you, since you will need it to exit BART on the other end.

Walk on the left side of escalators, and stand to the right. Do not bring strollers, bikes, large suitcases, etc on escalators.
Follow the signs and listen carefully to the announcements. Generally, the automated announcements for trains in one direction are made by a male and the automated announcements for trains in the other direction are made by a female.
BART etiquette is to leave a space for passengers exiting the train, and then board.

,

Trains are supposed to stop so that the doors of the train align with the black demarcated areas in the yellow strip adjacent to the tracks on the platform. During crowded hours, people generally form lines in front of the black areas.
Trains vary in length from 3 to 10 cars. Each station can accommodate a ten-car train in each direction, and has twenty designated black demarcated areas where train doors may open (two per car). Trains with an even number of cars stop leaving an equal amount of space at the front and back (so for instance an 8-car train will leave 1 car of space in front and 1 car at the back when it stops). Trains with an odd number of cars leave an additional car's worth of space in the front than in the back (so for instance a 7-car train will leave 2 cars of space in the front and 1 in the back). Downtown San Francisco stations have markers on the walls indicating the beginning and end of the boarding zone for trains of different car lengths, but not all BART stations have these markers. Both the automated voice announcements and the automated displays include the number of cars in the train, so use this information to position yourself within the platform.
A good rule of thumb is that, generally, the middle cars of a train are likely to be the most crowded, because most stations are designed so that the entrance to the platform is in the middle, and most people don't walk over to the ends of the platform. To maximize the chance of getting seating space or comfortable standing space, board the front or rear car of the train. Note, however, that bicycles are not allowed on the front car.

,

Do not stand in the doorway for long, or try to walk through the doors as they are closing. Be particularly careful about rushing bikes through doorways. Jammed doorways can hold up the train for you and your fellow passengers, and also prevent additional trains from arriving at the station.
The seats closest to the doors are for the elderly, pregnant women, and handicapped people. Please yield these seats to those in need of them. If there are other vacant seats, use them so that you won't need to vacate your seat on demand.
Some seats on the train face other seats. These usually have less leg room, so avoid these seats if you care about leg room.
Keep your belongings off the seat next to you and off the aisles. Place them on your lap or under your seat. If you are standing, you have a backpack and the train is reasonably crowded, take off your backpack and place it between or next to your feet, so as to make more space for others.
If standing, do not cluster near the doors if there is space elsewhere within the train. Move to the middle or ends of the car. Do not lean against the doorways. If standing near the doors, keep in mind that doors open on different sides at different stations.

,

Keep in mind that doors open on different sides at different stations. On two-track island platform stations, doors open on the left, whereas on stations with separate platforms for each side, doors open on the right. At timed transfer stations such as MacArthur, 12th Street, and 19th Street, there are island platforms where both trains are traveling in the same direction, so one of them has doors opening on the left and the other has doors opening on the right. Also keep in mind that unlike many other train systems, the direction in which doors will open is not announced by the train operator, so you need to pay attention to the station geography or other people's behavior.
If you are far from the car door, make your way to the door in advance of arriving at the station.
Check for all your personal items before making your way to the door. If you are missing a personal item, take a little time to search for it. You can report lost items to the station agent or recover them from the BART website.
If you miss getting off at your designated station (either because you don't notice it, or it's too crowded, or you are looking for a missing item) stay calm and get off at the next station, then ride a train in the opposite direction. You will not be charged extra for doing so.

, If any fare is left on the ticket, it will be returned to you for further use

Do not exit through an emergency exit, otherwise you might be charged a much larger fee a few hours later as BART does not know where you exited.
Since exits tend to be clustered at the times when trains arrive at the station, you may need to wait in line to exit. Be sure to keep your card or ticket out and ready to use for when it's your turn, so as not to waste other people's time.
Sometimes, fare gates don't work, and say ""See Agent"". Before seeing an agent, try an alternative fare gate. If the alternative fare gate doesn't work either, then see an agent. Do not just leave the station through an emergency exit.
If you see an ""Insufficient value on card"" message at the fare gate, use the AddFare booths inside the station to add value. Note that these booths can only be used to add enough value to exit the station. You need to use the booths outside the paid area of the BART system to add more value.

, Therefore, it does not make sense to arrive at the station several minutes before the scheduled departure time of the train you want to catch. Rather, aim to arrive a very short time before the departure of an earlier train. This will protect you not just against missing your train but also against the train itself getting delayed after you board it. It also minimizes time spent waiting at the station.,, Estimates may not always be reliable but are particularly useful as first approximations if you haven't used BART for those routes at that time of day before. Note that crowdedness is a little less on Fridays than other weekdays, and also a little less in the days before and after major holidays such as Thanksgiving and Christmas, because some people take extended vacations around these times., You will not be charged extra money for this. However, keep in mind that you'll end up spending more time: twice the amount of time between your current station and the less crowded station., A timed transfer is similar, except that the train being transferred to waits for up to five minutes for the other train. When using scheduled or timed transfers, keep in mind that a delay in either train could delay your commute, and therefore budget extra time.

Keep in mind that the number of cars as well as the crowdedness of the train you are transferring to could differ significantly from that of the train you are transferring from. Even if the first train you board is uncrowded, the train you transfer to may be quite crowded. Therefore, board the front or rear car of your first train so that you can more quickly switch to the front or rear car of the train you transfer to.

, If it is very critical for you to be somewhere at a particular time, please aim to take a train that is expected to get you to your location well in advance.

If arriving at a particular time is critical, check before entering the system whether there are any system-wide delays. You can use the BART service advisories and also check for announcements displayed at the station.
If the BART delay occurs when you are already in a downtown San Francisco BART station and need to go to a location in San Francisco, consider using the Metro system (which shares station locations with the four downtown San Francisco stations). You can also consider using Uber, Lyft, or other car-ordering services. Order the service when you exit the train so that it arrives by the time you are out on the street. However, keep in mind that car-ordering services may experience significant surge pricing during system-wide BART delays, so check the surge multiplier before you use them.
Keep in mind that during system delays, stations can get very crowded. This can make them unsafe to navigate. It can also make it harder to get Internet access through your cellphone, because a large number of people stuck in a small geographical area may be trying to use the Internet to while away their time and communicate to their friends and colleagues that that they are stuck, thus clogging the network.

Negotiate if you can.,
Agree on a payment plan.",How to Rent an RV," Come up with a figure you’d ideally like to pay to rent an RV. Do some quick research online or at an RV dealer to get an idea of what some typical rental prices are. You may need more beyond your decided number for deposits or to negotiate. It’s helpful to come up with a maximum number that you absolutely won’t go over.


Write down the number of nights and the approximate number of miles of the trip you plan to take in an RV. RV rentals will often have a per night and/or per mile rate, so it’s helpful to have these numbers on hand to estimate rental prices.;
, There are towable RVs—like travel trailers and camper trailers—that attach to the back of your vehicle, and there are motorized RVs—like type A, B, or C motorhomes—that are self-contained with a driving cab.It’s important to decide on an RV type according to your needs, the number of people you’re traveling with, the price you’re willing to pay, and your vehicle’s towing capacity if you’re choosing a towable RV. Opt for a smaller RV for easier navigation if you can, especially if you’re a first-time renter.


For a towable RV, you’ll generally need a vehicle with a high towing capacity, a hitch rated at 5,000 pounds, and an electronic brake controller installed in your vehicle or the proper wiring to rent and attach one.In most states you need only a normal driver’s license to operate any RV recreationally, but some states do require a special commercial or non-commercial license for larger/heavier RVs. Check with your state’s Department of Transportation., Expect to see rental prices per night for RVs, and know that the same renter can have different per night rates depending on the season (usually rates are higher in peak vacation months like July and August). There could also be a per mile rate, which might be something like 34 to 45 cents per mile. Rates will also vary by the type, size, and condition (or age) of the RV.Note that some rental companies will want to place a hold on your credit card while you’re in possession of the vehicle.

, Expect extra costs beyond the rental rate for possible things like a security deposit, a small charge for the RV’s generator or propane, additional vehicle insurance, and the price for kitchen utensils and bedding if you’re not providing your own.Of course the cost of your trip will also include gas for the RV, campground rates, and food costs.

, Check out the For Rent ads in your local newspaper, Craigslist, or other classified ads for RV rentals. Many private owners will rent out their RVs for reasonable prices when they aren’t using them. Also check out local or national RV dealers with rental locations near you.

, Call up the renters you find to make sure they’re still offering the RV offered in their ad, and ask about any additional costs there are on top of the per night or per mile rate to get an idea of the true price you’d pay. Choose your favorites based on the best features and price, and narrow your options down to a number that you can reasonably spend the time to visit before booking and embarking on your trip.

, Call your prospects again to set up a time to meet. Get a thorough tour of the inside living space and ask to take a test drive if it’s a motorhome. Larger rental companies will be more equipped to give you a full tutorial, often including an educational video. No matter who you’re renting from, be sure to check that everything works properly and ask questions like:


How do I properly hitch and unhitch a towable RV?
How and where do I empty wastewater and sewage?
How and when do I run the generator, and at what cost?
How do I use the propane to light the stove, run the refrigerator, etc., and at what cost?

, You’ll usually need a driver’s license and car insurance for anyone that will drive or tow the RV. Get copies or receipts for any paperwork or transactions you complete.

, Make sure you understand all the upfront costs as well as charges you could face later for damages or generator and propane charges.

, Especially if you’re renting from a private seller, you may be able to compromise on a price. Let them know your budget, and see what they can offer you. Come up with a rate that they can agree on that doesn’t go over your maximum budget.


If you’re not happy with their final offer for rent, walk away from deal. They might come back to you with a lower price if they want to rent the RV quickly.

, Discuss with the renter if they have options for a payment plan. You make be able to make smaller payments over a longer period of time if you wish.

States like Florida, California and Arizona thrive on winter visitors, many of them avid RVers like yourself. These states also have the largest amount of RV Dealerships making the chances of selling your RV greater as well as faster.;
, Get a pen and paper ready and take notes. Ask questions like, Do you have a contract, how long is the contract for and what it entails? What are your fees? Who and where do you advertise with? Do you have a service facility? In order to legally sell your RV, all dealers must perform a certain degree of safety inspections, depending on the state you are in.


Last but not least, What sets you apart from your competitor? Any successful RV dealer will have a hidden selling feature that sets them apart from their competitors.

, Chances are you may know several people who own a RV. Ask them where they purchased their RV or had their recreational vehicle serviced and if they would recommend that dealership. Listen to their story in whole.


Take into consideration the details for their reason for recommending or not recommending that dealership. For instance, that dealership may specialize in their brand or type of RV making their experience a pleasurable one. Or if they do not recommend a dealership, ask them why. It may be they have an RV that a requires hard to find parts, or maybe they owe more than what the RV is worth, requiring a more specialized type of service or time frame.

, All to often the reviews you find on your local Yahoo or Google reviews are posted by angry customers or even other dealerships making it sound like they are angry customers. These are free, easy and readily available for competitors hurting for business.

, If your RV has problems, it is best to let them know up front. This doesn't necessarily mean they will not try to sell your RV, but it will give them some insight prior to the sale and any future problems it will cause to you, the dealership and the buyer.


Depending on the severity of problems, most minor repairs can wait till the RV is sold. The dealership may or may not charge you for these repairs, again it would depend on the severity of the problem.

, Just like selling your home or car, the better your RV looks, the more likely it will sell. Find out if the dealership of your choosing offers a detail service, what it entails and how much it will cost you.


You will need current drivers' license, current registration and insurance, Title, copy of most current Lien holder statement or payment coupon, Original copy of Lien Release (if title has lienholder listed on it but has been paid off), if the title listed in a Trust, you will need a copy of the trust paperwork, and death certificate.

Think about what you will be using your RV for and plan accordingly. You can still compare across types, but knowing generally what you want can help narrow your search and save you time and effort.;
, There are a number of different sites that have information about different manufacturers. However, you will usually have to pay a fee to get more complete information. But it is still worth a try with a free guide, because it might have just the information you are looking for.


A good place to start is http://www.nadaguides.com/rvs. This site has information about a huge number of different brands and models going back a number of years.

, There are a number of different consumer guides available that compare a large number of different brands and models. These guides often include the vehicle specs and recommended pricing information. While they can cost about $100, they can save you a good deal of money and stress in the long run.


Two popular guides can be purchased at the following sites:


JR Consumer. This site offers a complete guide in both ebook ($68) and hardcopy ($78) formats, as well as a number of supplementary products. The guides provide information about make and model, price, value, and customer satisfaction. The guides only include information about 3 or 4 model years, so if you are looking for an older RV, make sure to purchase the appropriate guide.

RV Consumer Group. This non-profit site offers guides for individual purchase ($78), or memberships that include a package of informational products ($139). The guide offers information about price, reliability, value, control, and vehicle specs.



, You can do an Internet search for something general, like “RV reviews,” or for a specific brand or model if you have something in mind.


Forums have the benefit of being free, but they do not usually have extremely specific information about a wide variety of models in a single place. Forums can be especially useful once you have narrowed your search.

, If you have friends who have purchased RVs before, ask them about their experiences. Are they satisfied with the RV they purchased? Would they recommend a different manufacturer? The more information you have, the better, so ask around as much as you can.

, When you feel that you are ready to actually go to an RV dealer, ask him or her for recommendations. Chances are, they will have good information about customer satisfaction from previous buyers. They may be able to give you information that you were not able to get from a consumer guide or online forum. It never hurts to get more first-hand information, so don’t be afraid to ask.

, Rust is the natural breakdown of iron and metal. RVs traveling in those parts of the country having snow and salt will be more prone to rust. Buying used motor homes from the south can help this rust problem, but they will cost more. If there is structural rust on the frames, it's better to avoid those motor homes as they are at their end of life.

, Service records will show the proper maintenance of the motor home maintained by the previous user. And if they fail to provide any paperwork, it’s advisable not to accept that used motor home.

, Finance companies offer better options for certain RV builders, on certain models particularly those that have low depreciation. The purchase of a used motor home should be done without a thorough inspection of the finance options attached to that RV.

Consider what kind of exhaust you have.
,
Inspect the existing system.,
Place cardboard under rear of vehicle where you will be working.,
Remove the old system.,
Now that the old system is gone, take a good look at your heater boxes.,
Look at the flange surfaces for the heater boxes and the new exhaust system.,While supporting the new exhaust in place, on the end opposite the tail pipe, put the first bolt, with washers, etc, through the exhaust flange, gasket – or two if necessary – and through the heater box flange and hand tighten.,
On the opposite end of the system, behind the tail pipe, try to get the holes to line up.,
Tighten everything up.,
Check your work.,
Reinspect everything a day later and then a week later.",How to Replace the Exhaust System on a 75 to 78 VW Bus,", Look over your stock system. Is it in good shape or maybe needs something simple, like replacing a hanger or tailpipe? Either leave it alone or do minor repairs. If it is stock, what you have is better than anything on the market., You might be able to do the work without jack stands or ramps. The cardboard will keep any crud that comes off the old system from getting on your driveway while protecting the new system from getting scratched up – scratches through the paint can make it rust faster., This may be as simple as removing the bolts at the flanges, then removing the hangar bolts and lowering it to the ground. Some penetrating lubricant on the nuts may help loosen them up. A number of areas are a bit difficult to get to with the old system in place, so don’t be afraid to cut the soon-to-be discarded pipes to make getting at bolt faces easier. Make sure the old exhaust is supported as you unbolt it to keep it from torquing the heat exchangers or anything else it may be attached to., Are they in good condition with no dents, major rust or other serious defects? If they are, then go ahead with the installation. But if your boxes are damaged, then replace them with a model that is compatible with replacement stock exhausts and use that exhaust configuration instead., Make sure they are smooth and flat. Crud can build up on the heater box side, especially if there were exhaust leaks through the old gaskets. Also, hold the replacement system in place to make sure the flanges are at least close to meeting up. A quarter inch offset is fine, but some of the kits being mass produced are coming out with flanges that are not even close. These need to be sent back. For minor defects in the mating surfaces of the flanges, either smooth them out yourself or take them to a machine shop and have them do it. Smooth surfaces are essential to preventing exhaust leaks.,, Don’t worry if they don’t meet exactly. If they come up short, take two garden shovels, placed the handles in the new exhaust system intake pipes and pry outward to make up some of the difference. They may still not align exactly, but should be close enough that you can place a big screwdriver through the exhaust flange, gasket and heat exchanger flange bolt hole and use it to gently leverage everything into place long enough to get the first bolt on that side. Then add the rest of the bolts through the flanges on both sides, hand tightening each., Now tighten the bolts the rest of the way down. The new exhaust should be secure to the heat exchangers. Now, tighten up any bolts for the hangers. Some of these are designed to allow some movement in the system, so don’t over-tighten any of those., Visually inspect the installation and wiggle the new exhaust to make sure it is not loose from the heat exchangers anywhere. With the van in neutral, the parking brake on and the wheels blocked, crank the engine and let run for a few minutes. Before the engine gets too hot, feel around where the flanges meet. If you have any leaks, you should be able to feel the exhaust blowing through them. Bolts may need to be tightened up at the flanges to compress the gaskets right. If that does not work, take the new system off and make sure again that the gaskets and mating surfaces are aligned right and smooth, with no defects. Again, sometimes you might have to use two gaskets to get a good seal with aftermarket exhaust systems., Exhaust systems heat and cool, plus they vibrate. This can loosen bolts and fasteners. It is a good idea to check that everything stays tight. After a week, it is a good idea to go over most areas like this every month or so to make sure nothing has come loose. It also does not hurt to keep an ear on your motor. Given the distinctive sound of the VW air-cooled engine, it’s usually easy to ear if you have even a relatively minor exhaust leak."

Do your retailer research.,
Check all maintenance records: Just like when you buy a car, buying a used recreational vehicle means that you need to make sure to check all the maintenance records.,
Look past the appearance: You should be ready to look past the clean and dig deeper when you are considering buying a used recreational vehicle.,
Get good advice: It is wise to take the RV you are interested in to someone before you make the final purchase.,
Set a budget: Once a budget is set, it is important to stick to it!,
Try before you buy: If you've never driven a motor home or anything larger than a car then it is important that you try before you buy!",How to Buy a Used Motor Home," Look up local (and not so local) options for retailers.


Ask around. The best way to find an honest, reputable RV dealer is by word of mouth.
Use the Internet. Type the year, manufacturer and model of the recreational vehicle you are interested in. This will save you a lot of time sifting through all of the recreational vehicle websites.
Let your local recreational vehicle dealer know what you are looking for. If they are interested in you, they will do a search to help you find that perfect RV.
Use Craigslist. If your willing to travel, Craigslist can be an amazing tool to find your perfect RV at the perfect price.;
, If there are none, do not waste your time. When the records are not kept, that might mean that the engine will not be in as good a shape as you would like. Do not be afraid about asking for the records, either. Anyone who is looking to sell their RV should be willing to provide them.

, A used RV will be clean when it is time to sell, but has not been maintained for the long term. Look in the crevices and smell past the cleaning supplies to the real odor of the RV. Also, look at the driver and passenger seats. You will often be able to tell how well maintained the vehicle was based off the seats.

, If you can, choose someone who knows about recreational vehicles. You might also want to consider getting a guidebook to teach you what to look for in a used RV so that you will not be taken for a ride.

, If you're new to motor homing and this is your first motor home then it is wise to check out the prices from a variety of different dealers. This should help give you an idea of how much you should expect to spend on the vehicle.


Remember though, that there are other costs involved when you purchase a motor home. You must make sure that you can afford to run the vehicle, so find out how much it costs to 'fill up' and remember, fuel prices are not going down! Other important considerations are: regular servicing costs, the cost of motor home insurance and in some cases the cost of storing your new vehicle.

, Make sure you book your test drive(s) ahead of time to avoid being disappointed, and ensure you plan a route that includes various different types of driving; from motorway driving to city/town driving.


Ensure there is a steep hill included, and try parking the vehicle - first timers can find parking larger vehicles tricky so be realistic about your abilities. If you find driving such a large vehicle difficult at this stage then it may well be worth considering something smaller.

Check a bank’s repo list.,
Buy from a repo reseller.,
Try buying from a dealer.",How to Buy Foreclosed RVs1," Ask your bank or credit union if they allow you to view their repo list. Look at this list to view and bid on the vehicles the lender has repossessed and is looking to sell, which may include RVs.Note that the benefit of using this option is that you can finance the RV through the bank directly, and often with low or 0% interest rates. On the other hand, the downside is that lenders typically don’t spend the money to clean or fix up repossessed vehicles before selling.
If you’re interested in a repo RV sold directly from a lender, ask how the vehicle was repossessed. An RV turned in voluntarily is typically in much better shape than one that had to be seized from an uncooperative owner.;
, Check out auctions held by resellers of repossessed RVs, which is the most common and popular way to buy them. Check out resellers’ websites and local ads for to view and bid on their options or find out the location of an in-person auction.


Note that the advantage of buying from a reseller at auction is that they fix up the vehicles well, and are more interested in moving a high volume of inventory than marking up the starting price. Just beware of those that charge a “viewing cost” or any other unnecessary upfront charges.Take note that it can be difficult to find quality RVs in a very large inventory of vehicles in all different conditions. Stay away from any that don’t have a title with them or the reseller claims the title is “in transit,” as it can be nearly impossible for you to claim ownership without one., Try a used RV dealer to check out the repossessed RVs they’ve purchased at auction and fixed up. Note that this method doesn’t offer as much savings on RVs as others do, but buying from a dealer eliminates the bidding process and may give you more options for financing and warranties.Consider the advantages of buying repo RVs from a dealer. Dealers purchase these RVs at auction and will then do a good job of cleaning them up, replacing some items, and even doing minor repairs, so the RVs are in better shape when sold.
Know that the downside is that dealers will hike up the price on the repo RVs that they’ve fixed up. Unless you can spot a problem and are a savvy negotiator, you’ll end up paying about the same price as any other used RV."

Know about campers before jumping into a purchasing decision.,
Start your camper search locally by first hitting the classified section of the newspaper, and then follow that up by checking the vehicle inventory of your local vehicle lots.

,
Move to a regional search by doing the same thing, but look up information on the closest large city or metropolitan area around you.,
Expand your search to a national one by using online tools to help find the best camper for you.,
Contact the seller and discuss price and how you plan to get the vehicle to you.,
Check out the camper vehicle before you purchase it.,
Test drive the vehicle, but also look it over after you have done the drive.",How to Buy a Used Camper,"


Because campers depreciate so quickly, you can purchase a relatively newer model far cheaper than you can purchase a brand new one.
Inspecting the camper to make sure that the vehicle has no mechanical problems is key to a good purchase.
Purchasing a camper from a private-party seller can often be cheaper than buying off a new or used camper lot, BUT not always...most private party owners will owe money on their campers and will be upside down. So, compare deals that you can get private party with deals at your local dealer.;
,, The larger the town, the higher likelihood that you will find what you are looking for.

,


Search for a camper by type, make or location at http://www.rvt.com/.

The site http://www.rvtraderonline.com/ lets you look for vehicles being sold both by individuals as well as campers being sold by dealers.
Search on the internet for RV Dealers (insert your city here). Most dealers have websites.

, Your best bet, though, is to go to that location and drive the vehicle back home. This will allow you to test drive the vehicle before signing any agreement with the selling party.

,


Inspect the chassis for cracked tires, dents, brake line wear, fluid leaks, a properly-mounted hitch, a present spare tire that is in good condition, an up-to-date emissions test and lube points that look properly maintained.
Look at the roof for damage or leaks.
Check not only the interior of the vehicle but the engine as well.

, You want to make sure that there are no obvious issues such as oil leaks.

Find out what storage can be used for storing your personal items.,
Think about decoration.,
If you have siblings and you don't get a wall or other design area, don't fret.,
Find some friends.,
Help with cleaning your R.V.,
Be aware of the differences in each room from a stationary house.,
Life may be different but with a few personal touches, an R.V.",How to Survive Living in an RV (kids)," Start off with the essentials:


clothing






bedding






and any other needs






When it comes to pleasure items, you will have to keep the list low. The more people who are trying to fit in the R.V., the less space you personally will have. Take the most special and most used toys. If you plan to take furniture, take smaller items and remember that they have to be secured or they will shift when driving. You can put extra items in storage units.





;
, If you have one or more siblings, try to convince your parents to let each of you have at least one cabinet to himself or herself; that way you have a sort of private storeroom.

, If it's just you and a parent or you and one sibling then it will be easy to decorate. Try to get a spot next to your bed. You can velcro up pictures or posters or other items you want on the wall space. Your bedding and choice in pillows can also be reflective, a rug can help. The curtains you choose for your window can also help. If you get a shelf you can tack or tape fake flowers or vines or pictures or hang a sign on the front and sides to give it a nice feel.

, That cabinet will work perfectly as a locker, you should do this even if you have a space you can decorate. In this ""locker"" you can velcro up small pictures or white erase boards. Taping colored paper on the sides also helps. If it doesn't already have a shelf get one of those cheap locker shelves. If it doesn't have a light you can put up a removable hook on the top and hang a book light from it for lighting.

, Look for someone who stops about the same time you do at a truck stop or other place every so often to empty the sewage and fill the water tank.

, It's a task that must be done and for the most part it's the same as cleaning any other house. Make your bed, pick up your toys, vacuum, scrub the toilet, wash the windows. Unless you're a teenager you probably won't have to take care of the car aspect of the R.V.

,


living room - this will probably be a little sofa, a t.v. and maybe a few other chairs. Most of the sofas fold out. There is less room to play in the living room but the amount varies by R.V.






Dining room - This is probably a booth seat with a table. It's only difference is the chairs






Kitchen - This room might be smaller then your used to but generally still has a sink, a fridge, a freezer, an oven, and a few cabinets






Bathroom - the bathroom is averagely a normal size maybe a little tighter squeeze but not necessarily much






Bedroom - there are very many types of bedrooms in R.V.s and for the most part they are all smaller than the normal bedroom

Check the rest of the market.,
Research the RV.,
Inspect the RV thoroughly.",How to Buy Foreclosed RVs2," Check out other auctions or reseller’s websites to look at common prices, especially for RVs of a similar make and model or similar condition to one you’re interested in. Be wary or prepared to negotiate on starting bids or asking prices that seem much higher than others in the market.


Consult the NADA Guide for the RV model you’re interested in to find out the low value for the specific make and model. Make sure a seller isn’t asking a rate that’s higher than its true value, and that you’re prepared to bid no more than it’s really worth.Consider that you want to pay less for a repo RV than you would if buying a regular used RV from a dealer or a private seller, especially if you don’t have a lot of information about the vehicle. Considering all the unknowns about the previous owner, the risk to you warrants a significant price reduction.

, Determine whatever information you can about an RV you’re interested in from a lender, reseller, or dealer. Then do any additional research you need to to find out if you’re getting a fair price and a good value considering the risk and quality of the vehicle.


Look for sellers that provide photos, vehicle histories, VIN numbers, and certified titles. The more information provided upfront the better, as it usually means the RV is in better shape, you can do better research, and you are closer to getting it road-ready.If there are known repairs that need to be made on an RV, get a quote from an auto repair shop for the estimated amount it would cost to fix them, and factor that into your budget and considerations.

, Determine when and for how long you are able to inspect a repo RV you’re interested in, and look it over thoroughly for possible damage. You might be able to schedule an appointment in advance, or view a unit along with the public before the start of an auction. You may even be able to test-drive a motorhome or truck camper.


Bring along an experienced mechanic or an RV expert to your inspection if you can. Get the fullest assessment possible about the car’s conditions and possible problems so you know exactly what you’re bidding on or buying.
If you are buying a repo RV from another state and can’t inspect it in person, hire an independent inspection service or trusted mechanic to look at the RV for you."
"
Know your budget.,
Understand the terms and conditions from the seller.,
Pick up your RV and make it street legal.",How to Buy Foreclosed RVs3," Use your knowledge from the given vehicle information, your inspection, and your research to come up with an amount you will not go over when bidding on the RV you want. Then place your bid or multiple bids up to a price no higher than this amount.


Pay attention to the starting bid given by the seller as well, and start your bidding at or just above this price.
If you bid online, you may be able to set a maximum bid and enable absent bidding, allowing the system to bid for you up to your max amount., Review all contracts, terms, and conditions provided by the bank, reseller, or dealer regarding the bidding process and sale of an RV. Make sure you read any instructions and disclaimers carefully so you understand what you’re obligated to.


Some resellers will require that you meet with a broker to ensure that you understand the terms of sale or the auction process before you can make a bid or offer.Know that in general, you are bound to the sale of a repo RV once you place a bid on it, and the sale is “as is.” This means that any issue or problem you find after the sale cannot be disputed, even if it wasn’t documented by the seller. The sale is final, and without warranty., Receive your RV whenever you have outbid other bidders, made payment, and signed necessary documents. Just like any other car or trailer, you need to ensure that it can legally be driven in your state before you can enjoy using it.


Re-title the vehicle in your name, get it insured, registered, and any other repairs or replacements done in order to make it street legal. Check with your state or county if there are any additional steps you need to take for an RV in particular.
If you bid on an RV from a bank’s repo list, you may need to wait to find out if your bid was accepted after they compare with other offers. Only then can you perform an inspection of the unit before you sign the final paperwork, make payment, and take the RV home."

Figure out just how many people will be traveling with you.,
Always consider the next berth up when renting a motor home.,
Decide on just how many facilities you would need and how self sufficient you would expect to be.,
Think about how long a trip you will be taking and how long you will be actually traveling as opposed to how much time you might be spending at a campsite.,
Understand that some areas and roads have restrictions when it comes to sizes and widths.,
Check camping ground and holiday parks to see if they can facilitate the size of your vehicle beforehand.,
Make sure you rent accordingly to your budget.,
Booking well in advance often ensures a lower rate.,
An absolute must: Check the terms and conditions thoroughly.",How to Choose a Motorhome or Campervan to Rent," This would help you decide upon how many beds that you would need. This is the first thing to consider and must be right the first time. This will help you to narrow your choices.;
, Why? There is more storage space and there is less hassle of assembling and reassembling dining and kitchen areas; you have the area dedicated to these purposes. For example, if two people are traveling in a four berth motor home, you can have your sleeping quarters and dining area permanently made up and you won't have to break it down when needed. Plus, you get extra storage area. This is especially important the longer you rent the vehicle.

, Possibilities include toilet, heating, shower, kitchen, storage, batteries or power and gas heating. Check to see if these facilities require outside power sources or if they are self contained within the vehicle. E.g, some vehicles require additional power to operate additional appliances, or you may want to save your generator/battery by using an outside power source.

, Understand that fresh water and waste water tanks can mean frequent refilling and emptying of cassettes and tanks. Waste should generally should be emptied 2 to 3 days or this can cause some unwanted odors to linger in your motor home.

, Consider the width restrictions on the area you would be visiting to make sure that it would not be too wide on the roads you will be driving on. Consider the flexibility and the maneuverability and dimensions, especially with high tops.

, Prior research of parks and roads is essential, especially when traveling with a larger motor home.

, You might decide to rent an older vehicle rather than a brand new one. Prices are also determined by the amenities you choose. One warning, you do get what you pay for, what may seem to be a bargain at first could turn into a nightmare when you rent the vehicle. If going for a budge vehicle, ensure that the vehicle is well maintain and the company offers 24 hour roadside assistance., You pay for spontaneity. Check what the off season rates are and book then - these will vary per country. Booking prior to holidays (e.g school holidays, public holidays like the 4th of July) can save you money., Each company has unique policies that vary for various circumstances.

Make sure you’ve first considered other options.,
Don’t assume that just because someone has a car, they can give you a ride.,
Decide whom you’ll ask.,
Don’t beat around the bush.,
Don’t put them on the spot.,
Offer to help pay for gas.,
Take no for an answer.,
Make it as easy as possible for the person who is giving you the ride.,
Be pleasant in the car.,
Plan to reciprocate.",How to Ask Someone for a Ride," As mentioned in the introduction, there are plenty of alternate ways of getting somewhere. Think about whether it might be possible to walk, bike, or take a bus, train, cab, or rideshare. If none of these options are available to you, or they would require unreasonable hardship, then you might consider asking someone for a lift. A good rule of thumb when asking someone a favor is to make sure that the benefit to you significantly outweighs the inconvenience it might cause the other person.;
, While whether or not someone owns or has easy access to a car is the first thing you should consider when deciding to ask for a ride, don’t make assumptions about their availability or willingness. Even if they’ve given you a ride once, twice, or a hundred times before, don’t take it for granted that they’ll be able to help you every time you need to get somewhere.

, If you have a relationship with someone where you’re already in the practice of regularly doing favors for each other, such as those that are common between family members, romantic partners, or close friends, this is ideal. Otherwise, consider who might be least inconvenienced by your request.


If you need a ride home from work, consider asking the coworker that you know drives by your street every day, anyway. Or if you are going to dinner with a group of friends, maybe ask the friend that lives closest to you for a lift to the restaurant.
Make sure you consider lifestyle factors, too. If you have a friend with two small children, or who’s been working a lot of overtime lately, they will likely need to be more conservative with their extra time and energy than your friend who teaches guitar lessons three afternoons a week and still lives with his parents. If your cousin wakes up early every morning for her job, you probably don’t want to ask her for a ride to the airport to catch your red eye flight. Or a friend who works as a bartender probably won’t be very excited about bringing you to pick up your car from the body shop at seven a.m. on a Saturday.
It’s extremely important that you know the other person well enough to be sure you feel safe spending time alone with them. It’s never a good idea to get into a car with a near-stranger, or someone with whom you don’t feel comfortable.

, When you’ve decided whom you’ll ask, you’ll want to be forthcoming about your intentions at the beginning of the conversation. If you try to make small talk about other things first the entire conversation can come off as disingenuous when you finally come around to the point. It’s also a good idea to begin the conversation with something along the lines of “Hi so-and-so, I have a favor to ask you…”. Not only is this appropriately straightforward, but using the word “favor” also shows that you understand the person would be going our of their way for you, whereas “Could you please give me a ride to work tomorrow?” could run the risk of sounding like a command, and therefore off-putting. , If you know you are going to need a ride somewhere, don’t wait until the last minute to ask. Give the other person as much advance notice as possible, so that they can factor it into their schedule that day.


This also goes for asking for a ride in front of other people. Many people have a difficult time saying no if there is an audience, and they might suspect that you are capitalizing on this.

, While this is recommended any time you take a ride from someone, it is an absolute must in the instance that someone is picking you up and bringing you somewhere they don’t also need to be, such as the airport, a doctor’s appointment, or a job interview.


Often people will refuse to take your money, but don’t count on this! Make sure you have cash on had to give them, just in case.

, If someone says they’re unable to give you a ride, don’t press the issue. Resist asking for an explanation, and don’t argue or challenge them. Instead, be gracious and thank them for their time.

, Putting in a little extra time and effort on your end shows the person that you are taking their time and effort into consideration, and that you value the favor they are doing for you. Here are a few examples of ways you might make the experience easier for them:


If your destination is a place regularly frequented by most people, such as the grocery store, offer to accompany them whenever they are next planning to go, rather than requesting they make a special trip.
If you live at the corner of a difficult intersection, offer to walk a block or two in order to meet them where it’s easier to pull over.
If they are giving you a ride somewhere that they may have never been before, make sure you have clear directions, or have the address already plugged into the map function on your smart phone.
Be ready to go at least five minutes before you expect them to show up, so that they won’t have to wait for you in the instance that they are running a few minutes ahead of schedule.

, Try to make the other person’s experience of being in the car with you as enjoyable as possible. This is not only respectful, but it will also increase the likelihood of this person agreeing to help you in the future. Often being pleasant is just a matter of not doing certain annoying things:


Don’t criticize the person’s car, for instance, no matter how beat up or messy it is.
Don't criticize their driving, and avoid being a ""backseat driver"".
Don’t fiddle with any of the car’s dials. Even if they are listening to most boring talk radio station ever, or the air conditioning is freezing your face off. If you absolutely must, ask the driver politely if they'd be willing to change the radio station or turn the air down.
Don’t be a chatterbox. If the other person wants to talk, that’s great! But if they don’t seem like they are interested in chatting, let yourself be comfortable with the silence. Some people need quiet in order to concentrate while they drive, or they might be particularly interested in what they’re listening to on the radio.

, While you might not be able to pay the person back in kind, you should still find a way to show your appreciation. What this entails exactly will depend on your preexisting relationship with the person, and the degree of inconvenience to them.


If you get a ride home from a coworker who lives in the same building as you, a simple text saying “Thanks again for the ride! I really appreciate it!” might suffice. But if a friend wakes up at three thirty in the morning to drive you an hour to the airport, you probably want to consider something a little more meaningful. Perhaps you can pick them up a small gift on your trip, or treat them to dinner when you get back.
However, if you are dealing with prohibitive financial issues and can’t afford a gift or dinner, a thoughtful, hand-written thank you card will work, too.
Make sure to do this after they have agreed to help you, as otherwise it can seem like you’re trying to obligate them. For instance, don’t bake your friend cookies and as she’s biting into the first one, ask her for a ride to the dentist next Friday. "

Fill your car up with gas in advance, preferably the night before.,
Limit multitasking when others are in the car.,

Avoid eating when ridesharing in another car pooler’s car, For example, the scent of an egg muffin sandwich can be overwhelming.,
Be early.",How to Behave in a Carpool," Don’t wait until you’ve picked everyone up to fill your gas tank. This is time consuming and you could risk breaking down.;
, When you are stuck in traffic, avoid talking on the phone, listen to music, read the paper and eat a full course meal.

,, In other words, don’t give the driver any unsolicited driving lessons. Shouting “look out!” and “don’t let that idiot cut you off” can be very distracting to a driver when car pooling.

, If you’re car pooling or ridesharing with co-workers or friends, that is one thing – they are used to it. But when you’re car pooling with strangers, talking too much can be very irritating, especially during the early morning hours. I remember car pooling to Brooklyn every morning and one particular passenger would talk non-stop. Even if I was pretending to be asleep to keep her from talking, she would still carry on a conversation. So, if no one else is talking, keep quiet.

,, You also want to avoid having any unnecessary accidents such as spilling coffee or tea all over the driver’s car seat.

, When you’re late, you are causing your fellow car pooling passengers to be late as well. You should be standing by your door at least 5 to 10 minutes before the driver arrives.

Purchase an awning kit.,
Select a location for your awning.,
Use a felt tip marker to mark where the ends of the awning will be.,
Draw a straight line between the two marks.,
Place the two end mounting brackets approximately three inches inside the end marks.,
Place the third mounting bracket directly in the middle of the chalk line.,
Drill holes for the mounting bracket screws.,
Coat the provided screws in a water-tight sealant.,
Attach the mounting brackets.,
Hang the camper awning over the mounting brackets.,
Extend the awning.,
Make torsion adjustments.,
Consider purchasing a “deflapper.” This part will be installed halfway down the awning and will reduce flapping.,
Skew your awning slightly.",How to Install a Camper Awning," Most packages contain stainless steel mounting brackets, silver reflective material, and extra fiberglass poles to combat against the wind.;
, Though most awnings are placed on the front of the camper above the door, this is entirely up to you. You can put the awning on any wall of the camper that is long enough and thick enough. If you choose to put your awning on the backside of your camper, it will just mean that you have to walk around the camper to enjoy the shade.

, You can use a tape measurer to measure along your camper and find the best place for your awning. Make sure the walls of the camper are at least 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick in this area to ensure the camper is structurally strong enough to hold the weight of the awning. You can confirm this in your owner’s manual or measure the thickness of the wall in an opening such as doorway or window.Another way to measure the wall thickness is to drill a screw all the way through and mark it on the other side of the wall. Pull the screw back out and measure from the head of the screw to the mark and that will be your wall thickness. Be wary of making extra holes in your camper, though.

, It will help to have at least two helpers for this task. Have one person on either end holding either a chalk line or a straight edge of some kind. As they hold, snap the chalk line or trace a line down the straight edge., Use the felt tip marker to mark the hole on each bracket. This will mark where you need to drill later., Again, use your felt tip marker to make a mark for drilling. You can find the middle by measuring the distance from one point to the next and making a mark, at the halfway point. For example, if it’s ten feet from mark to mark, you would mark the five foot point as your middle.You can then set the brackets aside for now.

, Use the drill bit size recommended in the awning manufacturer’s instructions, as different awnings may require slightly different sized screws. Drill straight through the holes you previously marked.Most of the time you will use a 3/16 drill bit for these holes., Use a sealant such as silicone. This will seal the hole around the screws and prevent water from entering your camper., Use a screwdriver and the provided screws to screw the brackets into the holes that you drilled.Using a drill will over-torque the screws and make the structure weaker., You will need to slide the attachment hooks on the brackets into the awning. This will secure the awning to the brackets., Pull out the support legs until the awning canopy is positioned properly., Torsion adjustments can usually be made with a knob located at the side of the awning. This will adjust how tightly the awning is stretched while extended., This will increase the longevity of your awning by preventing wear and tear due to flapping., As long as one end is slightly higher than the other, the awning will be pitched. This will allow any water to flow off to one side rather than be stagnant on the top of your awning."

Decide on a departure point.,
Decide who's driving.,
Set up a schedule.,
Calculate the costs.,
Decide how people will pay up.,
Make some ground rules.,
Keep everyone in touch.,
Leave a little extra room in the schedule to allow for routine delays, and drive to keep your passengers comfortable so you all arrive relaxed and refreshed and they might even get some work done during the ride.",How to Carpool," The first step is to figure out where everyone will meet. You have three options here, each with their pros and cons:


The home of the driver. This is the ideal arrangement if everybody lives walking distance from each other, but it can get confusing if people take turns driving.
A convenient location, such as a park-and-ride lot next to the highway, or a lot that's centrally located among all of the participants.
Driver picks everyone up. Again, this works best if the participants live close together, and it can be impractical if you rotate drivers (like if the person who lives closest to the destination has to drive 10 minutes further away just to pick someone up).
An added bonus is that the people who aren't driving that day can be completely car-free, possibly letting someone else in the house use it, which can enable some households to give up one of their cars; this will help you save money.

;
, One person can drive all the time, while the riders chip in for gas and maintenance, or everyone can take turns driving. This can depend on a few different factors:


Who has the most fuel efficient car? If one person in the carpool has a gas guzzler and another person has a hybrid, then it might be in the group's best interest to use the hybrid more often, because then everyone pays less for gas. This does, however, put more wear and tear on the hybrid.
Who has the most comfortable car? If you carpool every day with several people for a long commute, a spacious interior might make things a little more enjoyable for everyone. There might also be the awkward situation in which one person has an uncomfortable car (no A/C or heat, for example).
Who's in the best location? Sometimes it makes the most sense for the person who's furthest away from the destination to pick everyone up, presuming the homes are on the way to the destination.

, Figure out what time to meet, or what times people will get picked up. This might take a little trial and error, so be conservative when you start.

, For every day that you're carpooling, you should know who's driving and for how many miles. (If you all meet at the same spot every day, the number of miles won't vary.) You should also get a good estimate on each vehicle's fuel efficiency if you're going to rotate drivers and if some vehicles are much more fuel efficient than others. Be sure to account for maintenance costs, as well, especially if one person drives all or most of the time--gas is not the only cost. Here are some estimates for 2008 (US) which include the cost of fuel, maintenance, tires, insurance, etc.:


small sedan - $0.42/mile
medium sedan - $0.55/mile
large sedan - $0.65/mile
4WD sports utility - $0.70/mile
minivan - $0.57/mile

, For each day on your carpooling schedule, you should now know how much the driver is owed. Make a list for each day of the carpooling schedule, and divide the cost by the number of people in the carpool for that day--that'll be how much each person owes the driver on that day.


Monday, Trudy, 60 miles, large sedan: $39 ($10 per person)
Tuesday, Janice, 60 miles, large sedan: $39 ($10 per person)
Wednesday, John, 65 miles, small sedan: $27 ($7 per person)
Thursday, Ron, 55 miles, medium sedan: $30 ($7.50 per person)

, Ideally, you should have a little meeting to discuss these issues, or else they could create some discomfort and disagreements down the line:


smoking in the car
choice of music
how long you wait if someone's late
payment dates/deadlines
food and drink in the car
unscheduled stops
work gossip
talking on cell phones
put on perfume/cologne AFTER carpooling

, Make a list of everyone in the carpool and how they can be contacted. If anyone doesn't need a ride or can't drive, it's important to have a chain of communication set up to prevent misunderstandings and inconvenience.

, But don't micromanage your fellow carpoolers' driving.

"
Regularly check and re-tighten all wheel nuts.,
Clear out all vents, window seals and door seals whenever possible.,
Test the handbrake before and after every journey.,
Regularly check and clean all road lights and electricals.,
Keep the battery charged.,
Ensure that the water in your supply system is changed frequently.,
Keep your caravan covered whenever possible.,
Ensure that the tires are always fully inflated: Although it seems relatively obvious, keeping out caravans tires full inflated is a very important part of any maintenance program; under-inflated tires can place incredible strain on your caravan’s axle, and also increase the risk of damage being caused to wheel rims.,
Regularly air out your caravan: Opening windows and doors for a few hours at regular intervals will help to prevent the air in your caravan from becoming stale, and also help to prevent mold from growing in any damp-prone corners or edges.,
Test your smoke alarm.",How to Maintain and Protect a Caravan," Over time, wheel nuts will slowly work themselves loose. Using your caravan when its wheel nuts are loose can leave you vulnerable to dangerous and potentially expensive accidents so make sure that you always double check that they are adjusted to the manufacturers recommendations (usually between 90-110nm) using a torque wrench before using your caravan, or before storing it for long periods of time;
, Dirt and grime can quickly build up in and around the vents and seals that perforate your caravan’s bodywork. Left unattended, this buildup can prevent proper airflow and potentially damage the rubber seals that are needed to prevent rain-water etc. from penetrating your investment. Regularly clean out these weak points using a soft brush or scraper whenever you get the chance – doing so will help to prolong the longevity of your caravan, and ensure that it keeps you warm and safe during cold nights.

, The drum on a caravan’s handbrake is particularly prone to rust, corrosion and general wear. By testing it before and after every trip, you can help to ensure that it’ll never cut out on you unexpectedly; damaging your caravan and putting you at serious risk of accident or injury. According to the caravanning magazine’s helpful technical guides, the best way to test a caravan handbrake, just apply and then release at least three times. As long as there is no obvious grating, and the brake applies smoothly, it is in perfect working order.

, One of the most important safety features on a caravan are the road lights, and making sure that these are kept in good working order is one of the key parts to maintaining your caravan properly. Test them at least once before and after every trip by getting the caravan hooked up to the car, and then getting someone to stand at the rear and act as a spotter for any issues or problems. To keep them clean, just ensure that you wipe down the lenses whenever they become dirty, and check for any water seeping down in front of the bulb.

, According to the Camping and Caravanning Club’s guide to powering a caravan, a caravan’s leisure battery will normally last between 7 and 8 days when fully charged, but it’s important to remember that discharging a battery below the 50% mark will prevent it from ever being fully charged again, so always ensure that the battery is fully charged by plugging it into a voltmeter before you leave on a trip – readings of 12.7-12.3 indicate a fully charged battery, while readings of 11 indicate near complete discharge.

, Left for long periods of time, the water in your system can become stale and unpleasant. It can also begin to damage the pipe seals throughout your caravan. Drain it at least once a season using the built-in valves, and use this opportunity to check for any signs of leakage. Provided everything looks ok, you can refill the main tank and pressure test all taps and showers.

, Over time, dust, resin, bird mess and excessive amounts of sunlight can all have a tremendous impact on the structural integrity of your caravan – exposure to the elements damages seals, vents and electrical connections as well as causing discolouration of the caravans shell. The best way to avoid this is to keep your caravan covered with a water-proof cover. Providing that the cover is made of a breathable fabric, and fits properly, it can be used to prevent damage to your caravan whenever it’s not in transit, and could considerably prolong the life of your investment

, Whenever you’re in transit, take the time to double check your caravan’s tire pressure at a garage or service station; paying close attention to the manufactures recommended PSI.

, Once mold has started to colonize the inside of your caravan it can be relatively difficult to destroy, so take steps early to ensure that you’re not creating the kind of environment that will encourage fungal invasion.

, It’s easy to forget, but a fully functioning smoke alarm can save lives, so make sure part of your regular maintenance schedule leaves room for a quick test – depressing the ‘test’ button on most modern smoke alarms is all that’s needed to ensure that the electricals and sensors are all still functioning correctly.

Know what voltage your battery is.,
Turn on your voltmeter and select DC voltage.,
Touch the voltmeter's red lead to the positive terminal of your battery.,
Read your screen or indicator (if your meter isn't digital).,
Anything less than 12.5 or 6.35 volts indicates your battery needs to be charged or replaced (if its charge depletes quickly).

",How to Check Your RV Battery2," Most commonly, you will have a 12-volt battery, but sometimes you can have a 6-volt battery.

, Open the hood of the RV.

, Place the black lead on your battery's negative terminal.

, A 12-volt battery should read between 12.5 and 12.7 volts when it isn't being used. A 6-volt battery should read between 6.25 and 6.35 volts.

,"
"
Put on protective gear and open the hood.

,
Remove the vent caps if your battery is not a sealed system.

,
Check the electrolyte levels in each cell.,
Fill a hydrometer and drain it twice for each cell before taking a reading.

,
Test the electrolyte level from a cell using the hydrometer and then drain the water back into its own cell.,
Test all cells and then replace your vent covers.",How to Check Your RV Battery3,",, Refer to your battery's instructions if you are unsure of the levels in your battery cells.

,, Record the number for each cell.

, Your specific gravity reading for each cell should be between 1.235 and 1.277.


If the readings of all the cells average below 1.277 you will need to charge your battery.
If there is a difference of .050 or more between the highest cell reading and the lowest cell reading, your lowest cell is probably weak or dead and your battery may need to be replaced.

There are no definite “right” or “wrong” reasons, though, so a reason that seems solid to you will usually be enough.


Retirees and individuals who frequently relocate due to their jobs are among those who usually choose to live in an RV full-time. That being said, if you want to live a simpler life or long to travel across country, this can be a good life choice for you, too.;
, Even though living in an RV evokes a sense of freedom, the truth of the matter is that you'll be living in very close quarters with your family members and spending many, many hours with them. If anyone opposes the lifestyle, the divide will create unwanted and inescapable tension in your everyday life.


If you have kids under the age of 18, make sure that your kids agree to the idea along with your spouse. The entire family should also prepare to undertake the challenge of homeschooling.

, If you've never spent a prolonged period of time in an RV, it's a good idea to try before you buy. Rent or borrow and RV and try vacationing in it for one week to one month. Doing so should give you a better idea of what long-term RV life might be like.Even if you have experience driving or hauling large trailers, you need to have the experience of actually living in an RV. Get a good idea of what it's like to drive the vehicle, organize and schedule your drives, budget for life on the road, and live day-to-day with only the necessities.

, In many cases, you won't need a special driver's license to drive or haul an RV, but there are some exceptions. Research the licensing laws in the state of your permanent address and fulfill those requirements before you make any other preparations.


Check with the state DMV to determine the legal requirements. Some notably large motorhomes may require you to obtain a different license for a different vehicle class, but you shouldn't need a commercial driver's license since an RV is a personal vehicle., Life is unpredictable, and there are numerous things that could go wrong and prevent you from continuing RV life for prolonged periods of time. Have an alternate way of living planned out in case of an emergency.If your RV breaks down or if you develop medical problems that prevent you from traveling, you will need to figure out where to stay and how to pay for the associated costs.
Make sure that you have adequate insurance for your RV and for your own health.
Try to keep a savings account that will allow you to live for one full year without your RV.
If possible, work things out with relatives or friends so that you can stay with them for one or two months in case of an emergency.

, Generally speaking, there are three main RV types used for full-time living: travel trailers, fifth wheels, and motorhomes. The best choice will depend on what you want and what you can afford.Travel trailers are bumper-pulled campers. They're the cheapest option, but also the smallest.
Fifth wheels are larger RVs that you can hitch to the bed of a truck. They're larger than travel trailers and less costly than motorhomes, but you'll still need a separate truck to tow it.
Motorhomes are the most expensive and most convenient option. They offer more storage space, and you can drive the motorhome directly instead of hitching it to another vehicle.

, Some RVs are not approved for full-time use, so if they break down, the cost of repairs may fall outside of any warranty you have for the vehicle. Read all the fine print before you finalize the purchase to avoid any unpleasant surprises.

, Simple put, you won't be able to have as many possessions in an RV as you can have in a conventional home. Plan on getting rid of anything you don't need or putting it away into storage.


Sort through your belongings and take only what you need rather than clinging to what you want. If you aren't able to give up your unnecessary belongings, this probably isn't the right lifestyle for you.
Getting rid of your excess stuff is usually the best option. Sell as much as you can for the excess money, then donate or discard anything else.
For things of personal value (heirlooms, keepsakes, photographs), consider giving them to other family members or keeping them in storage. You'll need to factor storage fees into your monthly budget if you rent space, though.
If you plan on keeping your fixed home or apartment, you can always keep the excess stuff there. This is the most expensive option, but it might be wise if you think there's a chance you'll change your mind about living in an RV.

, You don't need to maintain a fixed apartment or house, but you do need to have some type of permanent address for the sake of taxes and other legal purposes.


All states require proof of residency before you can obtain and maintain a driver's license from that state. You'll also need an address to open a bank account and maintain utility accounts. In many cases, having a post office box many not be enough, and you may need an actual permanent address.
If you cannot afford to maintain a fixed apartment or house, consider using the address of adult children or other family members (with their permission, of course). Some mail forwarding services will also give you the necessary street address to fulfill these needs.

, Each mail forwarding company can be somewhat different, but in general, these services will collect your mail and forward it to you depending on where you're scheduled to be.


Research different companies and service plans. Prices start as low as $9 per month but can vary depending on complexity, so pick one that fits with your budget and your needs.
Depending on the service, you might have the option of classifying mail into separate categories, including: forward, scan, trash, or hold. You can also choose the frequency with which mail gets shipped to your location.
Some services will also come with a physical street address that you can use for the shipment of packages and legal purposes.

, For important mail, consider going paperless and relying on Internet-based billing and banking. Doing so will prevent your bills from getting lost in the mail and reduce the risk of incurring late payment fees.

, Nowadays, many RV parks do offer some form of WiFi service, but you shouldn't rely on that service to stay connected to the outside world. Invest in a reliable cell phone plan and a mobile WiFi system—commonly called MiFi—to maintain a more consistent connection.


Since WiFi at campgrounds and other free access points can be unreliable, investing in a MiFi system will be your best option if you need consistent access to the Internet.
Shop around for the best cell phone plan, too. While there are many factors to consider, one of the most important points to look at is coverage reliability. You'll need a plan that covers a wide range of locations across the country.

, RV life isn't free, so you'll need to know where your money will come from while you're living on the road. In many cases, you may need to supplement any savings or savings plans with flexible employment.


Jobs that allow you to work online or on a freelance basis are often the most suited for this lifestyle, but you can also consider alternative forms of income like craft fairs and bartering.
Check around with others who live the RV lifestyle and determine what your options are. There are also online services dedicated to pairing employers with traveling workers.

, It's a good idea to estimate your expenses before venturing out and stick to a budget after you've begun. To determine your average monthly expenses, calculate what you currently spend each month, subtract the cost of living in a fixed home, and add the cost of living in an RV.While costs vary, expect to spend between $1,500 and $3,000 per month while living in an RV.
Costs you won't need to worry about include property taxes, mortgages, rent, and certain utilities.
Extra costs you will need to include include the cost of the RV itself, the RV insurance, and certain camping costs.
Your daily living costs will remain fairly consistent. This includes the cost of food, entertainment, and health insurance.

, You won't be able to park anywhere and everywhere, but thankfully, there are many areas where you can legally park for free.You can usually park and camp for free on public land as long as it is zoned for that purpose. Some districts will require you to choose a site with an established campfire ring, and other restrictions may apply. Check with the ranger's office in each district for more specific guidelines.
Some commercial parking lots and truck stops will allow you to park for free overnight, but you'll usually need to clear out after a day or two.
You can also search for campgrounds and RV parks, but you may need to pay some fee for using these services.
If you have pets (especially dogs), you also need to make sure that the places you choose to stop allow you to bring pets.

, When you stop somewhere, make sure that you're close enough to a town that will give you access to the necessary facilities required for meeting meet your daily needs.


At minimum, you'll need to stop near towns that have a grocery store and various restaurants. If you do not have laundry facilities in your RV, you will also need to locate nearby laundromats.

, Even if you don't need a second vehicle to tow your RV, you should still maintain one in the event that your RV falls into temporary or permanent disrepair.


You can tow your car or keep it in a central, easily accessible location.
Cars are more fuel-efficient than RVs, so having your car with you will allow you to take more scenic drives and make it easier to perform errands.
Having a car also gives you some form of alternate transportation if your RV needs to go in for service.

Locate an open space and drive two to three spaces beyond the intended parking spot.,
Examine your surroundings for pedestrians and other vehicles.,
Put your car in reverse and slowly move backwards as you turn the wheel.,
Straighten the wheel and back into the spot.,
Straighten your SUV if needed.",How to 90 Degree Park Large SUVs1," Backing into a parking space is always the safest method of parking. When you back into a parking space, you have the opportunity to assess the open spot as you drive past it. This allows you to see if there are any obstructions within the spot or if vehicles are parked too close to the spot’s boundary lines. Lastly, when it is time to leave, you can pull out of the spot rather than backing out of the spot.


As you search for an open spot, your SUV should remain approximately 7 to 8 feet away from parked vehicles.
When you see an open spot, turn on your turn signal to notify other drivers of your intention to park.
As you drive past the spot, examine the parking space. If the space is safe and large enough for your SUV to fit within, drive two to three spaces beyond the intended bay. SUVs come in a variety of sizes. Adjust the distance away from the space and the parked cars as needed.;
, Before you back into the spot, you must make sure your surroundings are clear. Use your mirrors and windows to look around your SUV. Wait for any pedestrians, cyclists, or oncoming vehicles to pass you. If there is a vehicle behind your car, make sure you can safely maneuver into the space. If the other driver is not paying attention, find a different parking spot., Once your surroundings are clear, prepare to back into the space. Put your SUV in reverse. Turn in your seat to look out the back window and check your mirrors.


If your surroundings are still clear, begin to drive your SUV backwards slowly while turning the wheel fully towards the direction of the space. Turn the wheel fully to the right if the space is on your right; turn the wheel fully to the left if the space is on your left.
As move backwards, the lines of the open parking space will appear in your side mirrors. Use the lines to guide you into the space. The line nearest you is “Line A” and the line furthest from you is “Line B.” Repeatedly glance at the side mirror closest to the space until Line A appears in it. As the SUV rounds into the space, Line B will appear in the other side mirror.
Continue to check your side mirrors to monitor your distance from each line. You should be equidistant from each line.
The slower you execute this, the easier and safer the process will be., When Line A and Line B appear parallel in your side mirrors, pause for a moment. Straighten your wheel by turning it 1 ½ times. Once your tires are straight, continue to back into the space until your rear bumper nears the concrete barrier or the car behind you. Put the vehicle in park, exit the SUV, and lock it., If your SUV is too close to another car or crooked, correct the parking job before exiting your vehicle. Leaving your vehicle too close to another car may result in damages.


Shift your car from reverse to drive.
Look to your right and left to check for pedestrians and other cars. Once it is clear, pull forward away from the object your SUV is too close to.
Continue to move forward until your SUV is centered and straight. Turn the wheel so that your tires are straight.
Shift your SUV into reverse.
Use your rearview mirror as you drive backwards into the space.
Put your vehicle in park and exit the SUV."

Locate an open parking space and position your car to pull into the empty spot.,
Turn your wheel and slowly drive into the space.,
Straighten your wheel and put your SUV in park.,
Straighten your SUV if needed.",How to 90 Degree Park Large SUVs2," As you search for an open parking space, keep your SUV approximately 7 to 8 feet away from parked vehicles. When you locate an empty bay that is large enough for your vehicle, slow down and signal your intention to park. When your side mirrors reach the center of the space immediately next to the space you intend to park in, come to a complete stop.


If there is a parked car in the space immediately next to the space you intend to park in, align your side mirrors with the center of the vehicle’s license plate., Quickly turn your steering wheel 2 ½ times towards the direction of the space. If the space is on your right, turn the wheel to the right; if the space is on your left, turn the wheel to the left. When your surroundings are clear, proceed forwards into the open space. When your side mirrors reach those of the cars parked next to you, press the brake pedal., To straighten your tires, turn your steering wheel 1 ½ times in the opposite direction—if you initially turned the wheel to your left, turn it 1 ½ times to the right; if you initially turned the wheel to your right, turn it 1 ½ times to the left. Put your SUV in park, exit your vehicle, and lock it., If your SUV is not straight, correct your parking job before leaving your vehicle. Exiting your SUV when it is too close to another car may result in damages.


Shift your car from drive to reverse.
Turn in your seat and use your mirrors to check for pedestrians and other vehicles. Once it is clear, pull out of the space away from the object your SUV is too close to.
Continue to move backwards until your SUV is centered and straight.
Shift your SUV into drive and turn the wheel so that your tires are straight.
Use your side mirrors as you pull forwards into the space.
Put your vehicle in park and exit the SUV."
"
Use your SUV’s backup camera.,
Park further away from you final destination.,
Avoid backing out of spaces.,
Check your mirrors frequently.",How to 90 Degree Park Large SUVs3," Many SUVs are equipped with backup cameras. While this technology allows drivers to see what is behind their vehicles, it should always be used in combination with your side and rearview mirrors. You can use this feature when you are backing into a parking space, straightening your forward 90-degree parking job, or backing out of a parking space. To activate this feature, shift your vehicle into reverse. As you park, straighten, or leave a space, use the monitor and your mirrors to safely execute the task.


The process of parking, straightening, and leaving a parking space does not change with the use of the backup camera., SUVs are challenging to park. When the space you intend to park in is flanked on each side by other vehicles, the challenge increases. Minimize your risk of damaging other vehicles and your SUV by parking on the outskirts of lots or the top floors of a structures..

, Backing out of a parking spot in an SUV is very difficult—SUVs have several blind spots. It is always safer to pull out of a spot because you can clearly see oncoming traffic, pedestrians, and other potential obstacles. When you have the option, always back into a parking space or pull through a parking space..

, Like all cars, SUVs have blind spots. Unlike small vehicles, however, an SUV’s blind spots are much larger. When parking, use your mirrors to compensate for your SUV’s blind spots."

Locate the blue book.,
Visit the NADA website.,
Provide the requested information.,
Receive your report.,
Understand the limitations of the book value.",How to Calculate the Value of a Mobile Home1," In the United States, the NADA Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide is the “blue book” used to determine the value of mobile homes.Go to your local library and see if there is a copy.


Look in the book for your type of manufactured home, and then follow the step-by-step guide for calculating the retail book value. Your calculation will depend in part on the condition of the mobile home.;
, Alternately, you can submit an online request for a value report at the NADA website. Go here: http://www.nadaguides.com/FAQ/manufactured-home-value-reports#q21. However, you must pay in order to get a report.


A Basic Used Home Value Report will cost $26. You can use this report if there are no unique features to your mobile home.
A Professional Used Home Value Report will cost $50. This report will give you a more in-depth analysis and accurate estimate of the home’s value.A New Home Price Report will cost $35.

, The NADA guide will estimate the value of your home based on the following factors:year the home was manufactured
manufacturer
size of the home (width and length)
where you are located (state and region)
condition of the home
other features, such as granite countertops, hardwood floors, garages, etc.

, After submitting your online request, you will instantly receive your report. Click on the “View Your Report” button, which is located on your payment confirmation page.You can print off your report or save it.

, The book value does not take into account the value of your land, which is often more valuable than your mobile home.For this reason, you should also do your own research if your mobile home is fixed to a piece of property.

, There should be either one or three valves.

, Depending on whether you have a one valve system or a three valve system, here is what to do next:


One Valve System: Turn the valve to the vertical position. This valve should be on the lower line connected to the water heater.
Three Valve System: Turn the top and bottom valves to the closed position (usually perpendicular to the line). Then turn the middle valve to the open position (usually parallel to the line).

Research comparable sales in your neighborhood.,
Assess the condition of the home's interior.,
Inspect the outside of the home.,
Identify features that add value.,
Ask a real estate agent for an analysis.,
Look at your property tax statement.",How to Calculate the Value of a Mobile Home2," Each local real estate market is different, and the book value cannot account for whether your local market is hot or not. Make sure to look at how much comparable mobile homes have sold in your area.You can find the sale price at your county recorder’s office or by looking at websites such as Zillow.The mobile homes need to be comparable in terms of size, age, general condition, and the amount of land.
You are unlikely to find an exact match, but you don’t need an exact match. Find mobile homes around the same age as yours and about the same size.
Sales also need to be recent. The market was different four years ago than it is today.

, The overall condition of the mobile home will impact its value. Visit the mobile home and try to inspect the inside. The more repairs you need to make, the less value the home has. Pay attention to the following factors:Roof. Look for signs of a leaky roof inside the mobile home. In particular, water damage should show on the ceiling or walls.
Walls. Check the stability of the walls and whether there is any mold.
Flooring. Look for holes or soft spots on floors. Also check whether the floor is uneven.
Plumbing. Some water leaks may be caused by leaks in the plumbing. Also check the water pressure.
Electricity. Check outlets and turn on light switches to see if the electricity works.

, Repairs often have to be made to the outside of the mobile home. Walk around and assess the following:Roof. Don't rely solely on the absence of water marks inside. Instead, check the exterior of the roof by walking on it and looking for soft spots, holes, or missing shingles.
Siding. Check whether siding is damaged, rotting, or dented. Also assess the overall aesthetic quality. Ugly siding can reduce the value of the home.
Underside. Definitely check the underside to see how stable it is. If necessary, remove some pieces of skirting and use a flashlight. Check for insulation hanging down or junk and debris strewn all over the place. Also check whether animals are living under the home.

, Some features might increase the value of your mobile home. You should identify anything that would make your home desirable, including the following:


Quality of the neighborhood. For example, you might be in a well-maintained neighborhood that isn’t overcrowded. If so, your home’s value should increase.
Proximity to services. Your home’s value will also increase if you are near hospitals, schools, or a transportation hub.Granite countertops or new appliances. Buyers might value these features and pay more for them.

, A real estate agent might be willing to provide you with a comparative market analysis (CMA) for free.Find agents in your phone book or ask someone you know for a referral.

, You are assessed property taxes based on the value of your home. Find your property tax statement and find out how much the appraiser has valued the mobile home.Property tax records are also public, so you can find out this information about another home in your area. Visit the tax assessor’s office.

Find an appraiser.,
Ask about the appraiser’s knowledge of mobile homes.,
Meet with the appraiser.,
Analyze the appraisal report.",How to Calculate the Value of a Mobile Home3," Look for someone who is certified or has a state license.These are signs of sufficient training and skill. You can find an appraiser in the following places:


Obtain a referral from a state appraisal board. Type “your state” and “appraisal board” into your favorite search engine. Check to see if your state board has a directory you can search.
Search the directory of an accreditation society, such as the American Society of Appraisers.
Contact a real estate agent for a referral to someone who is qualified.

, Mobile homes can present many challenges to appraisers who do not have sufficient experience. Ask appraisers whether they have a certification to appraise mobile homes or whether they have ever taken a course on manufactured home appraisals.Keep researching appraisers until you find one sufficiently knowledgeable about mobile homes.

, You should meet the appraiser at the mobile home. They may have questions about the neighborhood or the property.Answer them as completely and honestly as you can.


The appraiser also needs space to perform the appraisal, so don’t hover. Give them enough space to do their job properly.
A typical appraisal takes a few hours and costs around $300-400., When you receive the report, you should study it closely. You’ll want to make sure that the appraiser used appropriate homes for comparison purposes.


Also check whether the appraiser properly valued features that can add value to your mobile home, such as location to public transportation or proximity to a good school district.If you disagree with something in the appraisal report, bring it to the appraiser’s attention. Write a letter laying out what you think the appraiser overlooked.

Also large, open parking lots can be used for tricks. Make sure there aren't any rules against skating or scooters!


If you’re shy, stick to your driveway and garage till you feel comfortable.;
, Some might poke fun if you wear knee and elbow pads, but your joints are worth it! Always wear a helmet. You are most prone to injury when you first practice more complex tricks like the 180.


Don’t increase your chances for needing knee surgery!

, Push yourself in quick bursts to reach a fast speed. This will help you build enough momentum to get ""air"".


Gauge how fast you can reach on the scooter and aim for a few notches below this speed.

, This means bending your knees and getting as low as possible while remaining balanced. Center your weight below your torso.


If this feels uncomfortable at first, practice riding around in this crouched position.

, Push off the ground by extending yourself up, in a jumping motion, while holding onto the handle bars. Once you're in the air, pull the scooter in towards yourself.


Make sure that both wheels are at least half a foot off the ground; otherwise, one of the wheels might catch the pavement as you perform the 180., Shift the top half of your body, beginning with your head, in the direction that you want to do the 180. You can either go left (backside) or to the right (frontside). Rotate a full 180, or until you are facing the opposite direction.


When you turn your head/upper body, the rest of your body and scooter will follow.

Understand the faux 180.,
Practice stationary.,
Gain momentum.,
Hop off and spin.,
Land the trick.",How to 180 on a Scooter3," If you are a little scared of landing a traditional 180, there is a safer version. During a faux 180 your feet leave the scooter momentarily while the scooter performs a 180. This is inspired by old school skateboarding tricks where they’d incorporate one foot on the pavement.

, You will want to get comfortable whipping your scooter in a 180. While off your scooter, spin the handle bars around so the scooter does a 180. Once you get a feel for the movement required by your hands, try incorporating your body.


Once the scooter completes a 180, hop on with your feet right before the scooter hits the surface., Once you’ve practiced in your garage a few times, it’s time to bring it to the streets. You don’t need to go too fast to pull this one off. Just gain a casual speed.

, Try to hop off with one foot while spinning the handlebar in a 180 motion. The best look is when one foot is on the ground, one foot in the air, and the scooter operating a 180 spin.


For starting out, you can hop off with both feet.

, Once the scooter completes the 180, try to hop back onto the scooter while it’s still in the air. This way you and the scooter land the 180 at the same time."

Wrap a metal pail with parchment paper or freezer paper to serve as the mold for your basket, then set it aside.You can use a pail with tapering sides, but make sure that the widest part is at the rim.,
Get some ⅜-inch (0.95-centimeter) thick cotton piping cord.,
Fold over one end of your rope, and glue it in place.,
Start wrapping the rope around itself to create a flat disk, gluing it all around.Apply 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hot glue, then press the rope into it.,
Keep wrapping the rope until the disk is one coil larger than the base of your pail.,
Place the pail on top of the rope disk, then start building the walls of your basket.,
Continue building the walls of your basket until it is as tall as you'd like it to be.,
Finish the end.,
Consider adding some leather handles.",How to Make a Rope Basket1," If your pail is wider at the bottom, you won't be able to pull it out when you are done.


Secure the paper to the pail with tape to keep it steady, if necessary.;
, You will need about 10 to 15 yards (9.14 to 13.72 meters) to make one basket. It is always better to have too much cording than too little; joining cording on baskets is difficult., Draw a ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) long line of hot glue along the end of your rope. Immediately fold the end over onto the rest of the rope. This ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) stub will serve as the foundation for your basket.

, Don't squeeze out too much hot glue at once, or it will set before you can press the rope into it, and the bond won't be as strong.

, From time to time, place the rope disk against the bottom of your pail to measure it. Once the disk is the same width as the base, glue down another coil of rope, then stop. You are now ready to build up the walls of your basket.

, Draw a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) line of hot glue on your rope. Instead of pressing it down onto the side edge of the disk, press it down onto the top edge.Keep gluing the rope down, inch by inch (2.54 centimeters) until you have completed your first row.

, You can make your basket the same height as your pail or a little bit shorter. Be sure to wrap the rope tightly around the pail., When your basket is the height you want, cut your rope down until it is 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) long. Fold the last inch (2.54 centimeters) under itself, and glue it in place. Next, hot glue the remaining 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to the body of the basket.

, Cut two 10-inch (25.4-centimeter) long strips of leather.They can be as wide as you'd like them to be, but something around 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) would be ideal. You can hot glue the handles to the sides of the basket, or stitch them on using jute cord for a rustic touch.You can also attach them with rivets by doing the following:Use a leather punch to punch a hole into the end of each handle.
Place a rivet into each hole.
Position the rivets against the sides of the basket. Make sure that the rivets go through the cording.
Hammer the rivets in place from inside the basket.
Secure the handles with more hot glue, if needed.

Turn the disk so that it is perpendicular to the sewing machine, and start building up the sides of the basket.,
Start shaping the first handle.,
Add the second handle.,
Finish the basket.",How to Make a Rope Basket2," It is usually found in spools online. A 200-foot (60.96-meter) spool will give your three medium-sized baskets.Because it is hard to join two pieces of rope together, it is better to have too much rope than not enough.

, Fold the end of the rope under itself, then roll it in a spiral to form a small disk that is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) across. This will create the foundation of your basket., Choose the largest stitch length possible on your sewing machine, then set the stitch to a zigzag. Sew straight across the disk, rotate it 90 degrees, then sew back across it, forming an X., Turn the disk so that the rest of the of the rope is in front of the sewing machine. Hold the rope against the side of the disk, then slide the disk under the presser foot. Make sure that the center of the foot is in the groove between the two coils.You can use a thread color that matches your rope, or you can use a contrasting color to make it look more interesting.

, The needle should be going back and forth across the groove, catching onto both coils of rope. This is what will hold the basket together. Keep going until the basket is the width you want it to be.


Avoid making your basket too wide using this method. The wider it is, the more difficult it will be to sew. Something around 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) across would be ideal., Grab hold of the disk, and turn it so that it is resting vertically against the side of the sewing machine. Continue sewing your way across the coils, using the same zigzag stitch as before, until your basket it the height you want it to be.Consider changing the color of your thread every couple of rows for an interesting, banded effect.At this point, your basket is just about complete. You can click here to learn how to finish your basket, or you can keep reading to learn how to add handles.

, When your basket is the height you want it to be, stop sewing, and backstitch back and forth a few times. Cut the thread and tie it off. Tug the rope up to loosen it and create a loop. Move forward a few inches/centimeters, and start sewing again; remember to backstitch a few times before you continue sewing around the basket.Make sure that the loop you make is big enough for you to slip your hand through.

, Keep sewing your basket as you did previously until you are directly across from the first handle. Backstitch a few times, then cut and tie the thread. Pull the rope up, move forward a few inches, and start sewing again. Once again, backstitch a few times at your new starting point.


When you get to the start of the first handle, you can choose to finish your basket. You can also keep sewing across the handles for 1 to 2 more rows to make them thicker and stronger.


, Cut the rope down to 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Tuck it into the basket, and backstitch across it a few times. Cut the thread off, and tie it into a tight knot.

Continue building the sides of your basket using the two stitches from before.,
Cut and bind off your rope.,
Finish the basket.",How to Make a Rope Basket3," The type of rope you work with does not matter, but since you will be handling it a lot, it might be a good idea to work with something that is soft so that your fingers don't feel sore by the end. Macramé or 100% rope would work best, however., You will be changing your floss often, so it does not matter how long it is. You can make it as long or as short as you want, so long as you can work without it getting tangled.Something around 24 inches (60.96) would be ideal, however.You can use the same color of embroidery floss throughout the project, or you can use different colors to create a more interesting looking basket.

, Take your rope, and fold the end under itself. Twist the rope into a spiral until you have a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide disk. This will be the foundation for your basket.

, Push the needle through the side of your coiled disk, and pull it out the other side. Give the thread a tug until the knot bumps up against the disk. Turn the disk 90 degrees, and push the needle back through the disk, forming an X. This will hold the foundation of your basket together., Bring your needle across two coils, then push it down through the space between them. Pull the needle out through the back of your work, and bring it back up to the top of your disk., Bring your needle across one coil. Bring it just past the gap between the two coils, and push it through the edge of the second coil. Pull the needle out through the back of your disk, and bring it back to the top of your work., Work in a spiral around the disk. The stitches can be as close together or as far apart as you want them to be. Something around ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) would be ideal, however.


When you run out of floss, push the needle under the stitch, through a coil, and knot the floss to the previous stitch. Pass the needle and floss through a few stitches, then cut the floss.
To start a new thread: thread your needle and tie a knot at the end of the floss. Pass it through the same stitches, but going forward this time. When you are back where you left off, continue sewing, the same as before.

, Previously, you held the rope against the side edge of the disk. Now, move the rope so that it is on the top edge of the disk. Wrap the thread around both coils: the top one that you are feeding onto your basket, and the one attached to the disk. Do this for one row.Add an element of design to your basket by wrapping the floss around the rope a few times to create a colored band. These bands can be as thick as you want them to be. Be sure to go back and sew the coils together as you normally would, however.

, Wrap your thread over two coils, then over one coil and through the coil just beneath it.If you need to, place a large bowl inside the basket while you build up the walls. This will help you shape the basket., Find the spot where you first started building up the wall of your basket. Continue sewing your basket until you reach that spot, then cut the rope. Wrap the embroidery thread around the end of the rope tightly until you have a colored band that is about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) thick. This will not only add an element of design to your basket, but also keep the rope from fraying., Sew the end of the rope to the basket using the same technique as you did for the body of the basket. Wrap your floss around the top of your rope, and then push the needle under the coil just beneath it. Go back over the top of your rope, then through the coil below it. Tie the floss to the stitch next to it, then push the needle between two coils of rope, hiding the floss between them. Cut the floss, and tuck the end into the ropes."

",How to Start a Successful Craft Business," It's much easier to run a business with two people than with one. Choose someone who can also craft and who has a strong work ethic. Having more than one extra person, however, can make the work load hard to navigate and may make it easier to disagree on things.;
, A good business has a wide variety of products to offer. You should start with no less than three different items. When choosing what you want to sell, it is important that you know how to make the items, and how to make them well. How do you know if you're making an item well? If you make a product well, you can produce several identical products in a row without making a mistake. Even though you may be selling three different items, you should start by picking just one to ""specialize"" in.

, Take some time to travel to different craft fairs and exhibitions to see what all the other business owners are selling. The less amount of people selling, the more business you'll get! Let's say you were considering the demand for a memory board. You would ask yourself these questions: Would I buy a memory board from someone else?, Would my friends buy a memory board?, Have memory boards been selling in stores lately?, and Have I seen many people buying memory boards lately?. If the answer to three or more of these questions is yes, the item is in high demand. When considering the difficulty of an item, it is important that the item is somewhat difficult to make. This way, you can be sure that not many other people will be able to master your craft and potentially sell it. However, if the item is too difficult for you to be able to produce quickly, you may not be able to support the demand for the product.

, If you don't have everything you need at home, it's time to go on a shopping spree with your partner. In addition to any supplies that you normally need for your craft, there are a few other necessities needed to start seriously crafting. (See ""Things You'll Need"")You and your partner should split the cost of the supplies. Each penny you spend should be documented and kept safe. This will make certain that you and your partner are equally recompensed for your spending. It will also make it possible for you to determine your profit.

, You need to start locally with a few fairs and events. Don't sign up for more than three events at a time, and never schedule two sales that will occur within a week of a each other.

, If your business is truly destined for success, there will be some customers that are addicted to your crafts! By starting an outreach program, you'll make it possible for them to buy customized crafts. Simply type and print fifty or so papers with blanks for your customers' names, addresses, the style of the product they want, etc. Leave the papers on your stand next to a few pens and a box for turn-ins.

, If you have a business that sells crocheted potholders, ask a yarn store if they'd be willing to take out some advertisements for money. If they agree, print out around twenty fliers advertising their business and encourage customers to take one when they purchase items. This is a quick and easy way to make some additional money, and help out a local business.

, You will need a table of two to display your items on, tablecloths, a calculator, a cash box, and some sort of awning to cover you.

In candles, making container candles is probably the simplest, but you can also make mold candles or taper candles., Waxes come in several main groups. Which group you choose is mostly based on preference.


One group is paraffin, which is a by-product of petroleum. You can find it in a variety of melting points, depending on what type of candles you are making. For instance, you need a higher melting point for tapers than you do for container candles.Another type of wax is beeswax. Beeswax is a product that bees make, so it has a natural, light honey smell. Some people prefer this wax because it is all-natural, though others will mix beeswax with other waxes for their candles.A third category of waxes is vegetable waxes, where soy is probably the most popular. One benefit of soy wax is it is pure white, and it also doesn't shrink up when you pour it, which means you don't have to pour wax more than once. Bayberry wax is also in this category., One of the simplest ways to learn how to make candles is to take a class in your community. You may be able to find one with your local parks and recreation department or even at your local community college. However, you can also find a wide variety of tutorials online. In fact, you'll likely be able to find all you need to know online if that is your preference.You can also check out books from your local library about candle-making.

, Before you start selling, you need to take time to build up your skill. Try working a little bit each day on your business, starting with practicing a bit each day.

, When you're first starting your business, it can help to have a lawyer on your side. She can help you file the appropriate paperwork and ensure you have the correct licenses when you start your business.

, If you can't decide on a name at first, just pick anything. You are allowed to do business under a different name if you file it later as ""Doing business under."" In other words, if you don't like the name you choose, you can always change it later., If you intend to keep your business on a small scale, you have the main options of sole proprietorship and limited liability company (LLC). A sole proprietorship is intended for a one-person company, but you are personally responsible for all the debts of the company. On the upside, it is easier to file for a sole proprietorship than an LLC. In an LLC, you are more separated from the business, meaning you are not personally responsible for the debt if the company goes under. In other words, you don't have to give up your house to pay the debts of the company, unless you do something illegal.You'll file for these structures through your home state.Most states charge a fee for filing, though it's usually not too much.
A third option is a partnership, which generally acts as sole proprietorship spread among partners., This number identifies your business to the IRS. If you chose sole proprietorship, you don't absolutely need an EIN. However, it gives you a number to use for tax purposes that is not your Social Security Number, so it can be helpful.The easiest way to apply for an EIN is online on the IRS website. The form only takes a few minutes to fill out, and you get your number quickly. The process is free., Generally, if you own a small business without customers who visit your place of business, you can run it out of your home. However, you should always check with your city first to see what laws they have around home businesses. For instance, the city may not allow your business to run out of your garage.Of course, you can also choose to start your business out of a storefront. In that case, you'll need to scout a location. In addition, buying or renting a space is a significant investment., Your city may require you to have certain permits to run your business. The easiest way to find out is simply to ask at your city clerk office, which should be able to tell you what you need., You can set up a business account with any bank, though it may make it easier to do it through a bank you already frequent. A business account helps you keep personal purchases separate from business purchases., That is, make sure you are tracking what you spend and what you make. You don't necessarily need expensive software to keep track of it. You can do it in a spreadsheet, if you want., As a small business owner, you must pay your federal taxes in quarterly if you expect to pay in more than $1,000. It's similar to how your employer would withhold taxes for you, except now you must do it yourself.You make payments through the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System., You'll also need to pay state taxes, as well as the federal taxes. Generally, you pay company income taxes once a year, but you may need to pay in sales taxes more often, such as quarterly. Check with your state to see what it requires. You may even need to get a state identification number.In some states, you'll need a certificate of resale to collect sales taxes on products.Also, it may be easiest to hire an accountant to take care of both your state and federal taxes for you, as accountants will be better versed in what you will owe., You can design one yourself or hire a pro. A pro will have the experience to create a great logo you can use across many platforms. A logo is what represents your business to your customers, so it needs to be simple, interesting, and recognizable. Once you have a logo, you can use it to design labels for your candles and to create business cards., Most cities, even small ones, have local craft shows where you can sell your wares. Consider a wide variety of options. For instance, even food and wine fairs often have crafting vendors. Of course, you'll also need to pay for booth space to participate., You have a couple of options when you offer crafts in local stores. Some stores will buy your product outright and resell it. Others will only take a commission when your product sells.A third option is buying booth space in a craft store that sells local crafts.


The easiest stores to get into are ones that offer booth space, as you pay for the space. However, it's not always easy to make your booth space back.
When approaching stores with your wares, have pictures with you, as well as samples. Be professional by being polite and dressing up. In addition, always call first to see when an appropriate time to come in would be. Some stores prefer that you provide photos online., Craft websites are becoming more and more popular. Generally, you set up your own mini site through the larger site, creating a virtual store front. The website handles the transactions for you, and then you mail the product where it needs to go.The best parts of using a craft website is you don't have to maintain a website, and you've got traffic built in. However, you don't have as much control over design or policies.You can also build your own website, but that takes some technical know-how, especially if you want to add in a way to buy on the site.

, One of the best ways to market your product is through social media. Basically, you set up business accounts on major social media websites. You can then friend people or use hashtags to attract customers.It's important to engage with your customers and other people in the industry. If you just throw products at them, you're likely to turn customers off. However, if you build relationships, you'll be more likely to gain customers. That means offering value outside of your products (such as tutorials or funny content), talking with customers, and engaging with other people who are in the community.If you want people to promote your content, you should be promoting others, as well. When someone shares your picture, try sharing something in return.Share quality content. Quality content will get other people to share it as well. That means taking good pictures and being professional in everything you do., One way to help people find your product is to use keywords and hashtags to your advantage. When you're selling on a crafting website, you need to find the right keywords to help your product stand out. That means picking keywords that are unique to your product but that are also trendy. Think about what you would use to search for your product.The same can be said of hashtags. On certain social media sites, hashtags are used to group pictures and content. By using the right hashtags, you'll find customers who will connect to your product. For instance, if you make 100 percent pure beeswax candles, you can use the hashtag #purebeeswaxcandles to help others find you."

, After you have woven the thread around the entire circle, begin to pull the ends of the thread. This will begin to shape the circle of fabric into a pom pom shape.If you cannot pull in the fabric by pulling on the thread, then the stitches may be too tight. You may need to remove the thread and start over with more space between the stitches.
Make sure that you leave an opening at the top of the pom pom. You still need to fill it with stuffing before you close it.

, You can use nylon stuffing, cotton balls, or scrap fabric to stuff your pom pom. Place the stuffing in the center of the pom pom.Do not overfill the pom pom. Add just enough to give it a round shape.

, When you are satisfied with the level of stuffing in your pom pom, pull the thread to tighten it, and then tie the ends of the thread together. Tie a few knots to ensure that your pom pom will be secure.After you finish tying the knots, your pom pom is ready to use!

Sew opening closed.",How to Create a Faux Fur Pom Pom2," To make a large pom pom, cut out two circles in the same size. You can make the circles any size that you like. Using two 4 inch (10.2 cm) circles will result in a pom pom that is about the size of a fist. If you want your pom pom to be larger, then cut larger circles.Use a plate, container lid, or some other kind of circular object as a guide when you are cutting out the circles.

, The right sides are the sides of the fabric with print on them, or in this case, with fur on them. Line up the two circles with the fur sides facing each other.You may even want to pin the circles together to keep them lined up while you sew the edges together.

, Use a sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the edges of the circles, but leave about a 2 inch (5.1 cm) gap to flip the pom poms inside out and to insert your stuffing. Using a sewing machine will create a tight stitch to keep the stuffing inside of your fur pom poms. However, you can also hand sew the edges of the circles together if you do not have a sewing machine.Remove the pins as you sew.

, After sewing the edges together, use the gap that you left to turn the fabric inside out. This will put the fur side of your faux fur fabric to the outside.If the gap is too small to pull the fabric through, use a seam ripper or scissors to cut a few of the stitches and widen the gap.

, When the fur is on the outside again, fill the pom pom with nylon stuffing, cotton balls, or scrap fabric.You do not need to overstuff the pom pom. Use just enough stuffing to give the pom pom its round shape., When you are happy with the stuffing level of your pom pom, sew the gap closed to finish it.

Create a Perler bowl.",How to Use Perler Beads," You'll need a flat, stable area to make your Perler bead design. The pegboard you'll be using for your beads has very small pegs, so an unlevel surface may cause the beads to fall off. In all, for your Perler beading project, you'll need:


A Perler pegboard
An iron
Parchment paper
Perler Beads;
, There are many shapes you can choose from. You could create a dog, a fish, a hexagon, a shoe and so on. Perler makes many different shapes of pegboards, but you could also use a pattern and a clear Perler pegboard.


If you have a larger design in mind, you could use large, interlocking Perler pegboards. These can be clipped together, giving you room to create.
The shape of Perler beads will give the image you are trying to make a pixelated look. This makes Perler beads perfect for imitating old school video games. Many of these patterns can be found for free online.There are many online sites that offer free Perler patterns, but you can purchase official patterns from the Perler online store as well. Patterns can be downloaded to your personal computer, printed, slid under a clear mat, and used to guide your Perler art., Perler beads, being rather tiny, can be elusive in the container. So you don't have to struggle digging out a color from your supply while beading, you may want to separate the colors you plan on using into several small bowls or ramekins.


Some designs call for a specific number of beads to be used.When following a design like this, you may want to gather a few extra beads in each color, just in case you lose one while beading.

, If you are following a shaped pegboard, like a pegboard shaped like a cat for example, you should slip the beads onto the raised pegs in the arrangement you desire. If you are using a clear, square shaped pegboard, you should slide a pattern underneath before beading, or you could create a freeform design of your own making.


When using a pattern beneath your pegboard, it's important to make sure the pattern is properly aligned with the pegs. Each bead represented by the pattern should center around a peg.
You might make use of a realistic color scheme, or you might choose wacky colors to give your creation character. Your imagination's the limit!
Due to the fact that the pegs of your Perler pegboard are so small, it's very easy for you to jostle the board and knock your beads loose. To prevent this, you may want to lay a non-slip craft mat beneath your beading project.
You can put your Perler beads onto the pegs in any way that works best for you, but you may want to consider working from the bottom up or top down. Working from the outside in can crowd the empty pegs on the inside of the board, which may cause you to accidentally knock beads off of pegs., Take your parchment paper, which is also sometimes called ironing paper, and place it over the beads on the pegboard. You should be careful when doing this so that you don't accidentally knock any beads out of place. Heat a dry iron to a medium setting, then slowly run it in a circular motion over the parchment paper.You'll have to continue this for about 10 seconds for the beads to stick together.


The amount of time this takes can vary depending on factors like the kind of iron you are using. You may want to remove your iron at intervals and check your design every five seconds. Applying too much heat could turn your design into a Perler pancake!
If you have an iron with a steam function, you should be sure this is turned off when heating your beads. Hot steam could affect the outcome of your design.
Wax paper can be used when heating your Perler beads, but this can leave a waxy residue on the finished product. Parchment paper, on the other hand, will not., After allowing a little while for the beads and board to cool, you should flip your peg board over. This will make the beads fall off the board and expose the un-heated side of your beads.


Place the parchment paper over your beads, and heat the beads in the same fashion you did before. Use medium heat, a dry iron, and circular motions for about 10 seconds., Take the parchment paper by one corner and peel it away from the pegboard. Your beads will be quite warm right after you finish ironing, so you should allow a few minutes to cool before handling your Perler art.Your Perler bead design is now ready to show off! Remove it from the pegboard and show your friends the design you have created.

, This can give your art a magical appearance and is a useful touch when making ponies, unicorns, or fairies. Simply take some fine glitter and sprinkle it on your beaded pegboard before applying your heat. After you're done heating, your finished product will sparkle!


You could also purchase Perler beads that already have glitter mixed in with the bead. These can be used as normal, and create a great effect., Layer parchment paper on a cookie sheet and place metal, oven-safe cookie cutters on the paper. Then, add Perler beads to your cookie cutters. You could choose to fill your cookie cutters with a single color or you could even mix several colors together. Be sure you don't fill your cookie cutters to the top; this could result in your beads spilling over the rim of the cookie cutter.


To melt your beads, you should preheat your oven to 400°. When it's finished preheating, bake the Perler beads for 10 minutes. After that, remove your beads, allow time for the beads, pan, and cookie cutters to cool.
Once cool, you can pop your Perler beads free of your cookie cutters. The beads will be melted in the shape of your cookie cutter.
There should be space for you to thread a small string through the gaps in your fused Perler beads. Do so and tie the ends of the string together to complete your ornament.
You should check your beads while baking. Some ovens may run a little hotter or colder than others, meaning you might have to add or subtract from your bead bake time., This design will be easiest on a medium sized, square shaped beading mat. On your mat, lay out two separate rows of Perler beads three across. Then lay out three separate H shapes on your mat, with the sides each being three beads long. The connector piece in the middle of the H will be a single bead. Each of these should be separated by at least one empty row of pegs.


Place parchment paper atop your beads and lightly apply heat. For this design to work best, you'll need your beads to be as lightly fused together as possible. Flip the mat and apply light head in the same fashion to the opposite side.
Allow the beads to cool, then build your cube by stacking your H shaped pieces atop each other. Snap your three bead long pieces into the empty spots in the middle of the stacked H. The size of the beads should create a close fit between the pieces. This will hold the design together by friction. Your cube is done!
If your beads aren't fitting together tightly enough to maintain the shape of your cube, you may need to use some glue. A dab of hot glue on the pieces oriented toward the inside of the cube should do the trick., Take an oven safe glass bowl and pour Perler beads into it. Arrange your beads so a thin layer is formed that climbs up the sides of the bowl. Preheat your oven to 350°, and when it is ready, insert your bowl into the oven.


After 15 minutes, remove the bowl from the oven. Your beads should now be melted into the shape of the bowl. Allow time to cool, then remove your Perler bowl.
Keep an eye on your Perler beads while baking. Baking too long could melt your Perler bowl into a puddle."

Sell in a brick-and-mortar store.",How to Start a Soap Making Business," Before you can succeed at selling soap, you must become an expert at making it, and refine the technique and formulae you want to use. There are two main methods for making soap, the hot process and the cold process.The cold process of making soap is the most common method. It involves mixing an alkali (usually lye) with fats or oils. Once mixed and formed into shape, it can take weeks for the soap to cure.
The hot process of making soap requires you to cook the soap. This method requires no cure time, and can make it easier to add scents and colors. However, it is more difficult to work with and mold hot process soap.
If you are new to soap making, consider taking a class in your area. Check with local crafts organizations, stores, and soap makers to see what opportunities are available.;
, Basic soap making only requires a few ingredients, but a wide variety of types of soap can be make by tweaking the formula.If you want to create a product that stands out, experiment with ingredients like scents, colors, and moisturizers until you create a soap that you think is unique and high-quality.

, Soap making requires a few dedicated tools, and a space to work in (whether just your kitchen, or a full shop). As your soap making operation grows, you might purchase additional equipment, but to start out you will at least need:A blender
A microwave
Molds
A mixing kettle
Labelers
Wrappers

, You’ll want to set yourself apart from the competition, and create a product that consumers really want. Think about who you want to buy your soaps, and what kind of niche your products will fill.For example, you might create soaps that are entirely free of any animal by-products for those consumers who care about animal rights, or soaps that are made using only all-natural ingredients for consumers who care about “green” and healthy living.Think about:


Creating a unique and memorable company nameUsing specially designed shapes
Embossing the soap with letters or other forms
Wrapping the soap in special papers or ribbons
Creating a logo for your company

, If you want to make soaps on a consistent scale, you will need a steady supply of oils, fats, scents, colors, wrappers, etc. You can go out and purchase all of these things yourself, but to save time and money you can order from suppliers that can ship the materials to you. Look for companies that can supply you with:


OilsMoldsScents and colors
Equipment, When you are ready to get your business off the ground, it is a good idea to talk to an accountant, a tax advisor, and an attorney for assistance with the legal and financial aspects of starting a business.While working with these professionals takes time and money, they can make the process easier, and help you avoid costly mistakes later on.


Whether or not you are working with a professional accountant, learn how to use small business accounting software such as Quickbooks.These programs can be a tremendous help in keeping up with inventory, sales, bills, and orders.

, To legally start a soap making business, you will have to formally incorporate a company. The exact requirements for doing so will vary depending on your location.


The Small Business Administration can offer lots of assistance with setting up your business, including finding loans and investors, filling out required forms, getting insurance, meeting tax requirements, etc.You should also contact your area’s local development board or small business administration about local support for setting up your business.
If you are planning on hiring other employees, contact the IRS about getting an Employer Identification Number (EIN) for tax purposes., You’ll want to have enough soap on hand to keep up with your orders. You don’t want to have orders coming in and no soap to supply, but on the other hand, you don’t want to invest money in making soaps that aren’t selling. When you are just starting out, it might pay to be a little conservative, but keep good track of your sales so that you can keep the proper inventory of soap around.


Label and package your stock so that it is ready to ship or sell.
Follow any labeling regulations in effect in your area. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that you list all ingredients of a soap on its label., For instance, you might price luxury soaps higher than those meant for everyday use. Research what competitors charge for soaps in your area, and set prices that are higher or lower, depending on your sales tactics.


Consider offering specials, like sales around holidays, reduced rates on bulk orders, and offers like “buy 2, get 1 free.”
Don’t set prices that are too low or too high. Try to set prices that will allow you to take care of your up-front costs (supplies, transportation, etc.), and hopefully leave a profit. If your sales increase, you can expect your profits to grow, but you don’t want to set prices so high at first that you don’t sell anything.

, To be successful at selling soap, you need to understand your market, and how to reach it.Spread the word about your soaps whenever and however you can, but target your primary market in particular. Common advertising possibilities include:


Word-of-mouth
Social media
Advertisements online and in traditional media
Business cards
Sales displays

, Handmade crafts like soaps can be easily sold at various markets and other events. Don't be afraid to travel outside of your local area either, as this can increase your potential customer base. Opportunities may include:Arts and crafts shows
Farmers markets
Home parties

, Many consumers shop and seek information online, even if they eventually buy products in person. If you want to succeed in the soap making business, be prepared to market your products online.This means not only making soaps available for sale via retailers like Etsy or your own website, but also promoting your product online through social media.


If you sell online, you will need to consider shipping costs and how to handle them. Consider whether you will have customers pay for some or all of the shipping themselves, and whether or not you will offer a variety of shipping options (standard delivery, express, overnight, etc.).

, You can approach existing stores about the possibility of selling yours soaps in them, or investigate opening your own physical store.If you do decide to open your own store, you will have to look for a location, negotiate rent and insurance, decide on business hours, and make other considerations.

"
"
Think whether you are willing and able to take the store seriously.,
Think of the location.,
A good option is to go on the Internet.,
Think of a name.,
Think of your budget.,
Think of your suppliers.,
Buy your inventory.

",How to Start a Fabric Store," Bear in mind that, if you are to go through with this, then it will be a business as well as a hobby.;
, Do you think that there is is a market for the fabric store in your area? Why? Is the reason that you want to start a fabric store because you saw one on the high street, and think that you should give it a go, or because you have always loved sewing. Are you in it for money or pleasure? Bear in mind that, even if you believe and your customers believe that your store is the best of the best, as it were, if there is another store on the high street, there will be a lot of competition.

, You can still have a name, and even a logo, but there is a much bigger market and on places such as EBay and Etsy, you have a dedicated audience, who are looking for something in particular instead of just browsing. Also, it is easier to use the Internet, because you do not need to pay for employees, hire, insurance, store or such a big stock.

, No matter whether you are online or on ground, you will need to have a catchy name, although less so online, as people usually don't tend to pass on eBay user's names. If your fabric is quite retro, call it something retro. If it is hippy, something hippy. If it is old fashioned, call it something old fashioned. Surely you get the idea?

, Bear in mind that if you are opening a shop front, then you will need a much larger budget than online. If you are opening it online, you will not need to pay for employees, hire, insurance or such a big stock, whereas If you are opening an actual shop then you will need to have a much larger budget. Also, if you are opening a shop, then you will always need a stock, whereas an online business can be operated with three items of fabric.

, If you are going to make your own fabric, you needn't read this bit, however if you aren't, then read on. You should probably go into a current fabric store and casually ask about suppliers in a friendly manner, or you could just google it. Or do both.

To start stringing a beaded necklace first acquire some basic parts.,
Start with a spring ring which is a kind of clasp.

,
Attach an extender which will be used with the spring ring.,
Then crimp beads.,
Finally, jump rings.,
To start the wired necklace, take the wire and pass it through the bottom part of the clam shell.

,
Next, put on a crimp bead.,
Next, pass the wire back through the same hole.,
Next, take the spring ring and place it onto the hook part.,
Now start putting on the beads.

,
There are two strings of wire, and make sure when putting on the beads to put both wires through the beads.,
To start stringing, first put on 2 seed beads, then put one 4mm Crystal clear Swarovski bead.

,
Repeat this same process a total of 21 times.,Add seed beads then 1 clear Swarovski, 2 seed beads then 1 clear Swarovski…

,
When putting the wires through the beads, make sure that both wires are going through the beads.

,
Now slide the beads down both wires.,
So now just repeat until there are a total of 21 clear Swarovski beads on the string.

,
Finish the process by putting on 2 seed beads.

,
Now move on to create the center piece of the necklace.

,
Change the color here and make the center part with 2 different colored Swarovski beads.,
Now put on the center piece of the necklace which is a Swarovski crystal in the shape of a flower.

,
To put the flower on the necklace, use both the round nose pliers and the chain nose pliers.

,
Using these two tools, open a jump ring and attach the flower shaped crystal bead.

,
To open jump rings, hold both pliers in each hand and grab the jump ring right next to the gap.,
After putting the flower piece on, use both pliers to grab both sides of the ring near the gap, and turn it to return the ring to the original position before having opened it.,Now take the wire and pass it through the ring.,
Next, just like a while ago, put on two seed beads, then a light colored Swarovski bead, then two more seed beads, then a fuscia Swarovski bead, then again two more seed beads, and then a light rose Swarovski bead.,
Next, in the same way as the first half of the necklace, put on two seed beads, then a Swarovski crystal bead.,Now just like with the first half, repeat the pattern 21 times for the remaining half.,Now move on to the last part and finish the wire.,To do this, in the same way already learned, pass the wire through the bottom of the clam shell part, then put on the crimp bead.,Next crimp the crimp bead inside the clam shell part, but one thing to be careful about is to crimp the bead right down next to the exact edge inside the clam shell part, and then close the two sides of the clam shell part, there will be no space at all between the beads and they just don’t look or feel as nice compared to leaving a little bit of room between them.,
So when crimping the crimp bead move it up just a little bit, only about the width of a seed bead.,After crimping the crimp bead, just like before, run the wire back through the hole, and pull it down.,
Then, just like earlier take the wire and feed it through our beads to a length of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).,
The next thing to make sure of is that the wire doesn’t emerge from one of the seed beads, but make sure it emerged from one of the Swarovski beads.,So now with the wire coming out at about 2 inches (5.1 cm), take the flash cutter and cut the wire.,Then close the two sides of the clam shell part with the flat nosed pliers.,
After closing the clam shell, take the extender part and place it on the hook.,
Finished.

",How to String a Crystal Bead Necklace,";
,,


This extender allows making a necklace up to 2 inches (5.1 cm) longer.
Also needed are two clam shells which will be used to hide the finished end.

, These are placed at the end of the wire or string, and then just pinched with chain nose pliers to finish.

, They have a slight gap in them and are used when connecting different parts together.

,, With the crimp bead about 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the end of the wire, take the chain nose pliers and crimp the bead.

, When doing this, the crimp bead is not exposed so it can be hidden. Close the clam shell now using the chain nose pliers so that the crimp bead is completely hidden.

, Then bend down the edge of the hook.

,,


Looking closely, only the sterling silver parts can be seen, not any portion of the wire.

,,


This necklace is 14 to 16 inches (35.6 to 40.6 cm) long for a little girl but more beads can be added to make a longer necklace.

,,,


Now the short wire has become completely concealed inside the beads.
When sliding the beads down they completely cover the end of the short wire so that there is only one wire left.

,,,, Using 2 different shade color beads will make the color flow nicely.


First one light rose Swarovski bead and 2 seed beads, then use a fuchsia colored Swarovski bead, which make a nice focal point, then 2 seed beads.
Next a light rose Swarovski, and 2 seed beads.

And with that the necklace is half finished.



,,,, Then, open not pulling side ways, but by twisting up and twisting down at the same time. If opening a jump ring by pulling side ways, it may change the ring shape and it won’t close very well when closing it.,

Now it can be closed in a way that looks very nice and professional.

,, That will complete the middle part of the necklace., Go ahead and repeat this same pattern 21 times and then go on to the next step.,,,,, It’s just a little bit of space but it really makes a big difference. Also make sure that there's not too much space as the beads will then be too loose.,, If the wire comes out before reaching the two inches, just take it and feed it back in., If the wire comes out from one of the larger beads, after cutting the wire there's no need to worry about the end or the wire popping out when wearing the necklace and the beads move a little bit on the wire.,,, Then with the round nose pliers bend the hook down, and finally squeeze it just a little more with the flat nosed pliers.,"
"
Measure the window or doorway that you plan on having the curtains in.,
Cut a ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) diameter wooden rod according to your measurement.,
Attach the hooks.,
Rest the curtain rod on top of the hooks.,
Measure and cut your fishing line.,
Tie the fishing line to a split ring.,
Get some beads.,
Start stringing your beads.,
Add a 2-hole bead at the end.,
Tie the ends off.,
Hang the strand on the curtain, and start on the next one.,
Continue cutting and beading your strands until you have as many as you like on your curtain rod.,
Hang the curtain rod in place.,
Consider adding some decorative ornaments to the ends of your curtain rod.",How to Make Beaded Curtains," Take a measuring tape, and measure across the window/doorway. Add about 6 to 12 inches (15.24 to 30.46 centimeters) to your measurement. This way, your finished rod will extend 3 to 6 inches (7.62 to 15.24 centimeters) past the window/doorway on both sides.If you want the curtain to be inside the window/doorway, then measure inside the frame, along the top edge. Do not add any extra measurements.;
, Use strong, sturdy wood, such as oak, for this. These curtains can get heavy, so you want the rod to be strong enough to hold them up. Do not use a tension rod; it won't be sturdy enough.You can cut the wood yourself using a saw, or you can ask the hardware store to do it for you.
If you already have a sturdy metal rod, you can use that instead.

, Place the hooks against the wall, then insert the screws. Make sure that you are drilling the holes into the wooden support beams and not into sheetrock. If you drill the holes into sheetrock, the weight of the curtains will pull the rod right off the wall.Depending on how wide your window or doorway is, you will need between 2 and 3 hooks. The wider the window/doorway is, the more hooks you will need.
If you are going to mount the curtain inside your window/doorway, then drill the holes into the frame itself. You will need to get a special type of mounts intended for hanging curtains inside windows.

, Hanging the rod before you bead will allow you to determine how long your curtains will be. It will also keep the strands from getting tangled while you work on them.


If you are resting the curtain inside the window/doorway, be prepared for a tight fit. You may have to sand down the end of the curtain rod.

, Measure how long you want your curtains to be, starting from the top of the curtain rod. Double your measurement and 12 inches (30.46 centimeters) to it. Cut your fishing line accordingly.You are cutting your fishing line twice as long because you will be folding it in half and inserting two strands inside each bead. The extra 12 inches (30.46 centimeters) will allow you to finish off the curtains.


Cut and work on one strand at a time. If you cut too many strands at once, the fishing line may turn into a tangled mess.
If you don't have any fishing line, you can also try using strong, sturdy thread, colored string, or even wire. Whatever you decide to use, make sure that it is thin enough to go through your beads.

, Find the center of your fishing line, then slip it through the split ring. Tie 2 to 3 knots beneath the slip ring to keep the fishing line secure; you can also use a slipknot instead. Make sure that the fishing line is centered, and that both strands are the same length.Work on one ring at a time. Hang each ring onto the rod as soon as you finish it.
Split rings are the same thing as keychain rings. Because of their design, they don't have any gaps that your fishing line might slip through. They are also very strong and sturdy.

, You will needs lots of beads, more than you think you'd need. They don't all have to be fancy glass beads; they can be plastic, wood, or even homemade. You could even take apart costume jewelry, and use the beads from that. The funkier the beads are, the better!


Colored glass beads are wonderful for this project because they are translucent and catch the light well.
If you are using colored string, consider using clear beads for a cool effect.
Consider getting some 2-hole beads for the end of your curtain strands. You will one 2-hole bead for each strand.

, Take your first bead, and thread it onto the fishing line. Make sure that you are putting the bead through both strands of fishing line. Pull the bead all the way down to the split ring, and add the next. Keep doing this until you have about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of string left.


Your beads don't all have to be the same size. Play around with different patterns. For example, you could use mostly small beads on your curtain, and use a large, chunky bead every couple of inches/centimeters.

, This time, put one strand of fishing line through each hole. If you do not have any 2-hole beads, use a larger bead instead. Turn the bead so that the holes are pointing to the side instead of up-and-down. Take one strand of fishing line, and pull it through the left hole. Take the other strand of fishing line, and pull it through the right hole., Tie about 3 knots under the bead, then bring the ends of the fishing line back through the holes. Thread the strands back through the first couple of beads (about 2 inches/5.08 centimeters), then trim them off.If you are using a regular bead instead of a 2-hole bead, tie the knots above the bead instead.
Consider placing a drop of superglue over the knot. This will make it stronger and less-likely to slip.

, It may sound like a lot of work, constantly getting up and sliding the split ring onto your curtain rod, but it will help keep your work from getting tangled., They do not all have to be the same length, but remember to add 12 inches (30.46 centimeters) to each strand so that you can finish it off properly. A great idea would be to make your curtains a angle upwards in ^ shape.

, Make adjustments as needed to ensure that the curtain is hanging evenly. If you used glass beads, the light behind the curtain will catch the colors of the beads and make them glow—just like a suncatcher.

, This is not mandatory, and it won't be possible for a curtain rod mounted inside the window or doorway, but it can take your design to the next level. It will also prevent the split rings from sliding off when you move the curtain around. You can use simple wooden ornaments, and attach them to each end of your curtain rod with wood glue. You can also get metal, glass, or ceramic curtain rod ornaments, and screw them on; you will need to drill holes into the curtain rod first, however.

Gather your supplies.,
Add an end piece to your wire.,
Form a loop.,
Slide the crimp bead down the wire.,
Flatten the bead.,
Round the bead.,
Use chain or needle nose pliers.,
String your decorative beads.,
Tighten your beads.,
Add a crimp cover for a nice touch.",How to Use Crimp Beads," First, determine what size wire you have. Use an online chart to make sure you have the right size crimp beads for your wire. Take into consideration how many strands of wire or thread you will be crimping at once, as this will increase the size of bead you’ll need.For example, if you are using one 0.020” (0.51 mm) piece of wire, you will need a bead with a diameter of 0.04” (1.02 mm). But, if you are using two strands of wire, you will need a bead with a diameter of 0.08”.;
, To secure one end of the wire so that your beads don’t fall off, you’ll need some sort of an end piece, such as a clasp. When you are ready to attach a clasp, first thread the end of your beading wire (jewelry cable) through a crimp bead and then through the eye of the clasp.Your design might call for other kinds of end pieces, such as a closed or solid jump ring or extender chain. The same methods apply for these as for clasps.

, Form the loop through the clasp and crimp bead. After threading the crimp and clasp, feed the wire back through the crimp bead, forming a loop. It is a good idea to leave a tail of wire a couple of inches longer than you think you need so you will have some wire to work with., Move the crimp bead close to the end of the clasp or end piece. Check the crimp bead and make sure it is not too close to the clasp or end piece. You want to have a small loop around the clasp or end piece, but not so small that it holds the clasp so tightly that it cannot move freely. , Use crimping pliers to flatten the bead. Squeeze the beads with the flatter back channel of the crimping pliers that is closest to the handle. Gently but firmly squeeze the pliers closed. This will both flatten and place a dent in the middle of the crimp bead so that it resembles the letter “C”., Round it with crimping pliers. Place the dented crimp bead in the front, rounder channel of the crimping pliers, closest to the tip. Position the “C” upright so that when you close the pliers and squeeze, the bead will be folded closed right on the dent (closing the “C” into an “O”). Squeeze gently but firmly and until the crimp bead has closed tightly around the wire.Tug gently to make sure the wire doesn't pull free. If necessary, use pliers to make it close tighter.

, If you don’t have a pair of crimping pliers, you can use regular pliers. They get the job done, but they won’t give you the same round, uniform crimps that crimping pliers will. To use these pliers, simply grasp the crimp bead with the flat section of the pliers and squeeze gently but tightly to smash the crimp bead flat onto the wire.


Only use flat pliers or the flat section of pliers. The teeth in these pliers will also leave grooves on the surface of the crimp bead.

, Use whatever beads you are designing your bracelet, necklace, or other piece of jewelry with. Thread your first bead onto the wire. Thread the extra tail of wire through the bead hole. Use your flush cutters to cut off the loose end of the cord as close as possible to the bead. Thread the rest of your beads according to your design until you reach the other end., When you are ready to attach your final clasp to the end of your piece, thread the crimp bead and clasp just like before, but now you will want to tighten all of your beads by pulling on the tail end of the loose wire. This will snug all your beads up together, leaving no gaps in your design.You will need to leave a small, finger-nail length gap between the beads if you have long tube beads in your design.
You need to make sure the beads and wire make the small circumference around a wrist if you are making a bracelet.
If you need more leverage to pull the wire tight, use your pliers; one to hold the clasp and the other to grasp and pull the wire.

, If you want to hide your crimp beads, you can get crimp covers. A crimp cover looks like a larger, round bead that goes on top of the crimp bead or tube to give it a professional finish. To add a crimp cover, simply slide it over the crimp bead and squeeze it shut with a pair of pliers."

Measure the desired length of the tassel.,
Determine the number of trailers you want.,
Cut a length of upholstery thread that coincides with the length of the desired number of trailers, and insert the end of the thread through the eye of a beading needle.,
Use what is known as a starter or master bead at the bottom of the thread.,
Follow with a succession of beads to create the length of beads desired for each trailer on the tassel.,
Slide the succession of beads onto the trailer.,
Repeat the process for each of the trailers desired for the tassel until the desired number of trailers are complete.

,
Combine the trailers to form the head of the tassel.,
Thread a larger bead over the knot of the loop and the knot.,
Finished.

",How to Make Beaded Tassels," Allow roughly 3 times the amount of length that you need for the finished product, as this allows room for not only the head of the tassel but also length of the trailers.;
, Many designs call for a minimum of 9, but use whatever number will work well in your application

, Tie a knot at 1 end of the upholstery thread.

, The starter bead is normally a larger bead in the design that serves as the stopper for the rest of the beads in the strand.

, Make the design as eclectic or as simple as you like. Beads can vary in size and shape, depending on the look you wish to achieve.

, Cut off the knot at the end of the upholstery thread, and attach 1 end of the trailer. Gently pull the trailer through the beads until the top of the trailer emerges from the last bead in the series. Make sure the trailer is taut, with no extra length along the strand. Promptly tie 1 end of the trailer to keep the beads in position.

,, Knot the individual trailers together, positioning the knot as close to the beads as possible, but far away enough that the trailers can hang freely. Loop the trailer, and tie in place to create a means of hanging the tassel.

, This helps to hide the knot and give the tassel a finished look. If desired, use a small drop of hot glue to hold the bead in position.

Even before throwing (which is the term used when making a pot on the wheel) you need to make yourself comfortable.,
Slam a round ball of clay as close to the center of the wheel as possible.,
Start the wheel and allow it to spin slowly.,
Place your hands on the cone only after the wheel is going at a medium pace.,
While pressing down with the thumb into the center of the piece, use your other hand to guide your thumb into the piece.,
Once a hole is established use both of your hands to widen the gap.,
Squeeze the walls up by placing your index finger of your left hand on the inside while your right index finger is on the outside.,
Repeat pulling until the walls of the cylinder are thick enough for you, which is about a quarter of an inch thick.,
Cup a moderately wet sponge around the top edge of the piece and apply slight pressure to make the edge rounded and more appealing.

,
Slowly slide a wire underneath your piece while the wheel is moving at a slow pace.",How to Throw a Cylinder," Sit with your legs spread wide so that you can rest your elbows on the inside of your thighs. This is to allow more pressure to come from your entire body onto the piece rather than just your hands.;
, This serves two purposes, one so that the clay will stick well to the wheel and also to eliminate air bubbles that are in the clay.

, As the wheel is turning dampen your hands and get the ball wet as well. Then start patting the ball into a cone shame until it is no longer wobbling.

, Again force the clay into the center of the wheel. If you are right handed your left elbow should dig into your left thigh. Your entire body is used to center the piece.

, Press your arms into your side to keep your arms from moving. Leave enough clay on the bottom of the piece so that you will be able to have a bottom.

, When water builds up on the bottom of the cylinder use a dry sponge to soak up the excess water.

, This is called pulling, be careful not to puncture the clay, however apply enough force so that clay is being forced upwards. How fast you pull up on the piece is affected by how fast the wheel is moving. Therefore the quicker the wheel is spinning the faster you can finish a piece. It is better to not go fast when you are first starting out, once you feel more comfortable with the motions you will be able to go faster.

, If there is a large amount of clay around the base of the piece then trim the base of the piece with a wooden tool that is cut at a 45 degree angle.

,, Careful not to go through the bottom of your piece. Make sure that the wire hugs the wheel tightly.

Do the static test.,
Know what to expect from each type of amber.,
Check your amber piece for seams and mold marks, which indicate it may actually be made from plastic.

",How to Test Amber Gemstones,"


Vigorously rub your amber on some wool for about 20 seconds to create static. 
Take a strand of hair and place the static-charged amber close to it.  Real genuine amber should quickly attract the hair towards it, with the hair gently sticking to the gemstone.  If no static is produced after rubbing on wool (ie it doesn't attract the hair) then you might have a piece of fake amber.;
,


Genuine amber is lightweight and warm to touch, not cold and heavy like glass.
Loose amber beads can be tested in salt water.  Add 25g of salt to 200ml water in a glass and drop your amber into it.  Genuine amber should float, not quickly sink to the bottom.
Genuine amber reacts to ultraviolet light. Take your amber into a darkened room and  shine a cheap UV torch on it.  If it gently glows, it's real.

Understand the value of a vintage typewriter before you begin to shop.,
Buy a typewriter collecting book, or borrow 1 at the library.,
Know typewriter terminology.,
Use extreme caution before buying typewriters off the Internet.,
Begin shopping at local pawn shops.,
Shop at antique malls or stores for working typewriters.,
Visit estate sales or garage sales.,
Keep track on eBay auctions for vintage typewriters.,
Buy from a trusted online seller like VintageTypewriterShoppe.com or MrTypewriter.com.,
Look on the Freecycle network or craigslist for free or low-cost typewriters.",How to Buy Vintage Typewriters," Doing research can save you money in the end, and the following information can help you get started:


Vintage typewriters are generally those made before 1920. These machines can often command a price between $300 and $10,000.
There are a number of vintage typewriters that use other methods than the ""QWERTY"" keyboard. These command much higher prices.
Common American typewriter models include: Remington, Royal, Underwood, and Smith Corona. A popular German brand is the Olympia. Other vintage models to look for are the Blickensderfer, Hammond and Oliver.
The Underwood number 5 is possibly the most common vintage typewriter on the market today. It was mass-produced for the first half of the 20th century. It is renowned for being convenient, fairly light and striking.
It is rare to find a typewriter for less than $100 (64 pounds, 74 euros). Jewelry makers are willing to pay that much to deconstruct a typewriter's keyboard and use the keys for jewelry. A typewriter under $100 is very unlikely to work, and it may need to be refurbished.;
, Some good titles for research are American Typewriters: A Collector's Encyclopedia by Paul Lippman or Antique Typewriters: From Creed to QWERTY by Michael Adler.

, This will help you determine if a typewriter is in need of a major repair, or a simple replacement. Become familiar with the keys, type bars, carriage, platen, ribbon and carriage return mechanism.

, Unless the typewriter is listed on a collector website, it is unlikely the person is qualified to determine the condition of the typewriter. A ""like-new"" typewriter, listed on eBay, may be broken and require several hundred dollars of refurbishing before it can work.


Typewriters are bulky and heavy. They can be easily damaged during shipment. If you buy an old typewriter online, be sure you can return it if it is packaged poorly and damaged upon arrival.

, Pawn shops in both cities and small towns often have typewriters in fairly good condition. Although pawn sellers often have a good grasp on what a typewriter is worth, you may be able to barter to get a lower price.

, Antiques dealers are aware of the value of antique typewriters, so it is likely that they would sell you something in very good condition.

, People who worked in an office during the last century, often used typewriters at home. It is not uncommon to find an Underwood at an advertised estate sale or garage sale.

, Ebay typewriter auction can be a gamble, because there is no guarantee of condition. There is a wide selection, but overbidding is very common.

, These sites guarantee their typewriters and offer a wide variety. Prices for typewriters in working order may be more expensive and include a high shipping price, but it may save you on repair costs.

, Freecycle.org connects groups that give items away, and Craigslist's classified encourage low prices for people looking to get rid of items quickly. These typewriters are ideal for repurposing because they are likely to be in poor condition.

Find an area to start your search.,
Set your sluice box directly in the current so that the box is filled with water almost to the top.,
Begin Running Material through your Sluice.,
Tend your Sluice while running material through.,
Perform a ""Cleanup"" of your sluice.,
To perform a clean up carefully lift the sluice box out of the current, while keeping it as level as possible.,
Rinse the material out of your sluice into your bucket using lots of water.,
Pan the concentrate.",How to Use a Sluice for Gold," For your sluice to work, you need to find a source of running water, in the same area where gold can be found. Your sluice utilizes flowing water and gravity to separate the lighter gravel (the “tailings”) from the heavier material (gold, black sand), by keeping the lighter material in a state of “suspension” as the material is carried through the sluice and collecting the heavier materials on the back side of the riffles. This works on the basis that gold is 19 times denser than water, and much heavier than the material it is found in. So when you run material through the sluice, gold will fall out, and valueless material will continue through. Walk along the stream bank and look for a promising place where you can set up your sluice. Keep in mind that you will want to set up your sluice close to where you will be digging up your gold bearing gravel. You will need to find a place where the current is moving quite swiftly. Once you find such a place,;
, It is important to make sure your upper (input) end is slightly higher than the lower (discharge) end. It is also important to make sure the box is level (horizontally) and stable, this can be done easily by placing rock around and under the box.

, Once the sluice is stable you can begin feeding your gold bearing gravel into the upper portion of the sluice box in carefully regulated amounts. It is important to not dump large amounts of gravel in the sluice all at once, or it will over load the riffles and your gold, along with all the gravel, will simply be washed through. Make a note to keep an eye on the top part of each riffle when you are feeding material through. If you cannot see the top edge, then you are feeding too much material through to quickly. Note: By using a “classifier” screen to filter down the gravel to a uniform size before its run through the sluice it can save time and help prevent your riffles from overloading with material, where gold can be lost.

, It is important that after running a load of gravel through your sluice to check the riffle section for waste material and valuables. It is important to clear waste material from the sluice in between loads so that it does not change the flow and allow heavy material to be washed out. It is also necessary to shovel away the material that comes out the end of your sluice (the tailings) so water flow is not interrupted over your riffles and material can continue to leave your sluice. It is also important to check for valuable material caught on the black mat and in the riffle area that can be removed.

, When you are tending your sluice it is important to notice when it is time for a cleanup. It is time for a clean up when your riffles have accumulated black iron sands and gravel in amounts that extend more than halfway down to the next lower riffle.

, Take the sluice to the bank, and set tail end in a bucket (or container that you have available) making sure to not spill any material.

, It is ok to overflow your bucket with water because all of the gold will sink to the bottom, and will not spill out. If your sluice has removable riffles and carpeting, remove those at this time and rinse those thoroughly into the bucket as well. At this time you should have a sluice that has been cleaned of all the concentrates you collected and a bucket with the concentrate safe at the bottom.

, To get the gold out of your concentrates you will need to pan them. Instructions on “how to pan for gold” can be found on this site (link can be found below in related articles).

Wash off stones, and brush off debris.,
Assemble a batch of stones with similar properties.,
Add stones to the tumbler, along with some grit, a specialty item sold at geology stores, and some cushioning material such as plastic pellets or beads to prevent stones from being chipped or broken during sustained impact.,
Start the tumbler, and check for appropriate function.,
Run the tumbler for a long period of time.,
Periodically sift out waste materials on a multiple day tumbling.",How to Tumble Stones," Cleaner stones mean less upkeep during the tumbling process.;
, Stones should be of roughly the same material hardness, and, for optimal results, the same basic size (though for convenience, multiple sizes can be tumbled at once).

, Experts recommend filling the tumbler up to about 50% to 60% of volume for most loads. Start with a coarser grit, and progress to a finer grit as necessary.

, Wait several minutes. Listen to the tumbler to check for any aggressive sounds that would indicate malfunction. A steady, shifting noise means that the tumbler is working properly.

, Some experts recommend several days, but depending on the rock type, a one-day cycle may be sufficient. Check stones after one day to see if they need more tumbling.

, Every 24 hours, check the stones, and also filter out any built up material that has accumulated. Pros call this mix “slurry.” It is composed of sloughed off bits from rocks. For finer tumbling, replace the grit after several days with a finer variety up to several hundred mesh.

Look at the object’s thickness.,
Test the clarity of the object.,
Hold the object up to the light.",How to Tell Crystal from Glass1," Crystal is sculpted over a longer time period at lower temperature than glass. Because of this, the lead inside the crystal can be shaped into thinner, more intricate designs. Hold a glass object next to a crystal one and compare the thickness of the material.


On a crystal wine glass, for instance, look for a thinner rim with less of a lip.;
, Take a liquid and pour it into the object or hold the object up and look through it. Regular glass is cloudier than crystal. Crystal with a higher lead content provides a clearer view of anything inside or behind it.For example, a normal drinking glass will make a liquid inside it appear cloudy. Crystal glasses, on the other hand, provide a greater view of the liquid.

, When you hold glass up to the light, nothing happens. Fine crystal, which has a high lead count, will sparkle. Other crystal acts as a prism, causing you to see a rainbow when looking through it."
"
Check the object’s weight.,
Feel the object for sharpness.,
Strike the object to test its sound.",How to Tell Crystal from Glass2," Because crystal is made with lead, it feels heavier than glass. Pick up the object and you should notice it feels solid and with some heft. Pick up a glass object of a comparable size. Most likely, it will feel light.Lead-free crystal feels lighter and more durable but still shines when held up to the light., Due to the sculpting process, crystal has a smooth, rounded feel. Touch any decorative facets you find. Also run your hand along the object’s surface. Glass feels more brittle, even though crystal is more fragile. The cut on the glass may also feel sharper., Flick the object with your finger or tap it against something solid. If it is crystal, it will ring. If it is glass, it will produce a thud.Wet your finger and rub it around the object’s rim, if possible. Crystal will produce a musical tone, but glass won’t.

Study the artist’s background beforehand.,
Browse the museum’s or artists’ collections online.,
Ask a friend who won’t judge.",How to Pretend to Understand Art1," Knowing something about the artist when you visit the museum can help you understand the context of their artwork. It can also give you something to say during conversations about the artist and their work..;
, Depending on which museum or gallery you’re visiting, you might be able to preview the collection you’re seeing on a website. This gives you more time to look at and think about the pieces you’ll be seeing. And you can do so without the pressure of feeling like you have to contribute to the conversation happening around you.


For example, if you are about to visit MOMA (the Museum of Modern Art in NYC) you could do some research about modern art in general and research some of the pieces in the gallery.

, Perhaps one of your pals has an idea of what kind of art you may be seeing and/or even have personal information about the artist. Ask them to share some of their knowledge. There’s nothing wrong with admitting you don’t know much about the artist or type of art you’ll be seeing and asking someone to educate you.

Gather your materials.,
Add your beads.,
Continue adding beads.,
Use a pair of round-nose pliers to bend the top of your head-pin.,
Bend the top of the endpin into a loop using the round-nose pliers.,
Add the earring hook.,
Make your second earring and enjoy!",How to Make Bead Earrings1," Making beaded earrings is quite easy. However, you will need to have some special materials ready before you get started. You will probably need to visit a craft store to find everything, or you can order your materials online. Before you begin, you will need:Endpins (looks like a straight wire with a small button at the end). Endpins are available in many thicknesses to accommodate different sizes of beads. Sometimes you will see the thickness mentioned by gauge (ga) on the packaging. In this case, a larger number (for example, 24 ga) indicates a thinner endpin, while a smaller number (for example, 20 ga) indicates a thicker headpin.
Beads in the colors and types of your choice
Round nose pliers
Earring hooks
Wire cutters;
, First, put a spacer bead or a bead with a smaller hole than your other beads at the bottom of the endpin, then add the beads of your choice on the endpin.








Arrange the beads in the order you want them to create a colorful pattern.
Experiment with different colors and styles.
Use spacer beads to separate colors if desired.

, Keep adding beads to the endpin until you have 1








If you want your earrings to be shorter, use a pair of wire cutters to snip the headpin to the appropriate length.

, Bend the head pin until it is at a 90 degree angle to the beads. This will help to secure the beads in place and begin the attachment to your earring hook.








, This loop allows you to add a post or wire to complete the earring at the end of the headpin with the round-nose pliers. Using the tip of the pliers as a guide, form the end of the headpin into a neat loop.








If there is any excess wire going out from the loop, then snip it at the base of the loop using a pair of wire cutters. Make sure to wear eye protection when you do this because the wire may fly up towards your face.

, Next you will need to attach the earring hook to the loop. Do this before you close the loop all the way. Then, use your round nose pliers to close the loop.







, After you have created one earring, you will just need to make a second earring in the same manner, and you will have a completed pair of beaded earrings! Try them on, give them as a gift, or add them to your stock of handmade jewelry to sell.

Look carefully at the piece.,
Consider the piece as a whole.,
Interpret the piece.,
Trust your instincts.",How to Pretend to Understand Art2," Once you get to the museum or gallery you’re visiting, choose a piece of art and really look at it. Even if you have no previous knowledge of the artist or the collection, you can ask yourself some questions about it. What is it? A painting, a photograph, a sculpture? What’s it made of? Paint, pencil, plastic? How did the artist approach the medium? Does it look rushed? Like it took a lot of time? Looking at the piece and asking yourself questions can give you some material to work with when you’re talking to your friends., Once you've noted what the piece is, what it's made out of, and how the artist might have approached it, look at the piece as a whole. How do the different elements come together in one piece of art? How does it make you feel? Is there something sad about the medium used? Joyful? Consider the ""big picture"" of the piece of art and how the smaller components contribute to it. Being able to discuss those things can help you seem like you ""get"" art., Try to place it in the historical context in which it was created. That’s where those plaques next to artwork come in handy. They might tell you about the artist’s life, why the artist used specific materials, or what was happening in the world when the piece was created. Use those context clues to draw meaning from the art., It’s totally okay to look at a piece of art and decide that you like it – or don’t – based only on your instincts. But if you do feel that way, take some time looking at the piece and trying to figure out why you do or don’t like it. It could be because of the colors, or maybe the shape of the piece, or the way someone or something in it looks. Being able to articulate why you do or don’t like a piece of art can make you seem like you “get” it in conversation with others."
"
Ask what other people think.,
Draw comparisons to things you know better.,
Give a general response.",How to Pretend to Understand Art3," If you can't think of anything to say in conversation about art, ask others what they think. This takes the attention off of you and is a good conversational practice (you should interest in other people you're speaking to).Really pay attention to what others are saying. It's good manners and they might say something that gives you an idea for your own contribution to the conversation.

, If possible, draw comparisons between the art you're looking at and/or discussing and a topic you're more comfortable with. It gives you the chance to speak about something you're more comfortable with. It can also make you look like you understand art even more, because you can connect it to other things.For example, maybe you're an avid reader and you have a favorite author. Does any of the artwork you're discussing remind you of the way you've imagined a scene in a book? Share that.

, Sometimes you just might not be able to think of anything to say, and that's okay! You can say something like ""I don't know much about that,"" or ""I'm not really feeling it."" Responding in a general way can also signal to other people that it's okay for them to talk a little more if they know more about the topic."

Grab a refrigerator magnet.,
Try to determine if the rock is significantly heavier than other rocks of the same size.,
Examine the outer skin of the rock.,
If the crust is more than a couple of millimeters thick, it's not a meteorite.

Try to scratch it with a knife blade.,
If it has layers, it's not a meteorite.

If you have a rock with several meteorite characteristics (Fusion Crust, ""Thumbprints"", magnetism, heavy, metallic appearance, softer than a knife blade, weak or no streak), and none of the non-meteorite characteristics (Bubbles, wrong shape, layers, thick crust or no crust, harder than a knife blade, red or brown streak), see an expert.",How to Tell if the Rock You Found Might Be a Meteorite," See if the rock is attracted to the magnet. Most, but not all, meteorites will be attracted to a magnet.;
, Again, many meteorites are heavy for their size.

, Meteorites will have a ""Fusion Crust"" that usually has a darker color than the interior of the rock.

,, Is the inner color a metallic steel color? If so, it might be a Nickel-Iron meteorite.

, A meteorite will leave a weak or light streak. If it makes a red or brown streak, it's not a meteorite.

, If it has these, it's not a meteorite. It's probably a piece of industrial slag, or a volcanic rock.

Figure out your own motives.,
Be aware that each of the above motivations are relevant - and each requires a different game plan.,
If you are investing, then you must do your homework and build contacts in the art world, that you can trust.,
Know that rarity equals value as well as quality.,
Understand the smaller the edition, the higher the price.,
Do your research.,
Educate yourself.,
Develop your art taste buds by looking at lots of art, and hone your appreciation for the aesthetics.,
Develop an understanding of the artists.,
Choose the art that's right for you.,
Go out and view lots of artworks.,
Talk your own language.,
You don't need to spend a lot of money.,
Above all, don't rush.,
Find a dealer that you can trust.,
Avoid salespeople.,
Also remember that a dealer who trusts their own choices won't refer to an artwork's price history as their primary justification.

,
An artwork's price history on its own is no guarantee of anything, and will only give you other people's (possibly inaccurate) predictions.

,
Get the price right.,
Ask your dealer if you can exchange the work in the future.,
Build a relationship with the auction house.,
Observe, listen, learn and ask questions.,
Remember, a collector should be as passionate about the work as the artist; which can require you to be very passionate indeed.

,
Bear in mind the hidden costs.,
Also remember that, with art, you are buying objects that have a life of their own.,
Avoid the biggest mistake a collector can make; not being informed enough!,
Be warned that if you treat art like a commodity, you will end up with stocks or certificates on your wall.,
Equip yourself with a knowledge of art history, the history of the markets, and the current art scene.,
Above all, ensure that you amass a collection that you will love and can live with (potentially) for the rest of your life.

",How to Start an Art Collection," Do you want something to brighten up your room, or match the curtains? Or are you hoping to make money from the recovering art market? Or are you attracted to art as a fascinating long-term commitment?;
, If you are looking for something you like, then it's easy: go with your gut feelings.

, In other words, you can buy art from a West London heavyweight dealer and be assured of its quality, but end up spending more money. Or you can go to an East London gallery that showcases young artists, and spend less money but with more risk. Whichever you choose, you must be prepared.

, So, one-off originals are more valuable than multiple prints. Paintings, drawings and collages are normally one-offs, but sculptures are often produced in editions of nine.

, One way to make sure of this is that the artwork you like is signed and numbered. This is also true of photographs. Of course, photos can be reproduced very easily, so seek verification.

, Is the artist dead? Then make sure that the photo is vintage, ie, authorized by him or her. If the photo is modern, then does it come with the original negative to ensure that it isn't a copy? Also, in today's age of digital photography, some studios make a point of producing hand-printed, signed originals.

, Art, they say, is an intellectual pursuit. Your collection should be embraced as an educational process.

, Learn about the different artists (how they have progressed over time, for instance) and feel your passion grow.

, A good way to do this is to start with drawings. Buy posters and postcards and put them on the walls of your home or desk. This will train your eye, and help you realize the aspects of art you love, and those you find forgettable.

, Collectors have many different methods for choosing the works they wish to buy. A prolific and globally-renowned collector like David Geffen, the very wealthy record label executive, often cites the ""wow"" factor (in other words, he buys art which makes him think ""wow!"").

, Getting to know what you are like as a collector requires that you do so. Also, museums, galleries and auctioneers are making themselves increasingly accessible to collectors, so join their mailing lists.

, Always remember: there is no ""right way to discuss art,"" so don't be shy when you meet connoisseurs. Also, don't worry that you ""know nothing about art"". You know what you know, and must feel free and confident to talk about it in your own language.

, In terms of money, remember that collecting is an evolutionary process. Look at some of the greatest collections in the world: they started with initial purchases or just a few thousand dollars, and were then built upwards. Good art dealers appreciate this, and will work with you to build your collection up.

, It is vital that you take your time.

, This will generally be a dealer who makes themselves available, and will work with you to learn and slowly build up your significant collection. The best dealers are like counselors, and should be worthy of your trust.

, Especially those who sell art as a commodity. Art collecting revolves around passion and belief. Relying on saleability as your ultimate goal simply won't work.

,,, While price should never be your main driving factor, look at the amounts works have been selling for at auctions or at past shows.

, Or, can they can resell it if you later want to buy something else, or something better, by an artist?

, It helps to have contacts. Introduce yourself to the representatives in your field of interest. Ideally, you should know the people at the auction house as well as you know your favorite dealer.

, Especially if you are there mainly for investment reasons. Talking to people can be key: be prepared to question the artist's dealer, or even the artist, about the work itself.

,, The costs of restoration and framing can be costly, and insurance is vital. Works on paper should be kept away from sunlight. If the works are going to be on a wall, it needs to be glazed according to museum standards with acid-free matting and ultraviolet light-resistance glass. If the work is more than 10 years old, then you should have an art conservator look at it before it is framed.

, If you maintain and look after your art, you may one day be asked to loan them to an artist or museum. Over the art's lifetime, you may find yourself dealing with museums and other institutions as a custodian of the historic artwork, rather than simply as an owner.

, Otherwise you may buy something that doesn't possess the depth a work of art should evoke. Or pass on something and later you realize that you should have bought it. It is better to take chances - but ensure that those chances are born of a genuine passion.

, In other words, you will potentially be surrounded by things that you don't like and don't want to live with.

, It can also help to become a member of an art dealers' association.

Find a qualified appraiser.,

Sell your diamonds to a jewelry dealer.,
Sell your diamonds through a consignment shop.,
Sell your diamonds directly to the public.",How to Sell Diamonds," Getting a professional appraisal is especially important if you suspect that your diamond jewelry is worth $2000 or more.Most professional appraisers belong to an appraisal association, and these associations can help you find certified appraisers in your area. You can find a list of appraisal associations that specialize in gemstones here: https://www.gia.edu/library-appraisal-associations;
, There are different reasons to get jewelry appraised. If the appraiser understands that your goal is to sell your jewelry (rather than, say, to get it insured), then they will be able to give you a more realistic idea of your jewelry’s resale value., You will be in a better position to get the best price for your diamonds if you can give potential buyers plenty of information about them. In addition to asking your appraiser for the resale value of the diamonds, try to find out about the following factors, which can affect the value and desirability of a diamond:Color: The Gemological Institute of America rates diamonds on a color scale from D (most colorless) to Z (highest color). In general, the more colorless the diamond, the higher its value (with the exception of “fancy color diamonds,” such as pink and blue diamonds).Cut: This refers to the shape of the diamond and the quality of the cut.
Clarity: This is a measurement of the flawlessness of the stone. The Gemological Institute of America rates diamonds from “Flawless” (no inclusions or imperfections) to I3 (the highest level of “Included”).Carat: This is a measure of the weight of a diamond.

, If you have a diamond or diamonds set in a piece of jewelry, this can also have an impact on the value and desirability of your diamonds. Find out what the setting is made of, what condition it is in, and (if possible) how old it is.


If you have any information about your diamond jewelry already (e.g. where it came from, when it was purchased, how much you or whoever purchased it originally paid for it, or whether it has ever been reset), share it with your appraiser. This may help them understand your piece better and give them a better idea of its value.

, Ask your appraiser for a written appraisal report and a sealed statement of value. The report should include a clear explanation of how the value of the piece was assessed, and should also describe the reason for the appraisal (since this will affect the assigned value of the piece)., If you can’t afford to hire an appraiser, or if you suspect your diamonds are worth less than $2000, you can get a ballpark estimate of your piece’s value by going to a jeweler who buys or sells diamonds.Take your diamond jewelry to two or three local fine jewelry stores so that you can get a range of opinions on the piece’s value.
A good jeweler should be able to give you at least a general idea of the quality and condition of your diamonds and their setting.

, If you’ve had your diamonds appraised for resale value, you should have a good ballpark estimate of what they are worth. However, keep in mind that potential buyers of used diamond jewelry are probably looking for a good deal or hoping to make a profit by reselling or repurposing the gems. Understanding the resale value of your diamonds is more important than knowing their original retail value or the value of the raw materials.Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for figuring out the fair market value (resale value) of diamond jewelry. There are many factors involved, including the quality of the diamonds, the overall condition of the jewelry, and the subjective appeal of the piece – i.e., is the piece fashionable and attractive?
In general, you will probably have to settle on a price much lower than the retail value of your diamond jewelry. For example, most dealers who specialize in estate jewelry will pay around 10-20% of the current retail value for your jewelry., Scout around on sites like eBay, Etsy, or I Do…Now I Don’t to get an idea of how much sellers are getting for reselling diamonds of similar size and quality and in similar settings to yours.When searching for similar items, include information about the quality of the diamond (color, clarity, carat and cut), the type of setting (ring vs. necklace, etc.), and the material used for the setting (e.g. 14k yellow gold).
Make note of the range of prices for similar pieces that you find, from low to high.

, Based on your appraisal and research, decide on a realistic price range for your diamonds. Set the absolute minimum price for which you are willing to part with your diamonds.


For example, if you found similar pieces ranging in price from $399-$1000, you could set your minimum price around $400.
If you decide to sell your piece on an auction site like eBay, you can set a reserve price (a hidden minimum price requirement) or sell for a fixed price.

, If you’d like to sell your diamond jewelry in a hurry, this is probably your best bet. Check out your potential buyer’s Better Business Bureau ratings or find out if they are registered members of a gem society that promotes ethical practices (like the American Gem Society).While selling your diamonds to a dealer is a quick and easy option, you are unlikely to get the best price this way. Jewelry dealers will want to resell your piece, and will probably need to pay less than market value in order to make a profit.

, Consignment dealers tend to offer better prices than other jewelry dealers. Rather than buying your diamonds from you, they will sell your piece for you and take a percentage of the sale price. So the higher the price they manage to get for you, the more money they make.Look for a consignment dealer who specializes in gems or estate jewelry.
Make sure you find a dealer with good references and reviews. Selling through a consignment dealer usually involves handing your jewelry over to the dealer so that they can sell it for you, so you need to find someone you can trust.
Most consignment dealers will take a 25-40% commission on whatever price they get for your diamond., People who buy gems and jewelry for personal use are likely to offer better prices than dealers and industry insiders. There are a number of options for selling your diamonds directly to public buyers online, including auction sites like eBay, general online classifieds sites like Craigslist, craft sites like Etsy, or specialist sites like I Do…Now I Don’t.Some sites will take a commission on the sale of your jewelry, or charge a small fee for listing your item. Make sure you review and understand each site’s policies before deciding where to sell your diamonds.
If you’d rather not sell your diamonds online, consider selling them through the classifieds section in your local newspaper.

Select an era or a theme to collect by.,
Have a deep pocket and/or a good eye for a bargain.,
Look for solid timber pieces.,
Look for blemishes that will devalue the item.,
Avoid crazed items.,
Clean the pokerwork gently.,
Display well.",How to Start Collecting Pokerwork," Collections are always more successful if you direct your attention to a specific aspect, such as an era, a theme, a style, etc. The era that interests you will likely be dependent on the country of origin as well, as you will need to account for country variations and interests during particular decades but the Victorian era is well known for its pokerwork pieces.A Look Into the Past of The Art of ""Pyr"" Themes can include animals, plants, activity scenes, landscapes, country-specific, etc. Do some library and online research to get an idea of what you prefer. For some people, narrowing it down in this way isn't ideal and there are no hard and fast rules to prevent you from just buying pieces that you like!;
, Good, exhibition-worthy furniture or large pieces of pokerwork will cost around AUD $2,000 - $5,000. If you're still keen but don't have these amounts to spend, keep an eye out in antique stores for smaller pieces that were once cluttering the lounge and sitting rooms of many an average family. Pieces such as memento boxes, paperweights, bookends, vases, plates, etc., can be found anywhere in the range from AUD $50 - $300., When you are looking for good quality and value, whole timber pieces are worth more and retain their value better than plywood pieces., When checking out items of interest, look for chips, grazes, missing pieces, etc. and assess whether any damage devalues the item for your collection. If there is damage but you still want the piece for your collection, seek a heavily reduced price for the item.

, Pokerwork that is crazed is, for the main part, irreparable. The same goes for large cracks.

, Pokerwork that is layered under dust and specks can be easily and safely cleaned using an old toothbrush. Once the toothbrush has removed as much as possible, clean the entire piece with a rag that has been dampened in one part vinegar and two parts grapeseed oil.Wipe off excess liquid and repeat one week later (this gives the oil time to soak in). Adding oil regularly will keep a great shine on your pokerwork items.

, Pokerwork items deserve to be shown off. The ideal storage would be behind glass to prevent dust build-up, although large and elegant pieces are better off being placed in strategic positions around the house as artwork (polish regularly!).

Include a central bead or pendant.,
Experiment with wire wrapping.,
Use a different type of base.",How to Make Bead Earrings2," Instead of making your earrings with a sequence of small beads only, you can use a larger decorative bead or a pendant as a way to make your earrings stand out more. Try putting one large, interesting bead near the bottom or center of your earrings, or attach a pendant to the bottom of your endpin.









You can find endpins that have a rounded wire end, which is useful for hanging pendants from.
Unless the pendant already has a jump ring attached, you will need to get some jump rings to attach the pendant. These are small metal ring that you open and close with pliers to attach them to the wire endpin.

, Wire wrapping is a jewelry making technique that can make your hand-crafted earrings look even more intricate and beautiful. You can use pliers to wire wrap large beads and stones, which you can use as a pendant for earrings.









This technique takes some practice and patience to learn, so plan on doing some experimental pieces before you are ready to make earrings.

, Endpins are the classic type of earring base that jewelers use for earrings, but you can also use other types of bases to give your beaded earrings a different design. See what types of earring bases are available at your local crafting store and do some experimentation.


For example, if you want your earrings to have more movement, then you could use some fishing line as the base for your beads instead.Or, you may be able to find some hoop earrings that are thin enough to slide your beads onto.

Handle them carefully.,
Don't handle the paper with unwashed hands.,
Always handle your rare maps a manuscripts with two (clean) hands and never handle them by the edges, particularly if tears are already evident.

,
Prepare a clean viewing surface on which to enjoy your collection, with no liquids, foods, ink pens or other messy objects nearby.

,
Avoid any use of paper clips, staples post-it notes or other potentially damaging stationery items.

,
Don't store your collection in a space where there are extreme changes in temperature or humidity.,
Avoid anywhere frequented by insects or rodents!

,
Maps and manuscripts should generally be stored flat, either in a shallow drawer or acid-free box.,
If the artifact is too large to store flat, then carefully roll it into a large diameter tube.,
Keep your maps and manuscripts away from strong direct or reflected sunlight, as this will fade the colors and worsen the deterioration of the paper.,
Don't display your collection in spaces prone to damp - say, a bathroom or basement or outside surface - as excess humidity will also damage the paper.

,
To frame your maps or manuscripts, it is better to employ someone who is trained in proper framing techniques.

,
Proper framing should be superficially artistic - after all, your collection is supposed to be enjoyed!,
Be sure that the frame is sealed, and that materials included in your frame are of the highest quality.,
The frame of your map or manuscript should be periodically inspected for any problems which can damage the artifact.

,
Make sure that the dust cover is intact, and that the bumpers and hanging mechanisms of the frame are secure.",How to Protect Your Rare Maps and Manuscripts," A lack of care when handling old manuscripts is the most prevalent cause of their damage, often resulting in wear and tears, worn-out images, creases and stains.;
, Oils and salts in your perspiration may damage the paper and leave difficult stains.

,,,, Each of these can have a detrimental effect on the paper. Ideally, your storage space should have a maintained humidity of 35-55 percent, with a temperature of 60-75 degrees.

,, Here, each piece should be stored in a folder or sleeve made from 100% acid-free paper.

, Again, the tube should be constructed from acid-free materials, or protected with Mylar.

, Fluorescent lights are also harmful, and UV filters should be used wherever possible.

,,, - but it is most important that it protects your collectibles.

, Look out for features such as 100% acid free conservation mat boards, reversible-mounting adhesives, and ultraviolet light filtering glazing.

,, Check for signs of mildew and insects, and fading or yellowing of the paper.

Develop contacts in the art world.,
Be completely committed to art and your desire to start an art gallery.,
Decide what type of art you want to sell and who your clientele will be.,
Put together a detailed business plan.,
Look for funding, if it is not already provided.,
Get commitments from artists.,
Obtain a gallery space in a popular, or easy to find, location.,
Hire trusted employees.,
Get good insurance and a security system for your gallery.,
Do not quit your job immediately.,
Create an online presence.,
Host regular art gallery shows, with well-promoted openings.,
Create a bookkeeping system to track sales, new acquisitions and artist percentages.,
Consider advertising in few local and nation-wide art magazines and buying booths at fine art fairs.,
Be prepared to cater to 2 or more kinds of clientele.,
Be approachable.",How to Run an Art Gallery," These contacts should be amongst art collectors, artists and art media in the town where your gallery will open, and beyond. This can take years (5 to 15) to cultivate through art school, art jobs and socializing in a gallery or museum setting.;
, In the modern marketplace, many gallerists believe you must love what you do in order to be successful. Art sales are inconsistent, with some months providing almost no income and others providing a lot.

, For example, contemporary, abstract, western, sculptors, prints, furniture or a mixture of different types. The gallery's art should be varied but have a driving theme behind your artistic decisions that attracts people to be repeat customers.


You can choose to be a non-profit gallery and gather donations to run a charity. You can choose to form an artists' collective gallery, if you are an artist yourself. You can also choose to run a commercial art gallery that caters to low, middle or high price points. This should be decided before you start to look for artists or look for funding.

, A business plan sets up the foundation of creating a successful, profitable business in 1 to 5 years, and it should include detailed steps on the artist plan, marketing plan and funding needed.

, Your business plan, financial statements and commitment from artists will serve as ways to convince banks or business partners that you have a profitable plan. If you take on business partners, try to choose ones that are likewise linked to the art world and can send collectors your way.

, Look for your artists by getting advice from other dealers or museum curators, or you can put out an open call for submissions. Negotiate your percentage in writing, understanding that generally the newer the artist is to the art world, the higher a percentage of the sale you will be able to receive.

, Often this means that gallery space is expensive, so be ready to pay a high rent to stay where out-of-town visitors and collectors can easily find you. A well-situated space will also prove beneficial for marketing gallery show openings.

, Gallery employees should have an art education, contacts in the art world and have sales, business or marketing experience. The ideal employee has an art history or art administration degree and is prepared to multi-task, especially at the beginning.

, This is essential so that you can be protected in case of theft or other damage. Artists will often require proof of insurance before agreeing to keep their work in your gallery.

, Many gallerists, especially in big cities, run their gallery along with other jobs until their gallery becomes profitable. Appoint a trusted, knowledgeable employee to oversee the gallery when you cannot be there, and work hard to move comfortably into working there full-time.

, Today's galleries must have a website, social media accounts, blogs and an email list in order to be successful and get new clientele. Invest money in having an attractive website that lists your artists, some art, your location and contact information.

, Use your contacts in the art world to plan, market and execute shows that are attended by your clientele. Market using email blasts, art magazine ads, newspaper features, social media and printed invitations.

, You may be able to do this with software, if you are a small gallery, or you may need to hire a freelance or part-time accountant.

, Booths and ad space help to establish good relationships in the art world and they expose you to new clientele. Advertising in art magazines, although expensive, may allow you to ask for monthly or annual features on your gallery shows.

, Keep a list of frequent collectors who are given the first chance to buy new art or who can ask for special commissions. Also, market prints or less expensive art to visitors or younger collectors.

, You never know who is or is not a collector when they walk through your door. Make sure you are not snooty, and you give a good impression to all potential clients.

Give your frequent supporters special perks and rewards.,
Set up frequent lunch or dinner appointments with potential and current prospects.",How to Sell Art," Distribute these items around local art galleries and fairs.


Ask local vendors if you can leave some of your business cards with them or post a flier on their community bulletin boards. Consider contacting vendors that would have the appropriate clientele for your artwork.
Also advertise at local restaurants and stores. This will will allow you to catch people of all interests.;
, Those that are closest to you are your biggest advocates. Let your friends, family and co-workers know that you are selling your art.


Show them some of your favorite pieces so they can pass on first-hand information about your art for sale. Be sure to also give them some of your promotional materials so they can hand out your contact information.

, Most communities host a variety of art fairs throughout the year. Research the various options and decide which one, or ones, would be most appropriate for the type of art you are selling.


For example, if you intend on selling paintings, go to one which highlights paintings in particular.
Keep in mind that it often costs money to have a booth at these fairs, but consider the fee an investment in your business. Putting up a little money will likely pay off once you sell a few of your pieces.

, If you know some people who may be intrigued by your work, host a small get together at your house or at one of their houses.


You can also host a private showing to only a handful of guests. Some people are more likely to attend an intimate event like this than an art fair. Ask all of those invited to bring a guest and, again, you are broadening your client base just by word of mouth.

, Art galleries host events to show off new artists' artwork that can help you get your name into the art world.


Local galleries enjoy loyal and steady art lovers, making them ideal places to build a following. Even if you don't grab the attention of important art folk, you'll be spreading your name to those who may know said important art folk.These galleries also tend to have an established network of art promoters who love to support budding artists. Because they are often small, they tend to pay special attention to individual artists. They also will focus on bringing in interested collectors, practically advertising your work for you.While galleries are great, know that you aren't limited to them to showcase your work. Cafes, office lobbies, schools, and other places of business often host mini exhibitions from local talent.This is a great way of exposing your art to casual art fans; remember, not everyone goes to art galleries, but they do grab the occasional coffee.
You'll most likely have to share a portion of the profit with the gallery. They are helping market your name, which does come with a price. Don't worry; this is a small price to pay for getting to share your work.

, Showing support to your peers may prove invaluable when the time comes to host your own exhibit. It will also expose you to unique business opportunities and information.


When selling your art, remember it's all about who you know. Most cities have a local art council who promote and manage art events and exhibitions. These councils are known to give out funding to local talent, asking artists to partake in community projects or other such tasks.Your arts community may also have a website that posts regular job opportunities or small-scale commissions. They may also promote local exhibitions and shows. Stay current with these local channels to find lucrative opportunities.

, Aside from art lovers and promoters, some businesses also love to be seen supporting the arts.It's not uncommon for artists to be brought up at a networking event. Try attending these events held by local businesses and distribute your business cards there. You may get contacted later with an interesting project.
A business may also need help decorating offices, or require art prizes for their raffles. If you market yourself enough, you may also find yourself designing for websites and products that need to portray a certain image., Inform your local press about your exhibitions and inquire about whom you need to contact to get an editorial feature in your local paper.


Local media love to feature profiles of unique characters from the area.Since artists are often associated with terms like ""unique"" and ""special,"" it will make sense for reporters and bloggers to cover you for a story.
Every time you have an exhibition, you've won an art contest, or you've completed a new project, send out a little press release to the local media. You could even offer them free tickets to your exhibition.
Don't be intimidated by the media. They're just normal people like you and me, and they may be eager to highlight up-and-coming talent. Being featured in local media will help you remain front-and-center in the local community's gaze.

, Having your name associated to charitable, non-profit efforts may establish you as a trustworthy, recognizable name in your community. This will open you up to profitable opportunities.


Find a charity whose work truly inspires you and that you connect with. For example, if you love to paint dogs, get in touch with an animal shelter. Contact them and offer to work on their next event, free of charge. You could donate art to their raffle or offer to decorate their places of business.
Most local charities already have a relationship with the media. Helping isn't just a nice deed, it may result in you being written up in the media as well. Giving back to the community is essential for building a loyal fan base that will continue buying and supporting your art.In November 2013, the Philippines was hit by a devastating typhoon in which millions of homes were destroyed. Wells Fargo began a charitable campaign in which they would donate $3 for every traced and decorated hand print they received. Many local artists took this opportunity to show their support and highlight their art in an altruistic manner., In the digital age, most business transactions are moving from the street to the computer. Visit the following websites for showcasing your art easily and with little cost.


Artpal.com is a free gallery for selling art. Their advertised products range from sculptures to jewelry, catering to a wide spectrum of artists. Artpal offers free membership, has a user-friendly website, and offers many features for selling your art online.Advertise your art on popular online merchants like Amazon or eBay. You'll only have to pay a shipping fee, and you'll get to appeal to a wide range of consumers. If enough people buy your work, your items may be linked to other popular items and listed as ""People who bought this, also bought...""
Make an offer on Craigslist.com. Craigslist advertises a broad range of things, from job opportunities to used electronics. Showcasing and selling your pieces to casual consumers will help you build confidence and turn a profit as you seek to gain exposure locally.

, Selling art means becoming a business in-and-of yourself. Now that you've built a small following, give your fans a place where they can learn more about you and your work.


Use social media like Facebook or Twitter to link people back to your website. This way, your followers will know you can always be contacted at this place regardless of what online trends come and go.

, Now that you've sold or showcased your work, establish a means of maintaining communication with important art folk.


Your database of supporters and investors can be your most powerful marketing tool. Make sure you have ways to inform them of your upcoming exhibitions. Acquire phone numbers, email addresses, and mailing addresses as well.

Avoid selling your art through other channels if you have already worked out a deal with an art gallery. Many art galleries are hesitant to even share their contact info in the first place because they fear that artists will sell behind their backs.Be persistent when attempting to contact new prospects. It may take many attempts before you find someone willing to sell your art.

, Every time you make new artwork or hold an exhibition, notify your mailing list.


Be sure you ask for permission to contact to your clientele. You want to provide them with meaningful updates, not unwanted spam.
Contact customers personally whenever you have new artworks available, or when someone has bought a piece from you. Send letters expressing gratitude for purchasing your art. Remember, someone who has bought your art has expressed sincere interest and has made an investment in you. Failing to maintain contact with customers beyond the first transaction can come off as rude and dismissive.

, Once you've got a steady following, determine who the constant supporters are among your fans. Offer them special treatment like opportunities to connect with you and first shots at purchasing your work.


If you paint murals, offer a small, free portrait of your fan's face. If you make t-shirts, give away free t-shirts in the mail. Show your supporters that your passion for art extends beyond money, and they might reciprocate this notion.
Repeat customers are the foundation of a loyal fan base. They've already proven that they want to support you, and that they value your work. Show them that you appreciate their support and interest by giving them special treatment not offered to most followers.Remember, your best customers aren't limited to a set group of individuals. This number will inevitably grow as your following does. Don't be stingy with special perks; you want to keep as many people coming back for more.

, Establishing social relationships with your investors beyond the art and business world is as important as building a loyal fan base.


Allow your investors to get to know you on a personal level. Sometimes, becoming familiar with an artist's personality sheds interesting insight on that artist's work.
Don't be afraid to recommend your fellow art peers to investors. Who knows, maybe those artists will return the favor and recommend you in the future.

Follow the instruction manual.,
Consider having an extended warranty or to purchase a metal detector with a lifetime warranty.,
Shield your metal detector by keeping it in a case, box or thick bag when not in use.,
Protect the monitor, toggle switches, battery access cover and knobs by making a little hood using cardboard and duct tape.,
Do regular checks of the coil and headset wires at their connection points and protect the copper prongs at the wire ends.,
Be careful with the wire connections to: a) the coil, b) the headset to the main body of your detector and c) the coil wire to the main body of your detector.. Do not put pressure on the connectors when assembling and disassembling your detector.,
Transport the headphones in a cloth bag.,
Protect your detector from the elements.",How to Take Care of Your Metal Detector," Keep the manual, do not discard it. Download the manual from the internet for ease of viewing. Also, heed the advice of others who own metal detectors on the care of metal detectors, as they will have some good advice for you.;
, Know what the warranty covers, for example, most warranties won't usually cover accidents and neglect.

, Buy a case or make a duffel type bag. Make a custom cardboard box, for your detector: you will need cardboard, paper glue, a box cutter, tape measure and tape


If you disassemble your metal detector when not using it, always remove the coil from the non-metal rod.
If you always have your metal detector fully assembled, keep it safe from damage - the metal detector is a somewhat fragile device because it is made from lightweight materials. At home, store your detector(s) so they will be safe, such as on a rack.

, Make your protective hood easy to remove and apply, by using a cord to attach the hood (like a chin strap for a helmet). A hood is space efficient, but if space is not a problem, use plastic foam sheets or cushioned fabric and wrap it like a bandage around the metal detector's main housing.

,


When using your detector, periodically check that the wires, if removable, are securely connected. Do not let dust, dirt, sand, water and especially salt water get into areas hard to clean. Check the wires so there are not excessive stressed at their connections. The headset wire and connection is not too robust, do not stress it.
If your wires, when not assembled, have delicate prongs, protect these prongs from breaking by using the prong shields that came with your detector.

, When metal detecting, be aware of any stress at the wire connections, and if there is stress, immediately adjust the wire wrapping on the pole.

, Use one that is light and well cushioned. At the very least, store your headphones in a doubled-up plastic bag.

, Unless you have a waterproof metal detector, buy a clear plastic hood or use a clear plastic bag for protection from water, sand and dust when necessary. When laying down your metal detector, keep it away from sand and dirt.

Determine whether your book is valuable:


A book’s value is determined by a combination of five factors: rarity, importance, condition, provenance, and desirability.,
Get a second opinion from a professional appraiser or an auction house is also a good idea.,
2.,
Sell the book


How should you sell your book?",How to Sell Rare Books,"
Let’s look at these one at a time. Rarity means how many copies of your book are available. The fewer copies of your book are available, the rarer it is, and the more valuable it will probably be.
Importance means, was your book an influential piece of literature, or a ground-breaking work of science, or a text that changed history? The more important your book is, the more valuable it may be. First editions of important books can be very valuable.
Condition refers to whether or not a book is in good shape. No parts should be damaged or missing.
Provenance refers to who owned the book before you. If your copy of the book has a special history or inscription, that can increase its value.
Desirability just means, will someone want to buy your book? Is there a market for it?
Most rare book dealers will look at your book and offer a free evaluation. If you aren't able to visit a book dealer in person, you can probably email them pictures and a description of the book and still receive a reasonably accurate appraisal.;
, These services may take more time and have some fees associated with them, however.

, Determine your book's value


Let’s say your book is definitely rare, and valuable, and you want to sell it. Next you have to figure out just how much it’s worth. Putting the right price on a book can be tricky: make the price too high, and no one will want to buy your book. Make the price too low, and you may feel like you haven’t received your book’s full worth.
Auction records are a good place to start to determine a rare book’s value. You may be able to do some of this research on your own.
Speaking to a good book dealer is probably your most reliable option for putting a price on your rare book.
Professional dealers usually have subscriptions to databases like the American Book Prices Current and Americana Exchange, which allow them to find the prices that books have realized at auctions during the past 30 years.
After examining your book, looking at the five factors discussed in part one, studying the auction records, and drawing on their own experience, a good book dealer should offer you a fair value for your book.
Confirming the evaluation with a major auction house like Christie’s or Sotheby’s is always a good idea. Search online to find either website.
Don’t look only at prices on sites like eBay or Abebooks! You can certainly find many fairly priced rare books on those sites, and they’re not a bad place to start your research. But people with little to no expertise can list books here at whatever price they want, so don’t treat these sites as reliable sources of book prices.

, A professional book dealer is probably still your best option for selling a rare book. Once you agree on a price, the book dealer will buy your book from you without any additional fees or wait time.
Auction houses are also an option. A book may sometimes realize a higher price at auction than it would in a private sale. But auctions are unpredictable and prices can’t be guaranteed. In addition, the auction process takes longer.
You can also sell the book yourself on sites like eBay or Abebooks. However, if you don’t have a long history and a reliable profile on these sites, your book may not attract the buyers you want. As a result, your book could sell for less than you think it’s worth.

Talk about the materials used.,
Identify the style of art.,
Consider the content.,
Familiarize yourself with common descriptive terms.,
Check the time period of the piece.",How to Talk About Art1," A variety of different materials can be used to make art and each of these materials will create a different visual effect. For example, sculptors can use stone, marble, wire or wood to create their art. Similarly, painters can use watercolours, oil, chalk, and pencil. When you are looking at art, comment on the materials or medium used to create the image. If you can't identify them, look at the label., In order to sound knowledgeable while discussing art, learn to identify the style of art. For example, some common and recognizable styles include abstract, realist, expressionist, surrealist, or impressionist. A piece of art that uses realism can be easily identified because the artist attempts to create an image that looks real, almost like a photograph.Alternatively, an abstract piece of art does not attempt to mimic reality and instead, can include random splatters of paint or lines to create a thought provoking image.
Familiarize yourself with the different styles by searching online for images of the different styles of art. For example, search for ""impressionist images.""
Visit museums, which often group art by style. You may find yourself in a room of surrealist paintings, for instance.

, The style of art can also be described by looking at the content of the image. For example, learn the differences between portraits (image of a person), landscapes (image of a place), or still life (image of an object) works of art., It is also a good idea to know some descriptive words that you can use while describing art. You can use them to describe the mood of the painting, as you perceive it:Dynamic
Intimate
Suggestive
Challenging

, You may have heard of renaissance art, modern art, or cubism before. These are a few different time periods and movements within art history. To talk about a work of art, check its time period. Consider how the historic moment impacted the way that art was created.


Consider the movements that were happening at that time. For example, Cubism was a type of modern art that was developed in the early twentieth century. Artists, such as Picasso, departed from the romantic and realistic artwork of the late nineteenth century and began creating more abstract images.Think about any major world events, such as war, that may be reflected in the piece.
Consider what was taboo at the time and place the art was made. Works that may not seem shocking now might have been, then, or vice versa.

"
"
Talk about the composition and placement.,
Comment on the lines and brush strokes.,
Notice the colors and contrast.",How to Talk About Art2," Composition refers to the ways in which objects or shapes are arranged within a work of art. For instance, shapes may be placed near each other, overlapping, spaced-apart, or arranged in a pattern. This influences the order in which you observe parts of the painting.One way to notice things about the composition is to see where your eyes go naturally when you look at the painting.
For example, you could say “I'm seeing that the artist has painted bright lights around the figure of the baby. It makes it really hard to look away from that corner of the painting.”, In some paintings, you will be able to clearly see the brushstrokes and technique on the canvas. You can comment on the way the brush strokes catch your eye and give texture to the image. At other times paintings can look smooth, almost like a photograph. In this case, the artist is likely going for a real life effect.You could say ""This piece looks just like a photograph. How does the artist create such smooth lines?""
Alternately, you may notice really thick brushstrokes or blobs of paint. You can comment on the sculptural thickness of layered paint.

, Colour is another important element in art and can be used to capture your attention. Colours can create a contrast between light and dark, or complement each other in a visually stimulating way. When talking about art, discuss how the color makes you feel, and what you think it communicates.For instance, you could say ""the light and dark contrast in this image makes a sharp distinction between good and evil in this piece.""
You can comment on the feeling of the painting that the color communicates: ""This bright piercing blue invokes so much joy, yet the muted red tones of the background feel more like a warning.""

"
"
Avoid delivering unnecessary judgements.,
Ask questions.,
Acknowledge that you are not an expert.,
Talk about how the art makes you feel.",How to Talk About Art3," Art is very personal and it is not always meant to make you feel good. As a result, you may offend people by giving harsh criticism. Instead, you can comment on the art itself, without saying whether or not you like it. This allows you to comment on the work without giving your personal feelings.Avoid saying things like ""I could make that."" This type of comment is insulting to the artist and does not promote artistic conversation.
If you do dislike a piece, you can explain that it's due to your personal taste. For instance, you can say, ""I can see this is well composed. I have trouble looking at this image, though, because it's so dynamic it almost feels violent.”

, A great way to assess a piece of art is by asking questions. If you're going to talk about art, questions are a great way to learn from your companions and promote conversation.Ask if your companion knows much about the artist or the art movement in question.
Get the opinion of your companion about a piece.

, If you are visiting an art gallery with a group of friends or colleagues and you do not know much about the kind of art you're viewing, feel free to admit to confusion at any point. Some people in your group may actually be relieved to discover that they are not the only person outside of their comfort zone.Pretending to know a lot will be awkward, and isn't necessary.
You might say, ""Wow, I can tell a lot is going on here, but I don't know where to start.""

, The most important thing when you are thinking and talking about art is that it makes you feel something, even if that feeling is unpleasant. Comment on how the piece makes you feel and why. Sometimes the artist will intentionally want the audience to feel uncomfortable. This does not mean you need to judge the quality of work, just the impression that the piece has left on you.For example, you may feel inspired, sad, happy, confused, uncomfortable, angry, etc.

"
"
Take a long look at the piece of art.,
Read the title and description of the piece.,
Read up on the artist.",How to Talk About Art4," Most people only glance at a piece of art. For example, a survey done at the Louvre found that the average person spends 15 seconds looking at the Mona Lisa. This is not enough time to truly engage with a work of art. Try to spend at least a minute, preferably longer, looking at a piece of art. This will allow you to take in the image, look at the detail of the composition, and determine how you feel about the piece. By spending time looking at art, you will more likely be able to talk about the piece and some of the finer details.If you are able to stare at a work of art for long periods of time, you may begin to create a dialogue with the piece. This can be extremely interesting, as you begin to see how the picture speaks to you.

, Art galleries and museums will often place a small plaque near each piece to give the title and a small description. This can sometimes provide you with details to help you interpret and discuss the art. For example, you may see a knot of light pink lines and feel confused. Upon reading the plaque you learn that the title of the work is “My Struggle with Breast Cancer.” The title of this piece may help you better understand what is being communicated through the art.


Plaques can also include detailed information about the materials used, date that it was created, etc.

, Some galleries will also provide detailed information about the artists. This material may be found in a pamphlet or in a small biography near the artwork. Learning about the artist may help you understand a bit about their interests and what inspired them to create this art. This will give you more to discuss about the art.

Use an old toothbrush to wash away clay or dirt.,
Soak the crystals in vinegar and washing ammonium to remove lime carbonates, calcite, and barite.,
Use a diamond edge saw to cut off excess material.,
Use water, household cleaners, and bleach.,
Try oxalic acid for harshly stained crystals.,
Be careful when handling acid.,
Rinse the crystals.,
Obtain the correct materials.,
Wear safety goggles, gloves, and an air mask.,
Work over the quartz with 50 grade sandpaper.,
Continue sanding the stone with 150 grade sandpaper, and then move on to the finest grade sand paper.,
Clean and rub the stone with a soft cloth.",How to Polish Quartz Crystals," You can do some initial cleaning of your crystals with a toothbrush and water. Make sure you wash the crystals outdoors, as clay and dirt from the crystals can clog a sink.Scrub the crystal to remove set in clay. You will have to do several rounds of cleaning, allowing the crystals to dry in between rounds. Once the crystals dry, the clay cracks and becomes easier to remove.
If clay is particularly stuck on, try spraying the crystals down with a hose with the nozzle set at maximum force. As with using a toothbrush, you will have to do this several times a day, allowing the crystals to dry in between sessions.;
, Crystals may be stained with lime carbonates, calcite, and barite, causing discoloration. You can use vinegar and a household cleaner to remove these stains.Submerge the crystals in enough full-strength vinegar to cover all the crystals. Leave the crystals for 8 to 12 hours.
Remove the crystals from the vinegar. Soak them in washing ammonium for an equal amount of time. Then, remove the crystals from the ammonium, rinse them completely, and wipe them dry.
You may have to repeat this process several times if the stains persist after the crystals are first soaked.

, There may still be some unwanted material on the quartz. You may also notice uneven edges. You can trim these materials using a diamond edged saw, which you can purchase at a local hardware store. Diamond edged saws can be expensive, however, so you may want to try borrowing the product from a friend or renting one.Lubricate the crystal with a light layer of mineral oil before you begin.
There is no need to saw the crystal or press down on the saw. You simply need to place the crystal under the saw and allow the machine to gradually saw through the crystal.
Trim away any unwanted portions of the crystal. There may be areas with stains that would not come out, for example, which you should remove with the saw.

, The easiest and safest way to soak crystals to remove stains is using a combination of water and laundry detergent. You can then soak the crystals in bleach overnight. If your crystals have minimal stains, it's best to soak them overnight in a combination of water and household dish soap or laundry detergent.Use a combination of warm water and laundry detergent to wash the crystals. You can use a soft rag to scrub any dirt and debris that comes off easily.
From here, find a container you can cover easily, like a sturdy Tupperware container. Fill this container with warm water and 1/4 cup of bleach. Place the gems in the bleach, cover the container, and set aside in a safe place for two days.

, If your crystals have a lot of stains beyond regular dirt and grime, such as discolorations caused by iron, oxalic acid may be necessary to properly treat the gems. Oxalic acid is also known as wood bleach, and you can purchase it online or at a hardware store. Purchase a one pound bag of oxalic acid, and get a gallon container. Make sure the material the container is made out of will not corrode in response to acid. Metal containers cannot hold oxalic acid.Fill the container three fourths of the way full with distilled water. Then, pour in the oxalic acid. Wear an air mask to avoid inhaling the acid. You also want to make sure you work outside.
Stir the acid, using a large rod or spoon, until the oxalic acid crystals are dissolved. Add the crystal quartz. There is no set time to soak quartz in oxalic acid. Depending on the staining, it can take a few days to a few hours. Check the quartz periodically and remove them when the stains are gone.

, You need to take extreme precaution if you choose to handle oxalic acid. Only do so if your quartz are very stained. It is always safer to use bleach and water. If you choose to use oxalic acid, adhere to the following safety precautions:Wear eye protection, gloves, and a face mask when handling oxalic acid.
Always pour acid into water. It is very dangerous to pour water into acid.
Get a friend or family member to help you.
Make sure to protect your work area and go slowly to avoid spills. Baking soda can neutralize acid spills, so have some baking soda on-hand.

, Once you've soaked the crystals to remove the stains, you can now rinse the crystals. Make sure to use gloves for this process and, if you were working with oxalic acid, a face mask and eye protection. Wash away any excess bleach or acid with warm water. This should also help remove any remaining dirt., Once the crystals are clean and free of any stains, you should sand them down so they're soft and shiny. To do so, you'll need to gather certain materials. Stop by your local hardware store and pick up the following:50 grade sandpaper
150 grade sandpaper
300 to 600 grade sandpaper

, When sanding crystal, dust and powder may come off the gem. This can cause irritation of the nose, mouth, and eyes. Make sure you wear safety googles, gloves, and an air mask when polishing your quartz., To start, you'll want to use your mildest sandpaper. Gently work the sandpaper over the surface of the crystal.Make sure you go for consistency. You do not want any portions of the gem to be more or less sanded than others.

, You'll want to work up to finer and finer grades of sand paper. Once you finish with the 50 grade sandpaper, rub the crystal down with 150 grade sandpaper. From there, move on to the 300 to 600 grade sand paper.Once again, rub the stone gently through its entire surface.
Make sure to smooth away any blemishes or discolorations on the stone.
When you're done, your crystal should like bright, clear, and shiny.

, After sanding down the stone, you can use a soft cloth to give it an added gleam. Gently rub the stone clean with somewhat damp cloth. Get rid of any lingering dust from the sanding process, then set the stone aside to dry. You should have a clean, polished quartz crystal."

Weigh the gold.,
Measure the size.,
Calculate the density of your gold.,
Check for a stamp.,
Look for discoloration.",How to Spot Fake Gold1," Gold is a very dense metal, so it will be heavier than it looks. Use a jeweler’s scale to determine the exact weight of the gold.Gold bullions typically have their weight inscribed on them. Make sure the actual weight matches this inscription.
Many gold coins and pieces will also have their weight stamped on them. Check that the weight is accurate.;
, Gold should be small compared to its weight. Fake gold pieces may have a heavier weight but also be too large for the weight to match the weight of real gold.


Check the diameter and thickness of any gold coins you’re considering buying. The specifications for collectible coins can be found in numismatic guides or online.
Gold bars are sold in many different sizes, but the size of a standard gold bar is 7”x 3 ⅝” x 1 ¾” and weighs 400 ounces or 27.5 pounds.
Determine the actual volume of irregular objects, such as rings, by placing them in a graduated cylinder accurate to .1 milliliters(mLs). Place 20mLs of water in the cylinder and add the object you wish to test. Record the difference in water level. 1 cubic centimeter is equal to 1 mL.

, Density is a measurement of mass per volume. Once you know the weight of the gold and its volume, you can easily calculate density by dividing the mass by the volume.24 karat gold has a density of 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter.
18 karat gold has a density of 15.6 grams per cubic centimeter.
14 karat gold has a density of 13.1 grams per cubic centimeter.

, Gold will be stamped with the karat weight or purity of the gold as well as the manufacturer’s name. The stamp will typically be on the clasps of jewelry.Typical karat markings are 10K, 14K, and 24K
Some counterfeit gold will have a karat stamp on it, but rarely have a manufacturer’s name.

, As a precious metal, gold does not tarnish or rust. If you see any discoloration on the metal, it is a sure sign that it is not pure gold.If your skin becomes discolored or greenish when wearing golden jewelry it is likely a bronze mixed with copper. Pure gold does not cause a reaction when worn against the skin for extended times.

"
"
Place your gold jewelry, gold powder or nugget inside of a crucible.,
Place the crucible on a fireproof surface.

,
Aim an acetylene torch at the gold.,
Pick up the crucible using crucible tongs.

,
Separate the gold into small pieces and allow them to harden.,
Choose the appropriate container.,
Wear protective gear.,
Place the container outdoors in a well-ventilated area.,
Pour 30 milliliters of nitric acid for every ounce of gold into your container.,
Add 120 milliliters of hydrochloric acid or muriatic acid for every ounce of gold in the container.,
Pour the acid into another larger container.,
Heat 1 quart of water and add 1 pound of urea to the water.,
Gradually add the water/urea mixture to the acid.,
Add a selective gold precipitant to 1 quart of boiling water following the manufacturer’s instructions.,
Add the water/precipitant solution slowly to the acid.,
Immerse a stirring stick into the acid solution.

,
Place a drop of the solution onto the end of a paper towel.

,
Place a drop of precious metal detection liquid on the spot of acid.,
Pour the acid into a clean container as soon as the acid is clear of dissolved gold particles.,
Add tap water to the mud remaining in your container.,
Pour the water into the container into which you poured the acid.

,
Rinse the gold mud again 3 to 4 times with water and pour off the excess water.

,
Rinse the gold with aqua ammonia.,
Rinse the ammonia from the mud with distilled water.

,
Pour the mud into a large beaker.,
Place your beaker onto a hot plate.,
Continue heating the mud until it develops a powder-like consistency.

,
Pour the mud onto multiple layers of paper towels.,
Place the mud into a graphite crucible and melt it.,
Pour the gold into an ingot mold.",How to Refine Gold," Most crucibles are made of graphite, which enables them to withstand the melting of the material inside.;
,, Aim the flame at the gold until the gold is completely melted.

,, This is called “making shot.” If you are refining small pieces of jewelry like rings, then you can simply melt the piece without making shot particles.

,


For every ounce of gold that you want to refine, you will need 300 milliliters in container capacity.
Use containers large heavy-gauge plastic buckets or Pyrex Vision Ware pots.

,


Put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands from the acid. Wear the gloves as you handle any of the chemicals mentioned in this article.
Wear a rubber apron to protect your clothing.
Wear goggles to protect your eyes.
Consider wearing a face mask to prevent the inhalation of noxious fumes.

, The acid reactions in the aqua regia process produce strong and noxious fumes that are extremely dangerous.

, Allow the acid to react with the gold for 30 minutes.

, Allow the solution to sit overnight until all of the acid fumes have been dispelled.

,


Make sure that none of the particles are poured out with the acid as they will contaminate the gold.
The acid should have a clear emerald green color. If the color is murky, then you should probably pour it through a Buchner filter funnel.

, Continue heating the mixture until it boils.

,


The acid mixture will bubble as you add the water and urea. Add the mixture slowly so that it doesn’t cause the acid to bubble out of its container.
The water/urea mixture neutralizes the nitric acid but not hydrochloric acid in your solution.

,


In general, you will add 1 ounce of precipitant per ounce of gold that you are refining.
Avoid putting your face near the container’s opening. The smell is very strong and pungent.

,


The acid will turn a muddy brown color, which is actually caused by the separation of the gold particles.
Wait 30 minutes to allow the precipitant solution to work on the gold particles.

,,, If the spot turns purplish, then you need to give the precipitant more time to work before discarding the acid.

,


The acid should be amber with what looks like mud collected at the bottom of the container.
Do not pour the mud off with the acid. The mud is pure gold.

, Stir the water and allow the mud to settle.

,,, You will see white vapors come off of the gold mud. Make sure to protect your eyes and to avoid inhaling the fumes.

,, Pour off all of the distilled water so that only mud remains.

, Turn the hot plate on and let the beaker heat up gradually so that the thermal shock doesn’t cause it to shatter.

,, Wrap the mud in the towels and soak the mud in alcohol.

, The mud will take on the appearance of metal and will be 99 percent pure if you performed the process correctly.

, You can then take it to a jeweler or to a precious metals dealer to exchange it for cash if you desire.

Determine where prospecting is permitted.,
Study mining records and the geology of mining districts.,
Obtain sufficient capital.,
Train for physical hardship.,
Obtain a high-quality vehicle that can handle many types of terrain.

,
Use the appropriate equipment.",How to Prospect for Gold1," There are a number of rules about prospecting, so make sure you familiarize yourself with the regulations before starting.


Obtain permission from the landowner to prospect on privately owned land.
Avoid national parks, which are all closed to prospecting.
Consult the Forest Service and the United States Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to see if certain parcels of land are open for prospecting. You will find public land records in the appropriate state BLM office.;
, Most gold will be found in areas that have already been prospected and within samples of 3 to 5 pounds of mineralized rock.

, You’ll need funds to travel to the area in which you want to prospect as well as money to support yourself during your prospecting adventure.

, Prospecting isn't for everyone, as you'll need to be fit enough to spend long hours traipsing through the backcountry. Things you might have to contend with:


Carrying a large backpack into the wilderness.
Walking or climbing for long distances.
Traveling at high altitudes on mountainous terrain.

,, You’ll need a variety of tools:


A small prospector’s pick
Extra clothing and boots
A bucket or wheelbarrow to transport materials to the washing site
A compass for establishing claim lines
Adequate maps
A magnifying lens for identifying minerals
Plastic bags to identify samples
Camping supplies including an axe, a flashlight, a knife and matches
A 2-quart or larger canteen and water purification tablets
A miner’s lamp or gasoline or propane lamps
A camping stove for cooking meals
2 pounds of dehydrated or freeze-dried foods per person per day
Sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat
First aid kits and snakebite kits
Lightweight sleeping bag

"
"
Test the magnetism.,
Perform the float test.,
Complete the nitric acid test.",How to Spot Fake Gold2," Gold is not magnetic, however, many metals used to make fake gold are. Get a magnet that is stronger than a typical refrigerator magnet to perform this test.Hold the magnet slightly above the gold piece.
Observe if the gold is attracted to the magnet and if the magnet can pick up the piece of gold.

, You can test whether or not the piece of gold floats to determine if its real. Real gold is dense and will sink, but many pieces of fake gold will float.Get a glass large enough to fit the piece of gold, and fill it with water.
Drop the gold piece into the water, and observe it.

, This is a good test to use on scrap gold, but not recommended for jewelry you plan to wear or resell. This test uses nitric acid to see if the gold has a chemical reaction with it. One hundred percent gold will have no reaction to the nitric acid.Put on safety goggles and gloves before working the the nitric acid.
Make a light, small scratch on the gold using a nail file.
Use an eyedropper to apply one drop of nitric acid to the scratch on the gold.
If the liquid turns greenish, the item is probably mostly another metal like zinc and plated with gold. If the liquid turns a milky color, the item most likely is mostly sterling silver and plated with gold.

"
"
Perform a streak test.,
Test the density of the sample.,
Do a scratch test.",How to Spot Fake Gold3," Rub a sample of the suspected gold or pyrite on an unglazed ceramic tile. A colored streak will be left behind similar to a pencil mark.


Fool's gold or pyrite will leave behind a greyish streak.
Real gold will leave a shiny golden streak.

, Determine the weight and volume of your sample. Use a digital scale to weigh the sample and record the mass in grams. Place the sample in a graduated container filled with water to determine the volume of displaced water. The volume the water level rises will indicate the volume of your sample (1 milliliter is equal to 1 cubic centimeter). Divide the mass by the volume.Pyrite has a density of 4.8-5 grams per cubic centimeter
Pure gold has a density of 19.3 grams per cubic centimeter.

, The hardness of a mineral can be determined by its ability to scratch or be scratched by an object. Try to scratch a copper penny with your suspected gold.


Real gold will not scratch a penny and can be scratched by the penny.
Fool's gold or pyrite will scratch a penny and cannot be scratched by the penny.

"
"
Ask for the item’s melt value.,
Avoid purchases delivered to a “secured location”.,
Know the current market value for gold.,
Purchase certified gold coins.",How to Spot Fake Gold4," Gold jewelry and coins can be melted down to extract the metal from the piece. If you are told that the melt value exceeds the weight of the item, you should be wary of the purchase because it may be a gold plated or counterfeit piece.

, Some business trick consumers into buying gold by saying that the purchase will be stored in a high security location for safety. In many instances the gold product does not actually exist or is of an inferior quality.Always inspect your gold before making a purchase.
Rent or invest in a safety deposit box or safe to protect your gold.

, Gold price is based on its weight. The price of an ounce of gold fluctuates regularly. Reputable dealers will provide you with the current market value of an ounce of gold when making a purchase.


Expect mark-ups when purchasing coins or jewelry to cover the artistic or collectible value of the item.
If the price of an item is below the market price for its weight you should avoid the purchase.

, American Numismatic Association (ANA) provides grading and certification of collectible gold coins. Make sure that any gold coins you purchase have been assessed for grading by the ANA."

Purchase a gold pan.,
Travel to your desired prospecting location and set up camp.,
Fill your pan half to two-thirds full of soil, gravel, and small rocks from the stream channel.

,
Put the pan under water.,
Hold the pan level under water with your hands on either side of it.,
Tilt the pan forward, away from your body and down slightly, still holding it under water.,
Repeat the previous steps until a layer of fine-grain dark material overlain by a small layer of light material remains at the bottom of the pan.

,
Remove the pan from the stream.,
Drain out all water and let the black sand and gold dry.",How to Prospect for Gold2," You can find these online or at a hardware or department store that specializes in mining equipment.


Look for a pan that is 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep, slopes at a 45-degree angle and is at least 15 inches (38.1 cm) in diameter.

, There are a number of places in the United States known for having a rich mineral supply.

,, Break up the lumps of clay and discard any stones.

, Rotate it halfway back and forth rapidly to wash out the clay and to concentrate the heavy material at the bottom of the pan.

, Let the light gravel and sand dribble out of the front, and push the top material and large chunks of rock out with your thumbs.

,, Rotate the pan in a circular motion separating the heavier material from the lighter material. Any gold should remain lagging behind the other material at the bottom of the pan.

,


Lift out black sand with a magnet.
Separate any remaining gold out using tweezers.

,


Look in the Boise Basin, a few miles northeast of Boise in the west-central part of the state.
Check along the Salmon River and the Clearwater River and its tributaries at Elk City, Pierce and Orofino.
Look for fine deposits, or “flour gold,” near the Snake River.

, Look in the Black Hills region, on French Creek near Custer and in the Deadwood area.

,,


Check the northeastern part of the state where the streams drain the Blue and Wallowa Mountains.
Look for gold in Sumpter, on the upper Powder River.
Check the Burnt River and its tributaries.
Look in the John Day River valley.
Check tributaries in southwestern Oregon along tributaries of the Rogue River and streams in the Klamath Mountains.

, Because of the lack of water supply, you may have to use expensive dry or semi-dry concentration methods for obtaining gold.

,


Be aware that most land is privately owned and that prospecting can only be done with prior permission.
Deposits will be low-grade, difficult to recognize and costly to explore and to sample.

"
"
Understand that the odds are against you.,
Look in volcanic and sedimentary rocks.,
Look in granitic rocks.,
Look for gold in metamorphic rocks.",How to Prospect for Gold4," Areas that contain likely deposits of lode gold have been explored thoroughly. The inexperienced prospector with minimal capital has little chance of discovering a lode worth developing.

,


Water enters the ground through cracks and is drawn into hotter regions that are heated by magma or molten rock.
The heated water dissolves many of the rocks around it.
When the magma reaches cooler and shallower rocks, the metals in the hot water show up as veins or as larger and flatter ore bodies.

, As magma moves up through the Earth’s crust, cooling and solidifying, the gold-bearing solutions from the magma are immediately precipitated in granitic rock.

,


Rocks are forced under continents in mountain building and experience high pressures and temperatures.
Chemical reactions rearrange the rock’s mineral constituents.
Metamorphism causes precious metals to be expelled from the rocks and to move to the surface.

Position the grizzly over your gold pan.,
Prepare for the gold panning process.,
Begin panning for gold.,
Tilt the pan sideways occasionally to let sand and other small materials wash away.,
Do your final panning over a container so you don't lose any small gold pieces that could possibly be in your pan.",How to Pan for Gold in Alaska," Use the shovel to put gravel into the grizzly, and shake it through the holes in the grizzly. Inspect all oversized rocks and other materials for possible gold nuggets, and toss anything that is not gold back into the stream.;
, Squat down by the edge of the stream, and submerge a half-full gold pan in gently moving stream water between your knees. Point the pan riffles away from your body so that you can catch any gold that emerges over the pan's lip. Throw back any pebbles into the stream. Break up clay balls in case any placer gold is trapped inside them. When the water inside the pan clears up, the clay is gone and you can start panning.

, Shake the pan sideways or in a circular motion while keeping it completely submerged underwater. Be on the lookout for heavy, unusually shaped or colored pieces that sink to the bottom of the pan. If you have gold, it will settle to the bottom of the pan.

, If you see dark, heavy mineral grains, you are panning correctly. These minerals could contain precious and semiprecious stones such as magnetite, garnet, scheelite, zircon, cassiterite, and platinum, so look out for them as well as for gold.


As a general rule, if you find something heavy, keep it for later analysis. A geologist or miner will be able to identify the items you find.

, Use a magnet to separate magnetic grains from everything else. Use tweezers to pick up possible small gold pieces. If you find any possible small pieces of gold, save them in a water-filled vial.

;
, Shake it back and forth and side to side. Make sure you do not shake so intensely that materials get washed out of the pan.








, The gravel should begin spinning in a circle inside the pan. Doing this will make most of the dirt and clay wash out of the pan or dissolve. Roll any roots or moss over the pan with your fingers--doing this will make certain that any potential gold-containing dirt gets caught by the pan.








, Make sure they are washed clean (they should be after following these steps. Repeat these steps until all the large-ish rocks have been removed and the heavier concentrates (such as gold and sand) have settled at the bottom of the pan.








, Tilt the pan slightly away from you so that it looks like you are trying to catch the current of the water.








, Use a slight forward tossing motion as if you were on the verge of flipping a hotcake (but don’t actually flip the contents of the pan). Be cautious but use enough force to move the surface of the pan and the lighter gravel out over the edge of the pan.







, Shake it back and forth while it is still in the water. Leveling and shaking the pan will cause the gold to settle to the bottom of the pan and the lighter material to come to the top.








, When you finish this part of the panning process, there should only be about two cups of heavier material left in your pan. There should not be anymore rocks or pebbles. The materials remaining in the pan are the heaviest. They consist of black sand, or ‘concentrates’, and, if you’re lucky, gold.








, Make sure there is about an inch of water left in the pan. The water is necessary because you will continue to sift the sand from the gold when the pan is taken out of the stream.








, Swirl the water and materials slowly in a circle. Doing this allows you to check and see if there are any larger nuggets or pieces of gold that can be picked out by hand.








If you do find nuggets, place them in the container that you will store your gold in. This could be a legitimate gold sample bottle purchased at a store, or a jar or pill bottle found at home., Repeat the steps of part three (alternating back and forth between swirling the pan and leveling and shaking it.) Make sure to be extremely careful when using this step--if you shake your pan too vigorously, you may lose some of your gold.








, Remove the pan from the stream, keeping as little water as possible in the pan. Place a magnet on the bottom side of the pan and slowly move it around the pan. Black sand is magnetic and will be attracted to the magnet. This process will quickly separate the black sand from the gold.









If you choose to use the magnet, you can either scoop the trapped black sand out, or use a gold snifter bottle. Snifter bottles have a sucking tube attached to the top (just like eye drop bottles, which you can use for a store bought snifter.) When you squeeze the bottle, a vacuum is created. When you release the bottle, it will suck up whatever its pointing at (in this case, gold and water.) Your gold will then safely be in the bottle., Once you have sifted as much black sand as possible from the gold, it is best to pour the combination into a bottle. The safest way to pour the pan’s contents into a bottle is to place a funnel on the mouth of the bottle. Pour the pan’s contents into the bottle.

, You are now a genuine prospector.

, Whether there is a family spot, you’ve heard legends about a certain stream, or you just have a hunch, there is generally some truth behind the wives tales and family stories. While you may think that because a spot has already been panned there won’t be any gold left, this isn’t the case. Streams and rivers carry small flakes and nuggets from upstream deposits. Every winter, storms unearth more gold, and that gold could be yours.

, The spot you pick should have water that is a minimum of six inches deep. If it is any shallower than that, the water might be too muddy or filled with leaves and other debris to get a good look at your pan when it is under the water.

, The water should be moving fast enough to carry away the silt and debris you sift out of your pan, but slow enough the water will not upset your panning motions when your pan is submerged.

, This is optional but a large rock that you can sit on while prospecting will make your day much easier (and your legs and back will thank you).

, Standard pans are either metal or plastic. Plastic pans are better for beginners because they are rust-proof, lighter in weight than metal pans, black (which allows the gold to be seen better) and they can be textured with ribs to catch gold.


If you do use a steel pan like the 49ers of yore, make sure to remove any oil from its surface. (If you are using a newly bought pan, you shouldn’t have to worry about oil.) Remove oil by holding the pan over a campfire with a pair of tongs or fireproof gloves. Heat the pan to a dull red glow and then dunk it in water. This process removes the oil and leaves the pan with a dark blue color that makes seeing the gold easier.

, Sieves can be set over a pan and will separate the large items from smaller ones. It is not necessary to use a sieve but they can be helpful, when sifting the gold from black sand and concentrates.

Press the object into the plaster of Paris.,
Remove the object.",How to Make Fossils Using Plaster of Paris1," This can get a little messy (especially if there are children around), so lay down some newspapers, put away any objects you don't want to get gooey, and grab your essentials. You'll need:


A small natural object (shell, leaf, bone, etc.)
Petroleum jelly
Plaster of Paris
Water
Small disposable dish or Tupperware container (such as a margarine tub);
, Any object from nature works -- shells, leafs, and animal bones are all good choices. If you do choose a leaf, make sure it's not dry and crackly. It must also fit in your container!

, This will keep the object from sticking to the plaster when you try to remove it. Coat it thoroughly!

, Follow the directions on the plaster of Paris packaging. Mix them together thoroughly and let the concoction sit for a few minutes without stirring.


You should need about 2x more water than plaster, but you can adjust the ratio as you see fit.

, Be careful not to push too hard! Now your part is done; all it has to do is dry. Set it aside and revisit it tomorrow; drying will take at least one day.

, After you've waited 24 hours, pop your natural item out of the plaster of Paris and voila! There's your fossil! It's just like a shell was enveloped in soil for thousands of years, disintegrated, and left behind this image.

Clean the area.,
Combine the plaster of Paris with water.,
Choose an object for the template of your fossil.,
Knead the modeling clay until it is soft and pliable.,
Coat the object with petroleum jelly.,
Fill the impression left by your object with plaster of Paris.,
Peel the clay off the hardened plaster to free the fossil.",How to Make Fossils Using Plaster of Paris2," You'll be working with modeling clay and plaster, so, needless to say, this isn't the cleanest of projects. Lay some newspapers down and let's get started. You'll need:


Plaster of Paris
Water
Modeling clay
Petroleum jelly
Small natural objects such as sea shells
Paper cups
Plastic spoons
Newspaper or paper towels

, Use 1 part plaster of Paris to 2 parts water and mix well in a paper cup with a plastic spoon. Let it sit while you work with the clay.

, Generally, leaves, shells, branches, or bones work best. Just make sure you have enough clay and plaster to cover it.

, This will be what your object rests and forms an impression in. It needs to be kneaded until it can cover the area of your object.

, Firmly yet slowly press it into the modeling clay to make an impression. The petroleum jelly prevents it from sticking to the clay, so be generous.


Remove the object carefully to create a mold in the shape of the item you used.

, Smooth the plaster to the level of the clay to form a flat surface.


Place your clay and plaster mold on a newspaper, paper towel, or other disposable surface and allow it to harden. You'll need to wait at least overnight, but 2 or 3 days is preferable and safer.

, The shape of your object should be recreated in the plaster, details intact.

When in doubt, look for a book or chart endorsed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).

, If you only need to identify a gemstone on rare occasions, you might be able to manage the task by looking at individual gemstone identification charts online. These charts are much less detailed and less extensive, but they might work in a pinch.


The Hiddenite Gems' gemstone identification chart can be used when you know color and hardness.
The Gem Select RI chart can be used when you know refractive index and birefringence: http://www.gemselect.com/gem-info/refractive-index.php

The American Federation of Mineralogical Societies (AFMS) offers a free Mohs' Scale chart: http://www.amfed.org/t_mohs.htm


, A stone with a rough or sandy texture should not be identified as a gemstone.;
, A stone that is readily malleable—i.e. easy to shape by hammering, crushing, or bending it—the stone is more likely a metallic ore than an actual gemstone.True gemstones have a crystalline structure. This structure can be shaped through cutting, fracturing, and abrasion, but it has fixed planes that cannot be altered by pressure alone.
Don't hit a stone with a hammer if you don't want to shatter it. Real gemstones don't get bend or reshaped, but they do break.

, In particular, pearls and fossilized wood can be mistakenly classified as gemstones but do not fit the qualifications in the strictest sense of the term.

, Synthetic stones share the same structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of their natural counterparts, but they are created in a lab rather than made naturally. You can usually spot a synthetic by observing several characteristics.


Synthetic stones often have curved growth patterns inside the stone rather than angular growth patterns.
Gas bubbles are that ar round and come in large strings are often an indication, but be careful, since a gas bubble in an inclusion can occur within natural stones.
Platinum or gold platelets can stick to synthetic stones.
Fingerprint-patterned inclusions are common in synthetics, as are nail-shaped inclusions, chevron (v-shaped) growth patterns, wispy veil-like inclusions, and interior columnar structures.

, An imitation stone is a material that looks like a real gemstone upon first glance in spite of the fact that it is made of a completely different material. These stones can be natural or artificial, but there are a few good techniques used to spot them either way. Pay a special attention while checking Turquoise, Lapis, Sapphire, Ruby and Emerald because there are many treatments available in market which make the stones same like natural


The surface of an imitation may look pitted and uneven, like an orange peel.
Some imitations have swirl marks known as ""flow lines.""
Large, round gas bubbles are common within imitations.
Imitations tend to feel lighter than their natural counterparts.

, Assembled stones are made of two or more materials. These stones may consist entirely of natural gems, but oftentimes, synthetic materials are mixed in.


Use a penlight to illuminate the stone when checking for signs of assembly.
Look for differences in luster or for colored and colorless cement.
Also look for the ""red ring effect."" Turn the stone face down and look for a red ring along the outer part of the stone. If you spot the red ring, you probably have an assembled stone.

, The color of the gemstone is often your first clue. This component can be further divided into three parts: hue, tone, and saturation.Do not shine a light into the stone to examine its color unless you have a dark stone and need to determine whether it is black, dark blue, or another deep color.
""Hue"" refers to the stone's overall body color. Be as specific as possible. For instance, if a stone is a yellowish green, identify it as such instead of merely saying ""red."" The GIA separates stone hue into 31 different colors.
""Tone"" refers to whether a color is dark, medium, light, or somewhere in between.
""Saturation"" refers to the intensity of color. Determine whether the hue is warm (yellow, orange, red) or cool (purple, blue, green). With warm colors, check the stone for brown tints. For cool colors, check the stone for gray tints. The more brown or gray you see, the less saturated the stone color is.

, Transparency describes how light filters through the gemstone. A stone can be transparent, translucent, or opaque.


Transparent stones are completely see-through (example: diamonds).
Translucent stones can be seen through, but some color or haze alters the image (example: amethyst or aquamarine).
Opaque stones cannot be seen through (example: opal).

, You can determine heft—how heavy the gemstone is—by simply bouncing it in your hand. This is a quick and easy way to estimate a stone's weight without performing complex specific gravity tests and equations.


To judge heft, bounce the stone in the palm of your hand and ask yourself if it feels as heavy as you would expect for its size or if it feels heavier or unusually light.
Specific gravity readings are fairly outdated as a practice among gemologists, and heft measurements are used as a relatively accurate estimation.
For example, aquamarine has low heft while blue topaz, which is similar in appearance, has a high or heavy heft. Similarly, diamond has a lower heft than synthetic cubic zirconia., While not a foolproof method of identification, some gemstones are more likely to be cut in certain ways. Oftentimes, ideal cuts are determined by the way light bounces off the crystalline structure of the stone.


The most common cut styles you will run across include faceted, cabochon, cameo, bead, and tumbled. Within each of these basic cut styles, you will usually see sub-styles, as well.

, There are a few identification tests that you may wish to avoid if you need to preserve the gemstone in its current state. This includes hardness, streak, and cleavage tests.


Some stones are physically harder than others, and hardness is usually measured by the Mohs' Scale. Use the various substances provided in a hardness kit to scratch the surface of the gemstone. If the stone can be scratched, it is softer than the substance you scratched it with. If the stone cannot be scratched, it is harder than the substance.
To test streak, drag the stone across a ceramic plate. Compare the streak left behind to the streaks illustrated on a streak chart.
""Cleavage"" refers to the way a crystal breaks. If there are chips along to surface, examine the area inside the chips. If not, you will need to strike the gemstone hard enough to break it. Ask yourself if the area is rounded like rings on a seashell (conchoidal), straight like steps, granular, splintery, or uneven.

, Optical phenomenon only occurs inside certain stones. Depending on the stone, you might observe color change, asterism, bands of moving light, or more.


Check for optical phenomena by passing a pen light across the stone's surface.
Color change is one of the most important optical phenomena to look for, and every stone should be checked for color change. Look for changes in color between natural light, incandescent light, and fluorescent light., Luster refers to the quality and intensity with which a surface reflects light. When testing for luster, reflect light off the portion of the gemstone with the best polish.


To check for luster, turn the stone, allowing light to reflect off its surface. View the stone with the naked eye and with a 10x loupe.
Determine if the stone looks dull, waxy, metallic, shiny (adamantine), glass-like (vitreous), greasy, or silky.

, The manner in which a stone separates white light into its spectral colors is called dispersion, and the visible display of dispersion is called fire. Examine the amount and strength of this ""fire"" to help identify the stone.


Shine a penlight through the stone and examine the fire inside the stone. Ask yourself if the fire is weak, moderate, strong, or extreme., You can test refractive index (RI) using a refractometer. Using this device, you'll be able to measure the degree at which the course of light is altered within the stone. Each gemstone has its own RI, so discovering a sample's RI can help you figure out what sort of stone it actually is.


Place a small bead of RI fluid on the metal surface of the refractometer near the back of the crystal hemicylinder (the window on which the stone will sit).
Place the stone facet face down on the fluid dot and slide it toward the middle of the hemicylinder crystal using your fingers.
Look through the viewer lens without magnification. Continue looking until you see the outline of a bubble, then look at the bottom of this bubble. Take the reading from there, rounding the decimal to the nearest hundredth.
Use the magnifying lens to take a more specific reading and round it to the nearest thousandth.

, Birefringence is related to RI. While doing birefringence test, you will turn the gemstone on the refractometer six times throughout the observation period and note the changes.


Perform a standard RI test. Instead of keeping the stone still, gradually turn it 180 degrees, making each separate turn about 30 degrees. At each 30 degree mark, take a new RI reading.
Subtract the lowest reading from the highest to find the stone's birefringence. Round it to the nearest thousandth.

, Use this test on translucent and transparent stones. You can determine whether the stone is only singly refractive (SR) or doubly refractive (DR) to help identify it. Some stones can also be classified as aggregate (AGG).


Turn on the light of a polariscope and place the stone face down on the lower glass lens (polarizer). Look through the top lens (analyzer), turning the top lens until the area around the stone looks darkest. This is your starting point.
Turn the analyzer 360 degrees and watch how the light around the stone changes.
If the stone appeared dark and stays dark, it is likely an SR. If the stone starts light and stays light, it is likely AGG. If the lightness or darkness of the stone changes, it is likely DR.

Research the Waterford marks.,
Clean the crystal.,
Hold the crystal up to the light.",How to Identify Waterford Crystal1," Search online for images of authentic Waterford acid stamps. Older stamps feature the name “Waterford” in Gothic-script in either one of two designs.Pieces made since the year 2000 include the seahorse trademark., Wash by hand in warm-to-hot water with mild dish soap. Prevent spotting by also washing with a 1/4 cup of ammonia. Use a soft cloth or sponge to avoid scratching, which may occur with scouring pads. Rinse the crystal and allow it to air-dry.If you dry it with a cloth, be sure the cloth is lint-free.


To clean vases or decanters or any other piece that you can’t reach inside of, fill them halfway with warm-to-hot water and a few drops of dish soap. Add 2 tablespoons of white vinegar or ammonia. Then add 1 cup of uncooked rice. Swirl the mixture around to clean the inside of the piece. Rinse it out with warm-to-hot water and then set it upside-down to air-dry.For tougher stains, fill the piece all the way with warm water. Add a denture-cleaning tablet. Wait for the mixture to remove the residue. Rinse the crystal thoroughly and set it upside-down to air-dry., Use a magnifying glass to search for the acid stamp.Start at the base, where it is most often located.Search the grooves next if you don’t find it on the base.


Be aware that excessive washing, usage, and age may effect the acid stamp’s visibility.If you find none, have the crystal examined by an expert to authenticate it.

Classify igneous rocks into two main types: intrusive or extrusive.,
Identify the texture type of your rock.,
Look at the composition of your rock.",How to Identify Igneous Rocks1," Each of these types of rocks will have specific properties that will help you distinguish which type your igneous rock is.Magma is molten rock that flows beneath the earth's surface. Igneous rocks are formed by cooling magma.
The location of the formation of the rock, as well as how fast the magma cools will determine the type of igneous rock.
Intrusive rocks form from the cooling of magma deep beneath the earths surface. Since this occurs below the earth's surface, the magma will cool very slowly.
As magma cools, it will form crystals.
Intrusive rocks have larger crystals typically formed together to form the rock mass.
An example of an intrusive rock is granite.
When magma is above the earth's crust, it is known as lava.
Extrusive rocks form through very fast cooling of lava above the Earth's surface.
Extrusive rocks have very small, almost microscopic crystals. These are often described as fine-grained rocks. You usually can't see these with the naked eye.
The most common type of extrusive rock is basalt.;
, There are 7 different texture classes for igneous rocks, each with their own unique features. Pegmatitic igneous rocks have very large crystals, more than 1 cm in size. These are the slowest cooling type of igneous rocks.
Remember, the slower a rock cools, the larger the crystals will be.
Phaneritic igneous rocks are composed of interlocking crystals that are smaller than crystals in pegmatitic but still visible with the naked eye.
Porphyritic igneous rocks have crystals of two different sizes, often with large crystals set in areas of smaller crystals.
Aphanitic igneous rocks have a fine-grained texture and most of their crystals are too small to see with the naked eye. You will need to use a magnifying glass to observe the crystals in aphanitic rocks.
Igneous rocks that form too quickly for crystals to form have what is called a glassy texture. Obsidian is the only glassy igneous rock, and can be identified by its dark color. This looks like dark black glass.
Vesicular igneous rocks, such as pumice, look bubbly and form before gases are able to escape as lava forms the rock. This also formed with very rapid cooling.
Pyroclastic igneous rock is a texture composed of volcanic fragments ranging from very fine (ash) to very coarse (tuffs and breccias). , Composition refers to the percentage of certain minerals in your rock. You will need a rock guide to determine what minerals are present in your rock. There are four main composition types for igneous rocks:Identifying the composition of your rock can be very difficult if you are not an experienced rock collector or geologist.
If you have any questions about how to identify a rock, contact a collector or geologist at a local college or university.
Felsic igneous rocks are light in color. Their mineral composition is primarily feldspars and silicates such as quartz.
Granite is an example of a felsic rock.
Felsic rocks have a low density and contain 0-15% mafic crystals. Mafic minerals are olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite.
Mafic igneous rocks are dark in color and consist mainly of magnesium and iron. They contain 46-85% mafic mineral crystals and are high in density.
Basalt is an example of a mafic rock.
Ultramafic igneous rocks are also dark in color and contain higher amounts of the minerals found in mafic rocks. These rocks have greater than 85% mafic mineral crystals.
Dunite is an example of an ultramafic rock.
Intermediate igneous rocks contain 15-45% mafic mineral crystals. They share minerals with both felsic and mafic rocks and are intermediate in color.
Diorite is an example of an intermediate rock.

Choose a mixture.,
Pour plaster and water together.Regardless of the particular material you use, use two parts mixture to one part plaster.,
Stir your mixture until it becomes consistent.Using a mixing spoon or a popsicle stick, stir in the mixing bowl until the water and plaster have become consistent throughout.,
Collect objects to fossilize.There are countless different objects you can choose to fossilize.,
Apply petroleum jelly to your object.Petroleum jelly (or Vaseline) should be applied as a thin covering over the object you're going to fossilize.,
Pour your mould mixture into a foam cup.,
Cast the fossil.Once you have covered your object in petroleum jelly, push the object into the plaster mould.,
Allow time for the mould fossil to harden.,
Tear open the cup.The up is used to give the mould its shape.,
Remove the mould for an imprint.If you've pushed your object only partway into the mould, the petroleum jelly should allow you to pull it up without damaging the object.,
Weather the mould for authenticity.,
Chisel out a buried fossil with a precision hammer.",How to Make Fossils," Although rubber cement, cement and even flour can be used to make a fossil mould, plaster of Paris is the recommended choice of material, as it's cheap and designed to be easy to use. If you're planning on presenting your fossil outdoors however, cement will increase the durability.


A 4.5lb box is approximately $5, and will offer you more plaster than you'll ever need for your fossilizing needs.Harder materials like cement aren't recommended for proper mixing bowls. Use a bowl you think is completely expendable.
A combination of flour with other materials like salt and coffee grounds can be used as well to a similar effect.;
, Get a mixing bowl and pour them in together. Although exact measurements are not necessary, you can use measuring cups from your kitchen for this step.









For most fossils, two cups of plaster and one cup water should give you all the mould you need. Double this recipe if your fossil objects are bigger and need more space.
If the plaster you purchased indicates it needs a different proportion of water, you should go with its recommendation. Certain brands and types of plaster may have individual preferences.

, By the end, the mixture should be thick and goopy without having excess plaster powder visible in the mix.









This is your chance to troubleshoot your mixture if there are any problems. If the mixture doesn't seem semi-solid and thick, add more plaster. If some of the plaster isn't joining the mixture, add water.

, Shells and animal bones are best for their distinctive shapes. Plants and leaves can be scooped up from the backyard or nearby park and fossilized as well. For the sake of demonstrating the fossilization process, you should choose something organic.


Plastic toys of bugs and animals should be used in lieu of the real thing.

, This will make it easier to dig out once you've let the mould settle. Wipe away any excess jelly. Having too much on the object will negatively affect the mixture's hardening process and muddle the imprint.








, Take a paper cup and pour in your mixture until it's 3/4 full. Don't fill it up all the way, as you'll soon be placing the object in and shouldn't risk the cup overflowing.









If your fossil is bigger, a foam bowl or paper bag may be used as well.

, At this point, you have the option whether to imprint your specimen part way, or bury it completely. Imprinting it will create a mould to put on display, while a full bury will offer a chance to play archaeologist and dig it out.









If you're making fossils in a group, you should start with imprinting. Imprint fossils are more cost-effective and can be enjoyed as a group., Wait until the mould has solidified before you go any further. Using plaster of Paris, the mixture should dry completely within a couple of hours.









Heating the mould at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour will speed up the process of solidification.

, once it's hardened, you'll want to dispose of the cup entirely. Using scissors or a knife, cut the cup from top to bottom and tear it away from your mould. This should leave you with a plaster block.









It is recommended you tear open the cup over a trash bin in order to trap excess sediment and limit the mess.Don't forget to put the paper cups in the compost when you're done using them.

, Be gentle and slowly pull it out with your fingers. If you're rough and fast with it, you may risk hurting the imprint or the object itself.








, If you've left an imprint for decoration's sake, chiselling at the mould itself will make it look like you recently dug it up. Take a hammer and chip away at the sides and corners of your block. Add small dents and imperfections. Although you shouldn't go overboard with your chiselling, the weather-worn look will add to the effect of your fossil display.

, If you decided to bury the object completely in the mixture, you'll be able to play archaeologist. Take a chiselling hammer and tap away at the mould. Work your way around it and try to chisel out your fossil. Be careful not to accidentally chisel at the object itself. This experience reflects what it's like to dig up a real fossil.

If possible, visit a retailer or collector in possession of Waterford pieces featuring stickers to compare them in person. If you’re in doubt, seek an appraiser to judge your piece’s authenticity.

, Remember that a sticker may be transferred from a genuine Waterford to another piece.Although older pieces may not have had one to begin with, check the crystal anyway for an acid stamp for further verification. If there isn’t one, have the crystal examined by an expert to confirm that it’s a true Waterford."

, Make sure the piece acts as a prism. Twist it slowly in front of the light source. Look for a rainbow to appear when the light disperses.Do the same with the glassware and note that it does not produce a rainbow.

, Tap the rim. Listen for a musical chime that’s high in pitch. To contrast, do the same with a piece of regular glassware and listen for the dull thud that comes when you tap it., Hold the glassware in one hand and your crystal in the other. If your piece is truly crystal, it should feel significantly heavier due to its higher lead content., If you’re satisfied that your piece is truly crystal, have it examined by an expert to confirm whether its design matches one of Waterford’s, or research it on your own with a book identifying Waterford’s various designs. However, due to the high value of Waterford crystals and the high number of counterfeits out there,seek out a professional opinion for better peace of mind.

Know the difference between the three major rock types.,
Look at your rock for signs of layering.,
Examine your rock for signs of visible grains.,
Classify the grain type in your rock.,
Look at your rock for additional features.",How to Identify Igneous Rocks2," The three major rock types are igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. Igneous rocks are made from the rapid or slow cooling of magma/lava.
Metamorphic rocks change form based on the influence of heat, pressure, or chemical activity.
Sedimentary rocks are essentially formed by pieces of smaller rocks, fossils, and sediments.

, The presence and distribution of layering can help you identify the main type of rock you have. If a rock is layered, it will have different sections that are different colors and may or may not contain small crystals or fossils. You will need to look for these under a magnifying glass.
In cross section, layers in a rock will look like different colors stripes on top of one another.
The presence and distribution of layering can help you identify the main type of rock you have.
Igneous rocks are not layered. If your rock has layers it will be either a metamorphic or sedimentary rock.
Sedimentary rocks will have layers that are softy and crumbly, and are comprised of mud, sand or gravel.
Sedimentary rocks can also have crystals. If the layers in your rock are made up of crystals of varying sizes, then your rock is sedimentary.
Metamorphic rocks have layers made up crystals that are the same size.
The layers of metamorphic rocks are also folded and deformed.

, You should use a magnifying glass to do this, as some grains and crystals can be very tiny and you won't be able to see them with the naked eye. If your rock has visible grains, proceed to the next step to classify your rock based on grain type. If there are no visible grains, use the following criteria to classify your rock:Igneous rocks are very dense and hard. They may have a glassy appearance.
Metamorphic rocks may also have a glassy appearance. You can distinguish these from igneous rocks based on the fact that metamorphic rocks tend to be brittle, lightweight, and an opaque black color.
Sedimentary rocks with no grains will resemble dry clay or mud.
Sedimentary rocks with no grains also tend to be soft, as they can usually be scratched easily with a fingernail. These rocks will also react to hydrochloric acid.

, Remember, not all rocks will have visible grains. Grains will appear as small pieces of sand, fossils, or crystals.Only metamorphic and sedimentary rocks will contain fossils. Sedimentary rocks may have visible fossils such as whole or partial leaves, shells, footprints etc. Metamorphic rocks will contain only highly fragmented fossils.
Sedimentary rocks will have grains made up of sand, silt or gravel. These grains may be rounded in shape (clastic), or be made up of other rocks.
If your grains contain crystals, you can use the orientation and size of the crystals to identify the rock.
Igneous rocks have crystals that are randomly oriented. They may have large crystals in ground mass with smaller crystals.
Sedimentary rocks have crystals that are easily broken or scratched.
Metamorphic rocks contain crystals that have a foliated or scaly appearance. These are often long and arranged in a parallel pattern.

, You want to look for any type of metallic appearance or streamlined flow structures.Rocks that have a metallic appearance with a scaly or smooth texture are metamorphic.
Igneous rocks may have a vesicular texture. This is when the rock appears to be very porous with many holes.
Pumice is an example of a rock that has a very porous texture.
Igneous rocks will be very hard. Many types of igneous rocks have rocky streamlined flow structures in them.

There may not be a large degree of variation between the buyers because of the spot gold price, but give each a call and find out what they are currently offering.


The US Mint does not necessarily get involved in the pricing, but they do provide a handy tool that allows you to find local buyers/sellers.There are many other exchange sites that keep track of precious metal (i.e. gold, silver, platinum). Just search online and there is a wealth of resources.
Be aware the spot gold price may be the current price, but many dealers charge a premium to buy the gold.;
, Because the price of gold fluctuates so rapidly, once you find the right location to sell your gold, you'll need to move quickly to lock in the price. Waiting too long could cause your gold coins to lose significant value. Some require a simple online form to be filled out with the various details.

, Once you establish a plan to do business with a local dealer, they may require nothing more than a phone call to lock in a sell price. They'll likely want to weigh your gold in person and verify the clarity of the coins. However, selling gold in person has a few disadvantages.There is no guaranteed assurance your gold will not be substituted with something less valuable, but similar looking.
Selling gold by hand will likely incur a higher premium. Gold insurance scams are common, and premiums are developed to overcome the scams.

, Online dealers provide a fairly straight-forward method of selling gold coins. Most have nothing more than a few steps to complete before shipping the gold. Check the following steps and you'll likely be well-prepared:


Register for an account on the respective website.
Call their trading department for a current price.
Talk with their specialist regarding your gold coins' value
Determine if there is a minimum amount to sell in order to do business with them., You can put your gold coins on auction sites like eBay if you'd like to see if someone is willing speculate and pay a little more. Depending on the auction site, there may be a registration process, but some simply require the completion of an online form and submission of a photo of your gold., Once you've figured out all the details on your coin, the method of selling, and negotiated the price, it's time to get paid. Some gold exchanges will allow you to fill out a form with routing number and checking account number for an ACH transfer.


You may even be asked to provide a voided check for ACH transfers.
Buying and selling gold is often done with cash, however, so be prepared to work without credit.

Plastics can be a great storage medium for silver, but you should verify that they aren’t PVC plastics, which are generally softer plastics., There are many products marketed for coin storage, but some like coin folders, are designed more to make coins easy to view than for storing extremely valuable mints. Good storage devices include hard plastic storage cases and glass or plastic coin tubes.Coin folders can be problematic because they expose your coins to air. However, if you have the original, airtight packaging, you can keep the coin in the packaging and place it in the folder. Make sure that the flaps are made of mylar, rather than soft plastic with PVC.
Many varieties of coin containers may be purchased online.
Silver is susceptible to tarnish from sulfur compounds and nitrates. These are chemical compounds that exist in the air as a result of pollution."

Purchase a metal detector.,
Round up some basic scavenging supplies.,
Find a good location to metal detect in.,
Get to know your metal detector's settings.",How to Metal Detect1," There are hundreds of models out there, but you don't need to most expensive one to begin with. While shopping, there are only a few features to consider, depending on your needs and engagement with the hobby. Some things to think about include:


Your level of interest. There are many great, all-purpose finders good for most explorers. There are also deep-seeking detectors that allow the intrepid explorer to dig for serious treasures.


All-purpose: Bounty Hunter Pioneer 505, Garrett Ace 250, White's Coinmasters, Minelab’s X-Terra Series

Deep-seeking: Nokta FORS CoRe Pro, Minelab’s GPX 5000, OKM Black Hawk, Nokta Golden King


Do you plan on beach-combing? Make sure that your metal detector is waterproof.
Do you plan on looking up gold flakes and bits? You'll need a high-frequency, extra-sensitive detector like the Nokta FORS GOLD, Garrett's AT Gold or Fisher's Gold,Bugs.;
, Your metal detector is only part of the equation. You'll need a bit more gear, including:










Headphones: A big set of over-ear headphones are best, but anything will do. The metal-detector will beep when it comes across metal, sending sound through the headphones.

Gloves: You'll be digging into the ground, sorting through dirt and metal, and be down on the ground a lot. Gloves will keep your hands safe and comfortable.

Trowel: You'll need something to dig with, so get a nice trowel, at least 8-10"" or longer.

Pinpointer (Optional): This is a small, more precise metal detector, usually sold for $20-30. It can help find the object after the metal detector has found a patch of dirt with something in it., Places with high foot-traffic (beaches, parks, playgrounds), fields, and backyards are all great places to start looking. Once you're used to wielding your detector old ruins, houses, and abandoned areas will turn into treasure troves. Some other great spots include:


Under ski lifts
Churchyards
Sand, dirt or grassy parking areas
Recreational vehicle parks and campsites.
Around resort areas., All detectors are different, and reading the manual is key to getting the most out of yours. That said, there are some basic features you should know whether you read the manual or not:










Discrimination: Allows you to choose what kind of targets you want. For example, if you only want coins, you can set it to ignore iron objects. Useful in heavy trash areas or if you're searching for specific things.

Sensitivity: Allows you to choose how precise the detector will be. This, again, helps you hone in: if there are pipes nearby and the detector won't stop beeping, lowering the sensitivity will help you find the good stuff.

Detection Mode: This allows you to filter out certain objects, like coins, to make detection more precise.

Ground Balance: Allows you to account for common minerals. If, for example, you keep getting pings on ""iron"" but find nothing, you can ""balance out"" the iron in the ground so that the machine doesn't beep for low levels of iron."

Package your shipment.,
Choose your method of shipment.,
Include any shipping extras.",How to Sell Gold Coins2," Remove everything on the box that may indicate anything related to gold coins inside the box. A business name indicating gold, or anything related to bullion, is a clear indicator of the contents. Follow the steps below to ensure your package doesn't encounter any issues when sending out your gold coins:


Double box - one inside another - in case the outer box rips/breaks.
Use heavy-duty tape with nylon to cover every single edge and corner. Ensure the package is as secure as possible.
Reinforce heavier packages with strapping tape.
If the business with which you are dealing requires something extra, like a filled out form or a voided check, include it in the box where applicable., There are several options when choosing how to send your coins. In general, the most secure method, discrete method possible is preferred. You may even be able to deliver it by hand.


USPS doesn't have fuel or residential charges like UPS and FedEx, but that doesn't mean the price will be cheaper.Some sellers offer door-to-door services. An overnight shipping label will be sent to you, and pickup will be scheduled according to their schedule., Because gold is more valuable than the average shipment, and likely more prone to theft, you'll probably want to take some extra precaution when shipping your coins to ensure everything arrives to the buyer safely.


Ensure you get a confirmation number. You will want to track the package, something also called delivery confirmation.
Get insurance. Larger carriers offer loss or damage protection. Some, like UPS, offer up to $100 USD coverage for free. Based upon the declared value, you will have to make additional payment."
"
Research the spot gold price.,
Choose the gold coin to sell.,
Determine the weight and value of your gold.",How to Sell Gold Coins3," The spot gold price is basically the current going price for gold if you were to try and sell your gold coins over the counter to someone.Typically, the gold is sold by ounce, gram, or kilogram.Check the price on a larger finance website. The basic gold ticker is GCM16.CMX, and everything about the current price, historical price, and various financial indicators like Simple Moving Average (SMA) is listed on most financial websites.Monex.com has current prices and charts, and has been operating for more than 40 years.
Kitco.com is a more news-oriented site. You can get the latest prices as well as lots of recent news regarding the current price of gold.

, Some gold coins are easier to sell than others, particularly depending on your location. Some have purity guarantees, and can even be added to retirement accounts. The rarer coins are more difficult to sell, because grading can be both difficult and debatable.


Within the U.S., the Canadian Maple Leaf (24-karat) and American Eagle (22-karat) coins are the most frequently used. The American Eagle coin is guaranteed pure by the U.S. Mint.
Outside the U.S., the Canadian Maple Leaf dominates. It's also easier to sell the South African Krugerrand and Austrian Vienna Philharmonic.
The U.S. made a pure gold coin called the American Buffalo in 2006. It was intended to compete with the Maple Leaf, but it's not used as frequently., Actual gold weight (AGW) of your coins is typically displayed in Troy ounces (i.e price per troy ounce). If the ounces aren't displayed, weigh the coin first. After it's weighed, you'll need to know the amount of non-gold metals inside the alloy. Once you know the AGW, multiply it by the gold price per Troy ounce to know the value of your coin.For impure coins, you'll have to break down the fraction included in AGW. For instance, if the coin were to weigh two ounces, and it was 50% pure, you'd have 1 Troy ounce AGW.
Keep in mind a Troy ounce (31.1 grams) is not the same as a normal ounce (28.35 grams).If not specifically listed, you'll need to confer with a professional to determine the non-gold metals in your coin.
Convert grams to AGW by dividing the grams by 31.1035.
Some coins are standardized, and have the weight in Troy ounces displayed prominently.

Protect your silver at home.,
Take it to the bank.,
Call a precious metal depository.,
Keep count of your coins.",How to Store Silver Coins2," The key to keeping your silver safe is to keep it hidden and locked away. Silence is the most important part of any safety plan; the fewer people who know about your coins, the safer they are. After that, a hiding place and/or safe are important safety measures.


Many obvious hiding places are problematic because they are just as obvious to robbers as they are to you. The best hiding places include unlikely locations like the bottom the of a clothes’ basket.For any substantial silver collection you should purchase a safe. The safe should be too large too carry away and rated UL-15 or higher. An added advantage to owning a safe is that if you notify your insurance company, they will reduce your premium.For added safety, consider an alarm system as well.
For extra protection, search online for “storage compartments” or “secret bookcases.” Build a hidden compartment in the floor or the wall, hide it behind a decoration, and then store the silver in a safe., For $200-$500 a year, you can have your silver stored at the bank in a safety deposit box. This is an extremely secure option, though some people find working around bank hours inconvenient. Furthermore, safety deposit boxes are not insured. You will need to seek an outside third party insurance, in case something unfortunate does happen at the bank., There are some third party companies that specialize in protecting precious metals. Their facilities ought to be highly secure and they should do a regular accounting of your stock to ensure that nothing has disappeared. If anything does go missing, most of these depositories have insurance programs that will cover your loss.Don’t be too trusting. Interrogate the depository’s insurance program carefully to establish that it will protect you adequately in case of theft.

, Regardless of what method you choose to secure your coins, you need to make sure that you know what you have. Keep a list of each of your coins individually that includes the date that it was minted, the type of coin, and any distinguishing features. Review your stash to make sure that nothing has gone missing."
"
Clean your hands before touching the silver.,
Keep your hands off the face of the coin.,
Handle over a soft surface.,
Keep your bodily fluids to yourself.,
Don't try to clean your coins.",How to Store Silver Coins3," Your hands naturally accumulate dirt and oils that can damage coins over time. Before touching your coins, wash and dry your hands. Alternatively, you can use sanitizer. Ideally, you will do all three.How cautious you are with your coins should vary depending upon what type of coin it is. Most coins are only as valuable as the silver they are made of. These you do not need to be careful with. However, if your coin has any special collector’s value, you should do everything you can to make sure that it experiences no decay.

, The face is the most important part of the coin. You do not want to damage the engraving. So, when picking up your coins, always grab them by the edges, touching the surface as little as possible., If you do drop your coin, ensure that it doesn’t fall on a hard wood or stone surface. If you working over such a surface, just place a towel or cloth underneath you to protect your investment., Your coins do not appreciate moisture. Refrain from using saliva to try to clean them; it will only make matters worse. Similarly, don’t breathe hard on it to try to blow off dust. Keep all biological elements as far from your coins as possible., There are some products that are marketed commercially to clean coins. Most are abrasive and will remove silver, significantly decreasing the value of the coin. Even tap water can cause damage to your coin. Do not attempt to clean any coins on your own."
"
Cover the ground effectively by sweeping the detector in an arc in front of you.,
Move the detector in small circles to determine the precise location of an object after a beep.,
Cut out any objects in a ""plug."",
Use a pin-pointer to determine if the metal is in the plug or the ground.,
Gently sift through the plug, starting from the bottom, to find the metal.,
Rescan the hole after finding the first object.,
Replace the plug into the earth to leave the site as you found it.,
Overlap your lines by a foot or so as you explore.,
Hunt out heavily trafficked areas in each site.",How to Metal Detect2," As you walk, keep the detector roughly two feet in front of you. As you walk, sweep it back and forth in a half circle in front of you, roughly a foot to each side. Walk in a straight line so you don't re-test ground when you turn around.









You want to go ""low and slow,"" and never touch the ground. Walk about half the speed as usual.
The detector should be roughly 6"" or less above the ground., Stop immediately if you hear a beep. Slowly use the detector to find out exactly the spot it beeped at. If you can, increase the sensitivity on the metal detector as you get closer. Move the detector slowly back and forth, then up and down as you find the exact spot where the metal resides.









Many metal detectors even have breakdowns of metal type or potentially coin worth. Work slowly, reading the face of the metal detector as you learn how to use it.

, Your metal detector should tell you how deep the object is, and many trowels have rulers attached to the blade letting you know how deep you're digging. Cut a circular plug roughly 6"" in diameter around the spot the metal detector picked up, then pull out the whole cylinder of dirt.








, If you don't have a pinpointer, place the plug of earth right under your metal detector. This can help you determine if your object is in the plug or the surrounding dirt.








, You want to preserve the dirt and any roots as much as possible. Use gloved fingers to feel through the plug until your find your object.








, It takes two seconds, but most people leave after digging out the first quarter. Your detector will ping the same amount if there is one piece of metal or five, so always rescan once you've dug a hole. Stuff tends to congregate together, so chances are good there will be something else.







, No one wants to see a pockmarked, dug up park. The reason you dig in a plug is so that you can easily return the earth to the ground, allowing it to quickly recover. Once you replace the plug, push it firmly back into the ground to help set it.

, Walk a long, straight line on your first pass. If you don't find anything, move over 1-2 feet and walk back to the right or left of your first line. Overlapping a bit allows the detector to pick up things it might miss on the fringe of your path. You'll be making a giant zig-zag pattern across your search area.









If you're feeling casual, just walking with the detector will work fine. But for a thorough, systematic search you'll need to stick to straight lines.

, There are some places where you are almost guaranteed to find more metal, because people tend to drop more things of all sorts. After you've done an efficient, full sweep of the open ground, try out:









The edges of pathways and trails
Under bleachers or hedges
Areas in front of food stands, vending machines, etc.
The perimeter of bandstands and gazebos."

, With dimes and pennies being of similar size and metal content, check to see that your dimes only deposit registers as all dimes. With machine errors, less than 1% of dimes register as pennies, so be aware of this.

, Instead, use them for purchases or deposit or cash them at your bank

Be realistic.,
Store it.,
Consider the wealth that might have been generated if, in 1965, you had begun - as did others - to withdraw the 1964 and older 90% silver coins from circulation and merely saved them.",How to Invest in Copper As Bullion," You may not know it, but you've already begun. There's a lot of that bullion - in the form of circulating copper pennies - to be found. In some areas of the country, upon examination, as many as one in three pennies will be worth saving.
, Until 1981, pennies were made of 95% copper and 5% zinc, hereinafter referred to as copper.Beginning in 1982, the alloy used to produce pennies was altered to 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper, hereinafter referred to as zinc, to offset increased fabrication costs to the United States Mint as base metal prices became costlier., Pennies exist in both bimetallic forms for that year and may be distinguished by weight; copper is heavier at 3.11 grams as opposed to zinc at 2.5 grams.As well, you can tell the difference by sound. Drop a 1982 penny on a hard surface and copper will produce a melodic timbre - a distinctive ring - as opposed to a dull thud if it is zinc., Set aside those pennies made of copper. You might also have a piggy bank or a jar you've filled with a pile of loose coins. Save the copper; you can spend the zinc., When you finish your search at home, plan a visit to your local bank or credit union where you may purchase rolls of pennies other customers have brought in, or request to order a $25 box of pennies., At the present price of copper, United States pennies minted before 1982 are worth close to two times face value.A highly informative website, Coinflation.com, updates the value daily of the metal intrinsic to all forms of United States coinage., You'll find that this venture may introduce you to what can become an engrossing and often fascinating new hobby, that of collecting and completing a full set of Lincoln pennies. If so, welcome to the hobby of numismatics., While this means of investing in copper bullion is certainly feasible for everyone to participate in, your potential profit is limited by scale, and can only increase in magnitude if you have the means to accumulate a large stockpile of copper pennies., If you have limited space to store your bullion or security is a problem, check out mint storage options online to learn about insured storage., Those same coins are now worth at least twelve times their face value. One could dream of having access to an invention conjured by H. G. Wells to revisit those days or, upon reflection, reach the conclusion that you already have such a time machine, as virtually the same opportunity afforded by silver in 1965 now exists with copper today."

, Use a hammer to flatten the lid to a thinner texture, similar to the height of a coin. Try to hammer in any edges so that they fold under and into the coin shape. Leave no sharp edges.


Be sure to work on a suitable surface, such as a workbench in the garage. Hammering the bottle tops can easily damage the surface underneath.

, Make as many coins from bottle top lids as you want before spraying, to make the spraying process more economic.

, Spray both sides of the flattened bottle top lids with gold spray paint. It is easiest to spray all on one side first, then leave to dry, then turn over and spray the other side. That way, you won't lose any of the gold paint by turning the fake coins over before they dry.


If you prefer, you can hand paint the gold paint on.

Learn the exchange rates for different currencies around the world, and try to buy foreign coins at significantly below the going rate.,

,, These currencies are more liquid to trade, and may even appreciate in value if you are hoping to buy-and-hold.


The German Mark (banknotes and coins) is indefinitely exchangeable for the Euro at the fixed rate of 1.95 German Mark = 1 Euro, and thus coins of the German Mark are as good an investment as the Euro. Especially look for 5 Mark coins, as these represent 2.55 Euro, currently around $3.80 USD as of 2009.

, You'd be surprised how often they come up by mistake in such bins. Some coins, such as Canadian nickels before 1981, are made of 99% nickel. Depending on the size of these coins and the price of the coins in the bin, these may be a great deal on nickel bullion too.

, However, pre-1982 US Cents are the easiest way to hoard cheap copper bullion. In general, avoid buying copper bullion from these bins unless they have already been pre-sorted, as you can generally get a better deal with similar effort sorting US cents.

, As a first step you can separate magnetic from non-magnetic coins. Among the magnetic coins, you will want to look for pure nickel coins.

Obtain rolls of pennies from your local bank.,
Carefully unroll the coins without ripping the coin wrappers.,
Obtain two containers to separate your copper and zinc pennies.,
Re-roll your zinc pennies.,
Try to directly exchange the rolls of zinc pennies for new rolls of coins at the bank.,
If you travel on the road a lot, try to get rolls of coins in various geographical areas.,
Stock up on wrappers.,
Understand that it is currently illegal to melt the coins for their raw material.",How to Hoard Copper Pennies," Pennies generally come in rolls of 50 cents, and boxes containing 50 rolls or $25. If possible, ask the bank for rolls that customers have brought in, as opposed to ones ordered from the Federal Reserve, as the coins tend to be older on average. However, even FR rolls can turn up substantial amounts of copper coins.


Be aware that customer rolled coins may be short by 1 or 2 pennies occasionally, but this should be negligible considering you are going to obtain copper for well below its spot price.
Go into large banks that service average small businesses, as these are usually better than going to a small ""enterprise"" bank, where they could pass the cost of the coin request on to you. (Yes, banks need to pay a small fee to order the coins.) If you're buying in bulk, it's best to open an account at the bank before you order the circulated rolls.;
, You will need the wrappers later to re-roll your post-1982 zinc pennies.


If the wrappers are folded, simply unfold the ends and dump the coins out. If the wrappers come from the federal reserve and are sealed, you will need to gently peel the end of the wrapper, and use a pencil/pen to push the coins out from the other end.
It is important not to disturb the folding on the wrappers because they will indicate the size of the roll and allow you to avoid manually counting the coins later.

, Put the pennies that were minted 1981 and before in the copper container and any pennies minted in 1982 and after in the zinc container.


Pay close attention to any valuable, rare pennies that you might find in the process. Consider reserving these pennies for another collection:
1943 steel pennies, issued during the war in order to save copper.
""Wheat"" pennies, made between 1909 and 1958, with two stalks of wheat instead of the Lincoln Memorial.
Many others, including the famous double die obverse wheat penny, which bears a 1955 mint.



, If you have handled the coin wrappers properly, it should not be too hard to tell how long the rolls should be by the fold on the wrappers. Alternatively, you can see if some banks will count your coins without a fee and sign up for an account there.


It is generally not a good idea to use CoinStar unless you are planning to buy a gift card, so they waive the fee. Get to know what gift cards are offered so you can skip rolling the coins occasionally when you plan on shopping in these areas.

, Banks may be reluctant to exchange too many rolls for cash if they are running short, so exchanging them this way will offset the issue. Mark the wrappers of the rolls that you bring back, so you avoid getting the same rolls of coins back again.

, Circulated pennies don't necessarily travel long geographical distances.

, Many banks will give you free penny wrappers if you go in and ask for them. Stores try to sell them to you.

, Even though the copper in these pennies is worth more than a their face value, the federal government has disallowed this practice for quite some time. Tampering, defacing, and otherwise destroying currency carries with it a sentence of up to six months in prison."

Look for a denomination.,
Look for a date.,
Note the coin's shape.,
Note the coin's size.,
Look at the coin's color.,
Note the image on the coin.,
Look for an inscription.,
Look for a mint mark.,
Consult a reference catalog.",How to Identify Old Coins," If the ""coin"" displays a face value, it is most likely a coin. If the coin has no face value, it may instead be a medallion.;
, Along with a face value, this is the easiest way to identify an old coin as such. Spanish coins minted since the early 17th century are among the oldest to have dates, but many old coins minted since then have been circulated enough to cause their dates to wear away.

, Most, but not all, coins are circular. Coins minted prior to the late 1700s, before the advent of steam-powered coin presses, tended to be irregular in shape. Other coins may be shaped as polygons that approximate circles, such as the 12-sided British threepence minted from 1937 to 1967.

, Knowing a coin's diameter and its thickness can help to identify it, the diameter being the more reliable indicator.


Measure the diameter with a ruler, preferably using the metric increments.
Measure the thickness with a caliper. Handle it carefully to avoid damaging the coin.

, A coin's color can be an indication of the metal it is made from. A golden color can indicate the coin is made of gold, a silvery color can indicate the coin is made of silver, and a brown color can indicate the coin is made of copper.


Color is not an absolute determiner of the metal a coin is made of. A golden color may mean the coin is made of brass, while a silver color may mean the coin is made of a copper-nickel alloy. In the latter case, turning the coin on its edge can help to determine whether the coin is a clad coin using the copper-nickel alloy to sandwich a copper core layer. A clad coin of this kind will show a stripe on its edge.
If still in doubt, you can also test the coin with a magnet. If it's attracted to the magnet, the coin is made of steel or has a steel core.

, Being able to recognize the person, animal, or other image depicted on a coin can help you identify its country of origin and give you a clue to its age.


Although large cents minted in 1792 depicted George Washington's image, it was with the Lincoln penny in 1909 that American coins began to regularly depict presidents and other statesmen. Prior to that, most American coins depicted Liberty as a female figure, shown standing, sitting, walking, in bust form, or just her head. (The so-called ""Mercury"" dime issued prior to 1946 is properly called the Winged Liberty Head dime.)
Most other coins depict an image of the ruler in power over the country or territory for which the coin was issued, either locally or nationally. Consulting a history book or website can help you identify who the ruler was.
Note the image on the reverse (tails) side of the coin as well as the obverse (heads). This sometimes changes over a period of time separate from the obverse image. For example, the Lincoln penny bore a pair of wheat ears from 1909 to 1958, then an image of the Lincoln Memorial until 2009, when it was replaced with a shield.

, The inscription, or legend, on a coin can help you identify its country of origin and may also help determine its age if the date is missing.


American coins usually state ""United States of America"" somewhere on the coin. They also usually bear the word ""Liberty"" and the mottoes ""E Pluribus Unum"" (""out of many, one"") and ""In God We Trust"" (first used in 1863, on all coins since 1938).
Non-American coins bearing English inscriptions probably were issued by other countries that were formerly British colonies and may be part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, such as Canada or Australia.
Older British coins in contrast, generally display the Latin ""Britannia"" or some variation of it such as ""Britanniar"" or ""Britanniarum."" Coins issued prior to 1953 commemorating the rule of a particular monarch may include ""BRITT:OMN:REX,"" short for the Latin phrase meaning ""King (or Queen) of all Britons.""
Irish coins issued during the rules of Kings George III and George IV (1760 to 1830) displayed ""Hibernia"" (the Latin name for Ireland), as all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom at that time. Coins from other British territories may include their colonial names in Latin as well.
Latin inscriptions are common on most older European coins as well, including those from countries whose languages don't derive from Latin, such as Austria, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Poland.
French inscriptions may be found on French coins and also those from Belgium, Canada, French Guiana, or another French colony or overseas department.
Spanish inscriptions may be found on Spanish coins and also those from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela, or any other country formerly a colony of Spain.
Portuguese inscriptions may be found on coins from Portugal or Brazil, or from any other former Portuguese colony.
Not all countries use the Roman alphabet to write the legends on their coins, however. A good reference catalog can help you identify other alphabets, such as Arabic, Chinese, or Cyrillic, and which countries use them.

, A mint mark is a letter or group of letters indicating the city, state, or country where a coin was minted. The mint mark may appear on either the obverse or reverse.


Current American coins bear the mint marks P (Philadelphia), D (Denver), S (San Francisco), or W (West Point). Other mint marks, for coins minted during the 19th century, include C (Charlotte), O (New Orleans), and CC (Carson City). If the coin has no mint mark, it was likely minted in Philadelphia, which did not use a mint mark until World War II, and then dropped it again until 1968.
Spanish colonial-era coins marked with a capital ""M"" and small ""o"" were minted in Mexico, while a ""G"" represented ""Guatemala"" and a ""CUZ"" represented ""Cuzco"" (Peru). Sometimes the same mint mark represented different locations at different times, such as ""P"" representing Popayan (Colombia), Lima (Peru), or La Plata (Argentina). Other times, the same location may have had different mint marks at different times: Bogota (Colombia) used F, FS, SF, N, NR, or S during the two centuries coins were minted there.
Mint marks may also be positioned at different places on the same coin design at different times. The American Jefferson nickel displayed its mint mark below and to the right of Monticello on the reverse from 1913 to 1941, over it from 1942 to 1945, below and to the right again until 1971, and on the obverse to Jefferson's lower right after 1971.

, Coin reference catalogs can help you identify a coin once you have completed at least a few of the above steps. Good references for looking up coins where you're not sure of the country are the Krause World Coin catalogs, which have separate volumes for the coins of the 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. If you've identified which country the coin is from, however, you may prefer a reference catalog focusing on that country's coins.

When you are first starting out with making coin rings, you should practice with smaller coins, such as nickels, dimes, or pennies. This is just to get the hang of the process.
Quarters are a highly recommended coin because of their larger size. Look for quarters made prior to 1965, because until that point, quarters were made with 90% silver.Half-dollar coins are also a good option, again because of their size. It is still best to look for half-dollar coins made prior to 1965 due to their high silver makeup.Half-dollars are especially recommended for people with large ring sizes.;
,


A silver coin
A hammer
A vise (This is a tool that can be bolted down to a table or work surface. It has a clamp with a rod that can be turned to open and close the grip onto something, like the coins, in this case. It also has an anvil on the side opposite the tightening rod.)
A ring-sizing mandrel (This is a rod that is wider at one end and tapers down to a smaller point. It is used to size rings.)
A drill and drill bit (recommended size: 1/8” or 3/16”)
A handheld rotary tool (A rotary tool is a small, handheld device with a small rod that sticks out of the tip. Different parts can be added to the tip based on what you want to do, like file something down, polish it, et cetera.)
A carbide cutting bit (This is a particular type of bit used for cutting through metal and can be attached to the rotary tool.)
Calipers (Similar to a ruler, this is a measuring stick that has moveable arms. The arms are used to measure something, so you expand or narrow them to whatever the object is.)
Sandpaper (recommended grit: 200-600)
Felt polishing tip and polishing compound

, Stand it up on an edge so that you can tap the edges with the hammer.You can secure the coin in the grip of the vise to reduce the risk of hammering a finger or thumb in the upcoming steps. However, you will have to stop very frequently to turn the coin in the vise so that you tap all around it evenly.
You can also grip the coin between your index finger and thumb to keep it in a standing position and prevent it from moving. This can be unsafe, as you run the risk of hammering a finger, so take care. Have an adult do this for you, if you are a youth.

, Lightly tapping is an absolutely essential component of this step.Tapping too hard on the edges causes the coin to become warped, and it is extremely hard to repair that mistake.

, Try to avoid tapping the same spot on the coin repeatedly, so as to avoid making one edge of the ring too flat.Rotate the coin slightly with every tap. You can gently turn it toward you or away from you as you go.
After about 10 minutes of tapping, you should observe that the reeded edge (i.e. the lined edge) has started to flatten. Eventually, those reedings should disappear altogether., This could take up to two hours, so prepare yourself for this time-consuming process.Eventually, the text on the edge of the coin should start to wrap around what will soon become the inside of the ring.
The coin should continue to shrink in diameter while the band of the ring continues to flatten and widen from the tapping.
Half-dollar coins take even more time to tap, as they are larger than a quarter, so keep this in mind when you choose your coin.

, Despite tapping lightly, it is possible that the coin could start to warp a bit. Be sure to check for warping periodically so that you can correct it early.Lay the coin down flat on the vise. Bend down to the coin's level and check for space between the coin and the surface. You can correct very minor warping with sanding later, or you can try corrective tapping to amend the warp if it is a bit bigger.

, Use your calipers to measure the inside diameter of the coin, but before you go too far with tapping down the edges, be sure you know what ring size you want the coin to become.14.1 mm = size 3
14.5 mm = size 3 ½
14.9 mm = size 4
15.3 mm = size 4 ½
15.7 mm = size 5
16.1 mm = size 5 ½
16.5 mm = size 6
16.9 mm = size 6 ½
17.3 mm = size 7
17.7 mm = size 7 ½
18.1 mm = size 8
18.5 mm = size 8 ½

, This refers to the outer edges of the band curving down slightly.Stand the coin on the flat surface of the vise again and lean it at about a 75-degree angle. Lightly tap the edges as you did before, except this time, tap them down toward the center of the ring. Remember to rotate as you tap to avoid tapping the same spot consecutively.
Flip the coin to its other side and repeat.
Check that the curvature is uniform by holding the holding the coin upright and rotating it in your fingers, focusing on the curvature all the way around.

, Before moving any further in the development, it is important to stop and smooth the outer edges of the coin from any waviness or warping.Use a 200-220 grit sandpaper, and lay it on a flat surface. Then, lay the coin flat on one side on the sandpaper, and gently move it in a circular motion to soften the edges. Avoid taking too much off the edges because you will start to lose some of the text and other features of the coin. Then, flip the coin to its other side and repeat.

, The towel protects the edges of the ring from the vise. The coin should be flat, as if it is laid on its side, not standing up.Take care to grip the vise tight enough to hold the coin in place but not so tight as to cause warping.

, Be sure to push all the way through the ring, taking care not to push so hard that the coin slips out of the vise.Use a drill bit size that is compatible with your carbide cutting bit. The suggested sizes are listed in Step 2.

, Run the rotary tool at a high speed so that it cuts out the middle smoothly and cleanly.Be very careful with this step and pay much attention while you are doing it. If the cutting bit slips out, it could damage the inside of the ring in the process, causing you to lose some of the coin face and text that make it so unique.

, As you get close to the edges of the ring, slow the rotary tool a bit.Rotate the ring inside the vise to ensure an even circular diameter inside the ring.
Occasionally take out the ring and check its size on the ring-sizing mandrel. If you do not have a mandrel, then try it on your own finger.

, By now, there is likely a sharp edge at the transition where the half round starts, so take time to sand it down.Slip the ring over the tip of your index finger and begin sanding the transition at the half round. Start out with 200-220 grit sandpaper and work your way up to about 600 grit sandpaper.
The more sanding you do now, with finer grit sandpaper, the less polishing that needs to be done on the band of the ring.
Do not sand inside the ring, as you will lose the details of the coin face and text.

, This frees up an edge of the ring for polishing without having to hold it.Rub polishing compound on the ring with a paper towel. This prepares you to polish it with the polishing tip.

, Hold the rotary tool so that the sides of the felt polishing tip rub against the ring.Rotate the ring occasionally so that you polish all the way around it. You will have to continue to apply polishing compound as you reach new sections of the ring.
Polish until you remove all of the sanding lines and the ring is extremely shiny.

, Now you can polish the inside of the ring.Apply polishing compound inside the ring, and then polish it with the rotary tool and felt polishing tip.
Remember to put the grip tight enough to hold the ring but not so tight as to warp it.

, DIY rings are a bit more susceptible to scratches, so taking the time to polish it every couple of months will keep it in good shape.

Drill your hole through the scrap wood and the coin.Push the drill all the way down through the secured top board and through the coin.,

Polish the ring once it has reached the shape and size you desire.You can polish the ring with a soft cloth, or you can use a polishing compound and felt finishing tip on a rotary tool.",How to Make a Coin Ring2," Small coins, such as pennies and dimes, are not recommended.


To get the hang of making a coin ring, it is recommended to practice with smaller coins, such as nickels, dimes, or pennies.
Quarters and half-dollar coins are the most recommended coins due to their size.
Be sure to find a coin that is made with 90% silver. Usually, these coins were made prior to 1965., Be sure to work in a space where you can use tools, such as a drill, as they can be loud and messy.


A silver coin
A hammer
A ring-sizing mandrel (This is a rod that is wider at one end and tapers down to a smaller point. It is used to size rings.)
A drill and drill bit
Calipers (Similar to a ruler, this is a measuring stick that has moveable arms. The arms are used to measure something, so you expand or narrow them to whatever the object is.)
A blow torch (A blow torch is a canister with a long, thin nozzle coming out of the top of it. When it is turned on, a bright blue, very hot flame comes out of the nozzle.)
A couple of scrap pieces of wood
Metal tongs
Protective gloves and goggles

, If you have a standing drill press, you can center the coin below the drill bit.Then, put a second piece of scrap wood carefully on top of the ring. Secure it down with vise grips.
Do not move the drill bit from its centered position above the coin.

, Then, lift the drill bit back out.


Recommended drill bit sizes are 1/8” and 3/16”.,


It is challenging to recover a coin ring if the hole is off-center. If this is the case, you may need to start over with a new coin.

, The purpose of this is to make the coin easier to mold and work with.When you are done heating it, the coin may have blackened. It will likely now look like a black washer.
Do not touch the coin with your bare hands until it cools.
Wear your protective gloves and goggles while you use the blow torch.

, You will use the mandrel to hammer the sides of the coin down, so it will only slide so far onto the mandrel for now.


Set the tip of the mandrel on a piece of scrap wood to hold it in place. This reduces the risk of the mandrel moving around or jumping while you hit it.

, Turn the mandrel periodically so that you hit all sides of the coin, flattening it against the mandrel.The ring will be slightly warped from this, as the mandrel grows in size from one end to the other. Therefore, one side of the ring will be wider than the other. This will be fixed.
This will be tedious and time-consuming. Take care while you hit the coin not to damage or scratch it.

, Make sure that the smaller side of the ring is down on the wood and the wider side it up. This will make it easier for you to shape that edge down to a normal ring shape., The band will thicken as you hammer the wide edge down so that it is flat and the same size as the other side of the ring.This process will push the metal down, which will slightly alter the ring size.
Wear the protective gloves and goggles as you heat the ring again.

,


If you use a rotary tool, secure the ring standing up in a vise. Apply the polishing compound to the available side of the ring and polish. Rotate the ring occasionally so that you polish all the way around it. You will have to continue to apply polishing compound as you reach new sections of the ring.

Look at the date on the coin.,
Know the country of issue.,
Note how rare the coin is.,
Observe the demand for the coin.,
Examine the coin's condition.",How to Find The Value Of Old Coins1," In general, the older the coin is, the more it will be worth.


Not all coins have dates on them. Modern dating for European coins dates back only to the early 17th century.
Among coins that display dates, not all those dates are according to the Gregorian calendar. Israel and India each follow different calendars, and much of the Arab world uses the Islamic calendar. If your coin comes from a country that uses a calendar other than the Gregorian calendar, you'll need to use a date converter such as that at CalendarHome.com to find the equivalent Gregorian year.
Also, be aware that not all coins are minted during the years they display. American silver dollars showing an 1804 date were actually minted in 1834 and 1835 as proof coins, while silver dollars minted in 1804 actually show an 1803 date because the dies were still good.;
, Which country issued the coin can have an impact on the coin's value, depending on how prominent the country was historically or how able it was to mint coins. Many countries display the name of the country on either the obverse (heads) or reverse (tails). Although the country name may be in the country's native language or in Latin, or in an alphabet other than the Roman alphabet.


You can look up a country's local name at Nations Online to find the name it's known by in English. (The site displays names only in the Roman alphabet, however)

, The rarity of a coin also determines the coin's collector value, in many cases more than the age of the coin itself. A coin's rarity depends on several related factors:


How many of the coins were produced to begin with? The 1914D (""D"" for Denver Mint) Lincoln penny is a sought-after coin because only 1,193,000 of them were minted. Proof coins are similarly rare because only a small quantity of them need to be made to test the dies. Only 6 examples of the 1930 Australian proof penny exist today; the total number produced was probably not much greater.
Where was the coin minted? While certain mints produce coins for general circulation, other mints may produce only commemorative coins or be in existence for convenience. The Carson City, Nevada mint was established in 1870 to be near the silver produced in Nevada's mines and ceased operation in 1893, when the mines stopped producing silver in quantity. It produced fewer coins than the other U.S. mints, reaching a maximum of 2,212,000 Morgan silver dollars in 1878.
Has the coin's design changed? In its first year of production, 1913, the design on the reverse of the Indian Head (Buffalo) nickel changed from showing the buffalo on a raised mound to depicting it on a recessed line of prairie grass. Fewer of the recessed line coin were produced that year so they are more valuable than those with the raised mound, even though the recessed line design was used during the rest of the coin's 25-year production run.
Has the coin's composition changed? The 1943 Lincoln penny was minted with steel because copper was in short supply due to World War II; the pennies of the following 2 years were made from spent shell casings. (A few 1944 pennies were supposedly minted from steel but never placed into circulation.) The United States abandoned silver coinage in 1965 because of the rise in the price of silver, replacing silver dimes, quarters, and half-dollars with copper-nickel clad coins, although some silver-clad half-dollar and dollar coins were produced in the 1960s and 1970s.
Has the coin been recalled? A coin may be recalled if it was produced in error, like the 1913 Liberty Head nickel; only 5 of which are known to exist. It may also have been recalled for other reasons, such as when the United States recalled gold coins from circulation and melted them down.
Does the coin display minting errors? Generally, coins with striking errors, such as the die striking the coin planchet off-center or incompletely transferring the coin design, are weeded out by inspectors and destroyed, but some are released into circulation anyway. These error coins are prized by some collectors.

, Related to a coin's rarity is how interested collectors are in the coin. As noted above for the 1913 Indian Head nickel, even though such nickels produced from 1914 to 1938 bear the recessed line design, making the raised mound design rarer overall, collectors are more interested in the 1913 recessed line nickel because fewer nickels of that design were produced in that year.


Demand for a given coin can also vary according to where in the world a given coin collector lives or vary over time as the coin's popularity with collectors varies.

, The shape a coin is in affects its value; the better it looks, the more a collector is willing to pay for it. Coin condition is graded in one of two ways, by the Sheldon Scale or by standard descriptive adjectives.


The Sheldon Scale grades coins from one to 70, with one being the lowest grade and 70 the highest. Although it is used worldwide, some coin experts prefer the use of descriptive adjectives.
Descriptive adjectives range from the lowest grade of ""Poor"" to the highest grade of ""Mint State,"" with intermediate grades ascending from ""Fair"" to ""About Good,"" ""Good,"" ""Very Good,"" ""Fine,"" ""Very Fine,"" ""Extremely Fine,"" and ""About/Almost Uncirculated."" The step from Poor to Fair on the Sheldon Scale is small, one to two, while Good ranks no higher than six, Fine no higher than 15, and Very Fine no higher than 35.

Get rolls of coins from banks.,
Check pocket change for key date or error coins.,
Visit garage sales and flea-markets.,
Talk to older friends and relatives.,
Buy from coin specialists.,
Search in areas with tourists and immigrants.,
Make a metal detector.",How to Find Rare Coins," Trade in your paper cash for coins at any local bank. You might get old coins if the rolls have been in the bank for a long time. Occasionally, you'll find a rare or foreign coin that's been mixed up with the others.
, Familiarize yourself with the ""key dates"" of coin series, meaning the years that are rare and valuable. Although it's not likely, people have found rare coins worth hundreds, and even thousands of dollars in their spare change!


For example, in the US, coins marked with the mint mark S are almost always more valuable. 1942—1946 nickels are another item to look out for, as they are 35% silver and worth a little more than normal.

, Make regular expeditions to hit up all the used good sales in your area. Chances are you will find the occasional coin collection at a good bargain.


Fairs are a great place to look for coins. Ask a local tourist board if there are any happening in your area.

, Many people have a change jar or a coin collection stashed away somewhere. Talk to older people, especially people who have lived in the same house for decades. They may be delighted to show you their old coins, and let you keep some or split the profit if you identify a rare one.

Ask relatives for permission to search their attics, basements, and closets as well.
Let all your friends and relatives know that you'd love to see any old coins they find. Keep paper money or new change around, to trade for the change they pick up in circulation.

, Visit auction houses, antique stores, pawnshops, and coin collecting clubs to find rare coins for sale. This is the easiest way to locate a rare coin, but, of course, it won't always be affordable. Try searching once you have a small collection of your own and are interested in expanding your hobby.


Many dealers have ""bargain bins"" of coins that you can pick through. Although bargain bins usually contain common, lower quality coins, sometimes a rare coin slips through.
You can often buy special collectors' coins directly from the mint.

, If you're interested in foreign coins, be smart about where you look. Visit neighborhoods full of recent immigrants, and ask the cashiers in local stores whether they have foreign change they'd like to trade. Tourist hot spots are another place full of people who have coins they'd like to trade you.

Look at the sidewalk too, while walking through these areas.

, Metal detecting can be a low-budget hobby if you build your own equipment. You'll have to dig up a lot of junk before you find any coins, but where else in life will you get to find buried treasure?

Learn the laws of your region before you head out to the park. In many areas, metal detector use is illegal in certain areas. Some of your findings may also be illegal to take, in particular anything associated with human remains.

Consult a coin catalog.,
Have the coin appraised by a certified appraiser.",How to Find The Value Of Old Coins2," In addition to helping you identify old coins, many coin catalogs list values for the coins they display. You will need to consult as current a catalog as you can find, as the values will change from year to year.


A good reference for U.S. coins is R.S. Yeoman's ""A Guide Book of United States Coins,"" popularly known as the ""Red Book"" for its cover.
A good reference for world coins is Krause's Standard Catalog of World Coins.

, Certain numismatists (coin collectors) have been formally trained in how to evaluate coins to determine their conditions and values. You can find these appraisers by contacting a local coin dealer, using the directories of the Professional Numismatist's Guild or the Professional Currency Dealer Association, or using the websites of the American Society of Appraisers (ASA) or the International Society of Appraisers (ISA).


Familiarize yourself with the terms an appraisers' group uses for its membership. The ISA divides its membership into members, who are credentialed appraisers, and associate members, who are not. Members are further subdivided by their level of training and experience, with certified members ranking higher than accredited members.
You can expect to pay a fee for an appraiser's services.

Obtain a book that provides coin grades and pictures.,
Learn the grades of coins.,
Learn the ANA scale.,
Practice with a sample coin.,
Use large quantities of coins.,
Hold the coin between your fingers in good lighting.,
Compare your coins to photographs of coins at the different grading levels.,
Decide which grade most accurately represents your coin.",How to Get a Coin Graded1," Find one with sufficient strength, preferably at least 3x to 7x magnification. This will allow you to see the coin up close and to notice all of the little details that are important in discerning its grade., Some books provide information about which parts of coins wear first so that you know where to look for signs of wear or damage that may affect the coin's value. A recommended book is “Official ANA Grading Standards for United States Coins” by Kenneth Bressett because it shares the official standards of the American Numismatic Association and provides the foundation for other coin grading books., This is a skill that takes a great deal of practice and experience to master. But you can start right away to begin making progress and you will soon be able to roughly estimate a coin’s grade.Coins in poor (P), fair (F), about good (AG), or good (G) condition generally aren’t fine enough for collectors. These coins have a somewhat legible date and mint mark, but a good deal of the design is indistinguishable. However, they can be used to hold a place in a collection until a finer specimen is found.
Coins graded very good (VG) show a worn design but are generally attractive and free of gouges or other mutilations.
A fine (F) coin is highly legible, and the design is clear but a bit worn. These coins are attractive and desirable to collectors.
A very fine (VF) coin has only light wear with a very clear mint mark, date, and design.
An extremely fine (XF) coin has wear only on the high points of the design.
About uncirculated (AU), uncirculated (U), choice uncirculated (CU) or gem uncirculated (GU) coins are beautiful coins that range from very little wear to completely without wear.

, The American Numismatic Association developed a 70 point scale in the late 1970’s to help create more specific, universal standards for coins. This in-depth scale helps take out some of the guesswork in determining coin grade.Grades 1-15 are for coins with significant wear and are not very valuable.
Grades 20-45 include coins from Very Fine (VF) to Extremely Fine (XF) and only have light wear.
Grades 50-58 are considered About Uncirculated (AU) with very little wear and a good deal of “mint luster.”
Grades 60-70 are in Mint State (MS) and do not have any signs of wear. MS-70 means the coin is perfect, and this is nearly impossible to find in older coins., Find a sample coin at a dealership or coin show that is already graded. Try to find one that is a popular grade, such as MS-63 and study the coin with a magnifying glass. This will help you to get comfortable with a particular grade and be able to recognize it., The more you practice, the easier it will become. It takes time looking at many, many coins to develop a frame of reference and to be able to distinguish the intricate variations between coins. You don’t have to buy them all, but anytime you are at a coin dealership or show, spend time looking and asking questions about their grades. Fellow coin aficionados will likely be more than willing to help.

, Carefully turn it around while holding it at an angle for optimal light reflection. Look for any damage or signs of wear on the coin. Hold it under your magnifying glass and find any scratches. Take your time to thoroughly examine the coin., You can find pictures of coins of each grade online or in a book of coin values. Alternatively, you can ask for photographs from a dealer who is willing to teach you to grade coins., Based on the information you have, give your coin an estimated grade. It doesn't have to be exact, just in the ballpark. This is important because if you determine that your coin is less than Very Good (VG), your coin is likely not worth very much and having it professionally graded will likely cost more than your coin is worth. On the other hand, if your coin is in good condition, it might be worth a lot. You will especially want to get a professional grade on coins that are in Mint State (MS).

Look for half dollars minted before 1964 or between 1965-69.,
Use a magnet.,
Try the ice test.,
Do the ring test.,
Check for damages on the coin.",How to Find Silver Half Dollars1," The older the half dollar, the more it will be worth. Prior to 1964, half dollars contained 90% silver. In 1964, the U.S. Mint removed silver from all dimes and quarters. They also reduced the silver content in half dollars from 90% to 40%, which is the silver content for all half dollars minted from 1965-1970. Most coins minted after 1970 are not made of silver but are most likely nickel-clad half dollars.Kennedy 1964 half dollars are the last 90% silver coins minted by the Federal Reserve.
When you have find a half dollar, make sure its date matches the symbol minted during that period. For example, a Kennedy half dollar with a date before 1964 is likely a counterfeit.;
, Silver exhibits weak magnetic effects. If your coins stick to a magnet, they are most likely not silver.Your half dollar is more likely nickel-clad if it's strongly magnetic.

Remember that some metals (like aluminum or titanium) can look like silver and also have no metal qualities. When in doubt, bring your coin to a dealer who can determine its authenticity.

, Silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any common metal or alloy. If you place a piece of ice directly on the silver and it melts immediately (as if it has been placed on a hot object), your coin is most likely silver.Avoid performing this test outdoors. The ice test will be most accurate in a room temperature area.

, Flick your coin in the air and listen to the sound it makes as it hits the ground. Authentic silver will make a high-pitched ringing sound, like a bell. If it does not make this sound, the coin is likely a counterfeit., If the area is marred or looks like it's been tampered with, a counterfeiter may have altered the date. Don't trust a coin with lots of strange markings or scratches, especially if they're around the symbol or date. You may be dealing with a counterfeit coin."

, Getting a coin graded costs money. This is why you want to estimate its grade before getting a professional grade. If your coin isn’t worth very much, you probably don’t want to spend more on getting its grade than the coin is actually worth. But if your coin is valuable, then it is an important investment. The NGC and PCGS charge anywhere from $12 to $250+ per coin, depending on the coin’s value.

, If using a third-party service, mail the coin to be graded. Make sure you know a lot about the company before sending anything valuable to them. Protect your coin when mailing it. Place each coin individually in a 2.5” by 2.5” mylar flip. This will safely store your coin for shipping. Make sure to label each mylar flip with a sticker so that the service knows which coin is which. Pack securely and use registered and insured mail to send them. Keep the tracking information to be sure your shipment arrives safely., Depending on the service, the turnaround time can take up to a month. There are also often express options available that can grade your coin in about a week. Some services allow you to check the status of your coin online so that you can stay up-to-date on your coin’s progress., In the case that you believe your coin might be over-graded or non-authentic, most reputable grading services allow for resubmission. They will take another look at the coin and in the case that it has been misattributed, they will pay the market value of the coin at its originally assigned grade and refund the fee and postage. However, if they determine that the coin’s original grade was appropriate, you will have to pay for the fee of resubmission and will not receive any refunds., Package the coin as you would to mail it, but instead of shipping it, simply turn it in at a coin show to the service you wish to use. They will take it with them and then mail it back to you once it is graded. Be prepared to pay for return shipping and for the grading services when you hand it into them. They will likely have a form for you to fill out. Make sure to follow all of their instructions.To find a trade show, most coin grading services have a listing of these on their website. Simply take a look and see which one you would like to attend. Make sure to find one that allows on-site grading."

Choose a large corporate bank.,
Avoid rolls with coins returned in bulk.,
Look for banks that have hand-rolled half dollars as opposed to machine-rolled coins.,
Trade in cash for coin rolls at the bank.,
Search your rolls for rare half dollars.,
Develop a good relationship with local bank tellers.",How to Find Silver Half Dollars2," To find silver half dollars, you'll want to find a bank with circulated coins rather than freshly-minted coins. The best banks for circulated half-dollars are big-name banks with businessmen patrons. Corporate banks deal with large amounts of circulated coins and will have more on hand.

Banks that specialize in merchant business will often sell coin rolls to non-account holders. Smaller banks may be more reluctant.

, If your bank says that one person returned a large sum of half-dollars, they have probably been searched. Ask for rolls that have come from a variety of sources. These are more likely to have older coins., The latter are usually from the Federal Reserve and were recently minted. New half dollar coins are useless to you, as any half dollar minted after 1970 will not have silver. Ask your bank teller if these coins were newly-minted before you exchange cash for them., After you've contacted local banks, visit them and trade your money for half dollar rolls. If this is not your personal bank, bring paper cash to trade for the coin rolls. Keep track of the rolls so you can trade them back in after you've searched them.

Ask the bank tellers to give you the rolls that appear to have been sitting there the longest or are at the bottom of their stacks. You'll be more likely to find older coins.

, Remember key markers of a rare half dollar to find coins minted when the Federal Reserve used silver. Take care to search all your coins carefully and thoroughly. If you're unable to focus, consider searching the rolls at another time.

Don't search all the rolls at once. Take breaks in-between rolls to avoid carelessly missing a silver half dollar.
Store unwrapped coins in a specific place so you can return them back to the bank later. Losing track of coins can add up over time, and you do not want to make coin collecting an overly-expensive hobby.

, Frequent the same banks when trading your money for coin rolls. Over time, get to know the tellers and let them know what half dollars you're searching for. Ask them if they'll contact you when new half dollar rolls arrive."

Check local stores.,
Visit flea markets.,
Purchase half dollars from coin dealers.,
Use a metal detector.",How to Find Silver Half Dollars3," Antique stores are an excellent place to find vintage silver coins. Ask your local shop owners if they collect or sell ""junk silver,"" the antique term for old coins in good condition.If so, inspect their coin collection for silver half dollars. Thrift shops may also carry vintage coins, depending on their policies.

Ask friends who work in retail to put aside half dollars for you. You can come into their store and trade your paper money for their half dollars, which you can then inspect.

, Search in your local classifieds for flea market listings. When you arrive, move from booth to booth and look for vendors selling coins. If you find a silver half dollar, ask your vendor questions about where they obtained it and whether they have a certificate of authenticity for the coin.If you want to get up early on the weekends, check garage and estate sales. Someone nearby may be selling their personal coin collections. Yard sales aren't a guaranteed place to find silver coins, but you never know.

, Look for reputable coin dealers in your area and ask if they have silver half dollars for sale. Dealers often work with a variety of coins, and you're likely to find at least one who sells half dollars.

Find a dealer who is an Authorized Purchaser working with the U.S. Mint. This guarantees that your coin dealer is professional and safe. Most Authorized Purchasers have been in the business for over five years and have a strong client base. , Buy or build a metal detector and go searching in local areas. The best spots to look for coins are urban areas, like beaches, ski resorts, or campsites.Metal detecting will help you find a variety of old coins: you never know whether you'll get lucky and find a silver half dollar.

Heavily-trafficked areas are best for finding coins. While you can metal detect in the countryside or forests, you are unlikely to find what you're looking for.
For older coins, visit old areas. A building constructed in the last ten years might not have older coins, but a building fifty or more years old might have vintage coins."

Examine your dinnerware for the characteristics of china.,
Compare the patterns on your china with online examples.,
Look for consistency and evaluate quality in sets.,
Look for a back stamp or marker stamp.,
Use historical trends to your advantage.,
Get your bearings with a brief Internet search.,
Utilize references from a library or bookstore.,
Establish a likely period in which your dinnerware was produced.,

Avoid online appraisers.,

Get proof of your appraisal.,
Reappraise your items.",How to Identify Antique Dinnerware," Antique china will have certain qualities that distinguish it from other kinds of dinnerware. The two main factors that you'll be looking for include shape/design and the pattern on the china. These factors will change depending on the period in which they were produced.


Prior to the 1950s, most china plates were round, with the exception of some art deco pieces in the 1920s.
Generally, china will either have rimmed or coupe plates. Rim plate china contains a second circle indented inside the plate, while coupe plates are all one diameter in shape.;
, This can be especially helpful when you do not know the manufacturer of your china, as many patterns are unique to certain producers. You'll want to make sure the unique features, like corner-work and artistic flourishes, are the same between patterns.


Two examples of specialty company designs include Havilland, which was known for china with soft floral displays, and Wedgwood, which themed china patterns off portraits or classical Greek scenes., A complete set is often worth more than a single piece. However, different pieces that have similar patterns can often be mistaken as part of a set. Most sets are usually consistent throughout, including similar borders, corner-work, shape, and pattern.


While checking for consistency, you'll have a perfect chance to scope out the quality as well. An ideal set will be consistent in both pattern and color.
The glaze and construction are also a good way of determining quality. Glaze should not be bubbled or cracked, and the pieces should be completely level so that they don't wobble when laid on the table., This is the easiest way to identify the manufacturer of your dinnerware, although in many cases the stamps may have faded or become illegible.Once you know the manufacturer, you can look up the approximate value of the piece online.


The back/marker stamp is usually found on the bottom of the dinnerware. Look for a marking that is painted, impressed, or stamped on the piece.
Back/marker stamps can be very small, but these usually include an emblem of some sort, the name of the manufacturer, and possibly numbers indicating the class or date of the piece.
A good way of finding the approximate value of your piece is to search for an identical or nearly identical piece on an online auction to see its going value. However, this approximation may vary greatly from that of a professional appraiser.
If you find that your dinnerware is valuable, you might want to take it to a professional appraiser so you can determine the precise value.
If the stamp on the back of your dinnerware is illegible, you can compare its markings with more visible ones on similar dinnerware in an antique catalog at your local library or an electronic directory online.

, Certain designs were more popular than others historically. For example, dinnerware from 1900 - 1920 frequently had floral patterns featuring violets, pastel colors, and were rimmed with a shaped edge. Other trends that might help you identify antique dinnerware include:


Designs from 1920 - 1940, which often featured bright colors and geometric shapes. Pastel colors were still somewhat popular at this time, as well as ivory or cream white pieces with gold or silver gilding.
Designs from 1940 - 1950, which leaned more heavily on bold colors like red, blue, and green. Pastels were rare during this period. The shape most popular in this era was rimless and streamlined.
Designs from 1950 - 1970 rarely had gold trim, as the recent invention of the microwave made this impractical. Pastels returned to popularity, but were more muted than the dinnerware of the past., There are many websites that focus on selling or helping to identify replacement pieces for your china sets. You might use these resources to direct your research. These kind of sites often have an alphabetical list of china manufacturers in addition to pictures.


Online appraisal services are rarely able to accurately gauge the exact worth of your dinnerware.The best use for these online services is to get direction for further research.

, Digital images can be of low quality or difficult to scrutinize closely, so you may want to visit a library or the antiques/collectibles section of your local book store. Using references at these places, you can compare your dinnerware to other pieces to assist with identification.


Your local library may have a specific section devoted to arts and collectibles. This may be the best place to start your research.
If your dinnerware has a specific name stamped on it, such as Limoges or Wedgwood, you'll likely be able to find books about those particular manufacturers.

, Sometimes a piece of dinnerware can appear as though it fits in a few different periods. But once you narrow down your choices to a likely few, you can compare your piece to others in that period. If you notice many similarities, chances are good the piece was produced in that period.


In some cases, the back/marker stamp on the bottom of your dinnerware may give you the exact date of its production. This can help significantly with your research., If you see a small crack or some other kind of deformity in your dinnerware, you might be tempted to do a quick-fix repair or touch up. However, altering the original condition of your dinnerware could actually decrease its value.Even if the change you intend on making would normally be considered an improvement, this can result in a lower appraisal than the original.
Keep any parts, spare pieces, or broken pieces with the original piece. In some cases, you may be advised by your appraiser to have the piece repaired by a professional.

, Getting an item appraised online can be both cheap and time efficient, but the quality and attention to detail you receive will be less than a physical appraisal by a professional. To fully understand the condition of your piece, your appraiser will need to handle it.


If you're having trouble finding an appraiser or if they are too expensive for your budget, you might inquire with bank Trust managers or Estate Lawyers to find a suitable individual to appraise your dinnerware.
You should also avoid auction houses and dealers when getting your dinnerware appraised. These people may deflate the value of your piece with hopes of buying it from you cheap., Appraisers have different areas of expertise, so to get the perfect appraiser for your dinnerware, you might have to interview a few before you find the right one. Inspect potential appraisers' resumes to find how long they've been working with antique dinnerware, and check references to ensure you're not being misled.


After you've narrowed down the candidates for an appraiser, you should request a written estimate of how much the appraisal will cost and how long it will take.
Generally, a written report and full appraisal of your dinnerware will take about a month. However, high demand appraisers may need more time., This kind of proof usually takes the form of a written report. The contents of this report normally include the reason for the appraisal, the techniques used to value your dinnerware, a description of the dinnerware, and a precise value of your dinnerware's worth., The value of your dinnerware will change as time passes, so old appraisals may be significantly different from the current value. Additionally, market factors can change the value of your dinnerware. For example, if similar dinnerware has saturated the market, the value of your piece may have decreased.


In most cases, the written part of your appraisal should indicate the state of the market for your particular kind of dinnerware."

, Copy a line from the email and paste it in the search box of your browser. If you search for ""I actually observed my wife has been viewing your website"" you will find others that have received the same art scam form letter.,, A scammer may call it ""your piece of work"" or ""the item"". A scammer may suggest buying any piece of art that you recommend.

A scammer may ask for a specific work or art by name. Be vigilant regardless.

,,

Always give your bank enough time to clear a check. Be sure it is not a fake before you give up any goods.
Remember that a buyer can get PayPal to refund their money in spite of your objections.

, Firmly maintain your standard protocol as a reliable seller.

Do not change your policies because someone offers to pay you a high price.
Do not change your policies because someone is in a hurry.

, The scammer asks for a quick refund in cash or a money order, then a week later your bank calls to tell you that the buyer's check was no good.

Opening a new account with the scammer's check is a bad idea. The bank will charge back the fake check to you, holding you responsible for repayment of the full amount. The bank will not cover your losses.
Do not wire refunds through services such as Western Union or Moneygram. Sellers do not send money to buyers, they only send money to scammers.
Never agree to adjust your invoice for any reason suggested by the buyer, such as an additional amount to cover his agent's fee. The buyer must handle his own business. You handle your own business, including paying taxes on the invoiced amount.

, Do not provide your home address or phone number. Do not provide bank account information, credit card numbers, PayPal account number or social security numbers. Scammers can easily find much of your personal information. Don't help them or invite them. Here is a sample of a follow up email:
Dear seller,
Thanks for the message, Hope you are doing great. I actually observed my wife has been viewing your website (artwork) on my laptop and i guess she likes your artwork, Also I must tell you I am very much interested in the immediate purchase of that artwork to surprise my wife. Unfortunately, at the moment I am on training voyage with new hires, fresh from graduate school, I would have come to purchase the piece personally but won't be back for another couple of weeks, as I am a civil marine engineer and due to the nature of my work, visiting of website, phone calls are restricted during this period, but i squeezed out time to check this advert and send you an email regarding it:-). . Kindly email me the asking price asap.
If you'd like to know, I'm relocating to the Philippines soon and I'm also trying to gather some good stuff to furnish my new abode. I am buying yours (quickly before someone else grabs it) So, I'll arrange to send you payment ASAP.
However, you don't have to worry about shipment, I be appointing a secured shipping agent in Philippines whom are also moving my 1932 Ford ROADSTER and some personal effect to come over for the pickup of the painting at your place,and then deliver it to my new abode (Philippines); Courier service like FedEx, UPS are not worth it in the Philippines especially USPS all of them are not rendering good service there in the Philippines, they will never bring to ones house. I have had several bad experience with FedEx and UPS in the past and am not willing to pay additional fee at the delivery point in Philippines because the appointed shipper will deliver safely without paying any other money before collecting the goods unlike some other courier where it will not be delivered to your address rather you will have to go to their office to pick it up and when you get there you will be told to pay other money before collecting it.
Thanks and God bless,
Steve Scuba
PS:In the meantime, you could forward me your full name (you want the check payable to) cell phone no. and contact address so I can fedex a check to. as I MIGHT be delayed depending on how things goes.
Here is another sample letter:
Hello,Thanks for the details which Ive noted down and have also forwarded it to my shipper.He's due in the US sometime next week and will definitely be getting in touch with you for the pickup.The truth is,i would have handled this much differently if i would be at home but Im a bit pressed for time myself. Im moving to Cairo this month as im being transferred.As it is, I'm sending you an overdraft which will include my shippers fees as well.He has asked for an upfront before coming and since I have no access to a lot of cash, Im trying to kill two birds with a stone.So, once you've received and cashed the check,deduct your funds and PLEASE help me send the remaining funds to him(shipper).I'll forward his contact details to you once you've received the payment.Now I'm concluding you are a responsible person and I can therefore entrust you with this arrangement.Ill let you know Immediately the check is sent out to you so you should be looking out for it.P.S:I`ll require that a reconfirmation of your address is done for me now. I await your reply.
thanh Nguyen (mrknumb@gmail.com), A scammer may tell you that he does not have a shipping address because he is on a ship in the North Atlantic. A scammer may tell you that shipping is not required because he is moving to the Philippines using his personal shipping agent. A scammer may tell you that shipping to his home address is undesirable because it would ruin a surprise for his wife.

If a buyer is moving, ask for both the old and new addresses even if he does not want you to ship to either address. Explain that this is for validation and security, not only for shipping. Hey, if you want to know where I sleep, I want to know where you sleep.
Be suspicious if a buyer requests shipping to a different address.
Be suspicious if a buyer says he is at home with his wife surfing the web and also on a ship in the middle of an ocean at the same time. Watch for such contradictions as a sign of a scammer.

,, People have died while doing this.,

If someone comes to your home or calls your phone, contact your local law enforcement agency, police or sheriff.
If you have been defrauded over the internet, file a complaint with the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). IC3 is a partnership between the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C).

, It sounds entertaining and adventurous to bait a scammer for more information or to see how far the scammer is willing to go. However, it is safer and wiser to allow professional investigators to use their skills and training."

Decide what the focus of your collection will be.,
Look for trendy, quality designs of the time.,
Consider the essential features that increase the likelihood that the item will be viewed as an antique later on:



Awards: Keep a constant eye for award-winning designs and the source of the award for the design.,
Search for and purchase your items.,
Keep records of your purchases.,
Be prepared to store the items and retain them long-term.,
Store properly.",How to Find Antiques of the Future," Are you going to focus on furniture, kitchenware, bathroom goods, computers and accessories, personal accessories, or toys? There are many possible items that could be collected. The key things are:


Choose what you like. There is little point collecting things that don't resonate with you and your idea of style.
Hone down the parameters of your collection to avoid getting things that don't fit in.;
, An antique is something that is usually useful during its period, and often has a discernible production period, after which it will cease/has ceased to be produced.


Read magazines, style and product catalogs, and look online. Wide publication of an item in magazine product review sections, especially quality magazines, is a good indicator of the product's popularity and worthiness to be added to your collection.
Visit exhibitions that feature new products.
Learn the background of the item's designers. The more famous the designer, the better it will be to add the item to your collection.
Visit museums. Is your item already on display? This is a good sign! What other similar objects from other decades are on display? This will help to give you a good idea of how the items are valued by future generations.

, For example, designs that receive the prestigious National Design Awards from the Smithsonian Cooper-Hewitt Museum will give you an excellent idea of what's considered the best in design right now and in previous years, and is worth adding to your collection. Awards on an item will always set the item apart from the pack, and make them much more collectible.

Groundbreaking design: Something that didn't exist until this item came along, or a design that reshaped the future of an item, are really useful reasons for collecting it. The steady progression of Mac computers is a good example of product evolution that contains products worth collecting.

Elegance: Style should be something that lasts down the ages, and can be easily discerned whatever is the modern trend. If the item is the height of ""good taste"" at its time, then it's worth collecting.

Quality: The item should be well made. This should be obvious but isn't always heeded!

Unique: This is only applicable where an item is unusual and you'd like it form a part of your collection. Not every item in your collection has to be unique, although items should stand apart from their more generic copies. Unique tends to refer to ""hard to work out what it is"" because it has been designed so cleverly but it still retains a useful purpose. Vases, kitchen equipment, and storage items often fall into this last design style.

Science meets design: When science is used to produce an amazing design, the resulting product is usually worth adding to your collection.

, Once you know what you want to collect and you've done your research, it's important to locate trustworthy sources that provide your items at good prices.


Develop a relationship with a reputable local dealer who specializes in the items. Ask to be put on mailing lists, to be asked to special events, etc.
Learn how to find good deals online from both retail websites and auction sites. For auction sites, always do a thorough check of the seller's feedback first.
See if there are other possible sources, such as factory direct, special art and design stores, from the crafts person direct, etc. A lot of this is about establishing and maintaining good relationships – you can also form firm friendships along the way!
Look in sales ""just in case"". Don't rely on sales but do treat them as a possibility for finding an occasional item at a bargain price. This is definitely a fun part of the hunt!
Don't dismiss live auctions in your own area. Not everything sold at an auction is old – many household auctions are from deceased estates, as gifts, unused items stored with care, etc., are abandoned by distressed and already over-burdened family members who want it all off their hands. You can find modern quality items at some of these auctions too.

, Record the date of purchase, the cost, and any reasons as to why you bought it, such as because it was made by a certain designer, or because it was the last one of the manufacturing run ever, etc.


Don't rely on your memory – you're bound to forget over time! Add labels to items if in storage, as well as keeping a notebook.
Keep associated catalogs, postcards, advertising materials, etc., as these will add to the value and can sometimes be an antique in their own right.
Always keep items in their original packaging or boxes where relevant. This always increases the value in the future.

, If you cannot hang onto something of value, then it won't gain its antique value over time. Patience – and space – are a necessity!


Be prepared to keep these items pristine. They should not be used (with the exception of furniture but still be careful!). If you want to use the item, buy one for use, one for collecting.

, Items will deteriorate when exposed to the usual daily effects of light, moisture, human traffic, etc.


Keep out of the way of children, pets, and meddlesome family members.
Create a clear and safe storage space.
Consider the effects of sunlight on your items – usually it will fade items, so try to keep them out of sunlight.
Choose between display and storage. When on display, ensure that the display space is safe, clean, and out of sunlight.
Anything with paper should be stored flat and out of sunlight, along with insect deterrents. This includes books, postcards, magazines, catalogs, etc. Keep loose or fragile paper items in acid-free plastic sleeves.

, Again, no matter what size your gift is, you need to ask if you want it all to go to one place or you want to spread your philanthropic dollars among several places. One year you might decide do it one way and the next year you change your method. You might want to give 50 percent of your total to one charity, and the rest to several others. One possible way to think about this is consider the benefits you receive for each level of gift. Besides the personal benefit of giving, if you want the social benefit of your name on a list, or on a wall, you need to find out what amount of gift is necessary for each level. Some donations will bring you more social activities. On each charity’s website you can see the benefits of giving list.

, You have broad interests, but limited money. Do you want to focus on one art form, such as theater or museums or orchestras or opera or poetry or dance? Or maybe two arts? Usually, donors choose what they love the most, what they are most familiar with. They concentrate their giving where they can feel, and see, it the most. But sometimes a special program pops up that just moves us. Sometimes a friend or a child is personally involved in a different art, and you want to widen your focus to support that.

, Most arts donors give locally, because they know and enjoy those organizations and see the value they give their local community. You can also include places where you vacation or visit family frequently. Or you can consider important but more distant arts institutions that relate to your local favorites—perhaps regional theater or a summer writing program—or that are in high poverty areas. And no matter where you live, you may want to consider large national and even international institutions, because you know they are proven stars of the arts field. And don’t forget advocacy groups that work every day to improve the political and public environment for the arts in America.

, Do you want to support the finest, largest, most polished art organization in your geography? Or do you like the idea of experimental, scrappy, rough-on-the-edges art groups? Do you want to help children specifically? While some organizations exist solely for children, others have children’s programs. Some donors feel safer supporting the larger, more established charities having the largest audiences, while others feel that need looms greater on the artistic fringes or with smaller organizations. You need to give where you feel your gift will do the most good according to your philanthropic style.

, Now that you’ve identified the amount you will give and your favorite (1)  art(s), (2) geography and (3) giving style, you have probably already come up with several names of charities. If you have your final list for now, then skip down to the next step. However, if and when you need more names to pick from, here are some suggested research ideas:


Conduct online research combining your art form plus your geography and see what comes up. For example, “museums Bronx” or “poetry California” or “theater Asia” or simply “arts New Orleans”.
Read with more focus on the arts of your preferred geography. Of course, check out the arts and culture articles in your local newspaper, but also look at online blogs, websites and reviews.
Make sure you are familiar with all the local examples of your preferred art forms. Get out more and see them personally. See where dollars are spent. Ask the staff what they like best about the place. If you are thinking of eventually giving a large gift, start small and get to know the place and its dreams (unless you want to gloriously surprise everyone and bring tears of joy to their eyes).

, You are looking for exciting arts programming, excellent and ethical management, and fiscal health.


First thing, look at their websites. Remembering that not all charities have had the funds to keep updating their online presence (because they are spending on direct programs), see if you are drawn to their mission, goals, activities and style. Are they conservative where you are conservative and daring where you like to be daring? Would you like to help them do more? How have they changed over time? On the website, you can find how to give online or where to send your check.
Conduct online searches for news reports and gossip about your favorite charities.
Remember that most American charities are well-run organizations filling a need in our society. Ticket prices and entrance fees cover only a small portion of a creative organization’s expenses. They need to pay necessary costs for accounting, human resources, websites, building up-keep, marketing and advertising (ironically, the first line item to be dropped for cost savings) even between exhibitions and programs.
However, pay attention not just to the vitality of the art programs, but also to their financial and management health. By law, U.S. charity financial records are public. Thankfully, one organization (a non-profit) has put them all on-line, for free. Guidestar.org holds years of IRS returns for more than 1.8 million non-profits. At the most basic level, Guidestar can tell you whether the organization has filed its forms or not.
Research two other leading sources of information: Charity Navigator and the Better Business Bureau.

, Some ways to be truly engaged include:


Become a member.
Attend member events and get to know several layers of staff.
Volunteer at events; help the staff with whatever they need most. Learn what they wish the organization would do.

Try to acquire artifacts.",How to Create a Home Museum1," Native American pottery or other relics from ancient cultures can be pretty hard to find and are very, very expensive to buy. Using taxidermy specimens, mineral, or fossil specimens is a good bet.


Taxidermic specimens are insects in alcohol or stuffed animals. You can prepare these by hunting or finding dead animals. For birds, mammals, and sometimes reptiles, such as crocodiles, and maybe sharks, you can stuff the specimen. For mollusks, insects, spiders, fish, salamanders, frogs, toads and lizards, you can put them in special preservatives.
Rocks and Minerals can be found very easily in mines, mine dumps, rock piles, caves, mountains and quarries. If you do not live near any of these you can wait for a trip, collect everyday use rocks such a coal and limestone, or go to a special rock shop or gem show. If you want to make your rock more shiny you can buy special equipment
Fossils are the remains of ancient animals and plants which turned to stone millions of years ago. Fossils are commonly found in rocks such as limestone, sandstone, and shale. When you find your fossil, wrap it in newspaper and tape, to make sure it does not get broken. You can prepare you fossil with a toothbrush and dental tools. If there are no fossils in you area or you cannot collect them, you can also get them at rock shops and shows;

Research your own collection.,
Document your art.,
Ask for referrals to good art conservators from museums, historical societies, or other organizations responsible for cultural material.

,
Go to the website of the AIC (American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works) http://www.conservation-us.org where you can find links to helpful information about caring for your artifacts, about choosing a conservator, and even an online registry of professional art conservators in your region.

,
Eventually, you will need to decide if your art is worth the expense of having it treated professionally.",How to Find an Art Conservator," Know what you have and how old it is. If you have been unable to do this on your own, consult with museums or find curators or other professionals that may know. Many can help identify art from good digital photos.;
, Start a folder for each object and keep all documents together like receipts, certificates, historical notes or labels, and old photos. Learn how to take good digital photos yourself and include some sort of scale in the picture, or record measurements in three directions. You should be documenting your collections for insurance purposes anyway. Take close-up pictures of maker's marks, interesting details or damage for future comparisons.

,,, A good appraiser can give you an idea of market value, but only you can decide if it is worth it to you. Some things to remember are that artworks often become important heirlooms to later family members. Broken/damaged art usually has little market value and can be reminders of painful events. Finally, if we own important historical or artistic works, it is our duty to look after them properly.

Consider the context.,
Look for vertical and horizontal space.,
Keep fragile items safe.,
Place sturdy items out.,
Keep away from direct sunlight.,
Group similar items together.,
Weave a story.Some antiques may not be directly related to one another, but if you arrange them carefully, you can tell a story that links them together.,
Coordinate by color.,
Stack sturdy items together.,
Frame conventionally or creatively.,
Avoid clutter.,
Reflect light.,
Mix in modern items.,
Avoid stressing the item.,
Switch it up.,
Clean regularly and carefully.",How to Display Antiques," Every antique once served a practical purpose. Think about what purpose that antique once served and choose a room in your house in which it would naturally belong based on that analysis.


For instance, a display of antique dishes and silverware would seem perfectly natural in a dining room but may appear misplaced in a spare bedroom. An antique quilt, on the other hand, would fit in with the décor of a bedroom or family room but might look odd in a dining room or kitchen.;
, The eye typically looks for blank wall space in square-like dimensions, but oftentimes, there are large patches of empty space that run in either a predominantly vertical or predominantly horizontal direction.


This primarily applies to antiques you'll hang on the wall, like platters and pictures. Many homes have sections of unused vertical wall space along stairways and near doorways that you can liven up with the right antique display.

, Antiques that can easily be damaged when knocked or handled should be kept in a protected area, but there are still ways to protect these collections while also keeping them on display.


Curio cabinets and similar glass display cases are probably the safest and most traditional option.
Tabletop terrarium boxes and heavy fish tanks are less conventional but equally safe. They also allow you to take advantage of spare space on a desk, shelf, or table.
A high shelf can work well enough for moderately fragile items that you want to keep away from kids and pets, especially if these shelves are kept in an area that sees very little foot traffic.

, Sturdier antiques that can withstand the occasional bump or tumble can be kept out in more visible areas, but it can still be a good idea to avoid placing them in high-traffic spots of the house.


Antique books, suitcases, candelabras, and durable statues are a few examples of objects that can usually be kept out of protected areas.
End tables placed in guest bedrooms or coffee tables placed in secondary dens are usually fairly safe options to consider. Shelves can also work well as long as you can keep kids and pets away.

, Many antiques can fade, dry, or otherwise take on damage when placed in direct sunlight for extended periods. Ideally, you should display your antiques in an area with relatively low amounts of light.This is especially important when dealing with antiques that have been dyed, painted, or otherwise colored. Examples of such objects include antique quilts, photographs, prints, paintings, and painted statues or pottery. The colors of these objects will fade when exposed to bright light.

, If you have multiple antique collections, consider arranging them in separate areas based on nature and original use. The items in any one area do not need to be the exact same, but they should be related to one another.


For example, various antique teacups can be arranged in one area, even if the individual teacups differ in design. You can also display the teacups with other dishes since the original function of both collections are similar enough to work well together. A collection of antique teacups would work less well with something completely unrelated, though, like antique sewing supplies, books, or tools.

, This can require a lot of creativity, but the end result may leave a stronger impact than a more conventional display would.


For example, antique toys and antique clothing may not have a direct connection with one another, but if the toys and clothes are from the same era, you can paint a picture of life from that era. That picture can be further enhanced by including other antiques of the same era in your display, including dishes, jewelry, tools, or figurines.

, Group like colors or coordinating colors together to avoid displays that clash. Keep the color of the room in mind when choosing where to place the antique collection, as well.


A strong visual impact can be created when you display a large group of antiques in a single hue, even if the exact shades vary.
The objects in your display do not need to match, but the colors should at least work well together. For instance, if the majority of your antiques have warm hues (reds, browns, oranges, yellows), a single blue piece placed among the rest may look out of place.

, Heavy, sturdy antiques can often be stacked on top of one another to save space and create some visual interest. Never place any item that could break beneath something heavier, though.


A few examples of antiques that can typically be stacked include suitcases, trunks, and books.
As a general rule, the heaviest objects should be placed on the bottom and the lightest should be placed on top.

, Antique paintings, prints, and photographs will need to be framed, but you have both convention and unconventional framing options to consider. Additionally, there are other small objects you may wish to frame that would not usually be framed.


Look at both vintage and modern frames when displaying antique pictures. The best styles will vary on a case by case basis.
Small antique pictures can also be placed in vintage glassware or beneath a heavy sheet of glass set over a modern coffee table.Vintage buttons and small pieces of jewelry can be framed over sample paint cards or similarly colorful backings.Vintage playing cards can be framed behind any glass surface.
Antique cookie cutters, pins, or similar items can be framed in three-dimensional shadow boxes., You can arrange antiques in clusters and groups, but avoid cramming too many objects into one space. Clutter generally looks bad even when it's neatly arranged.


You should be able to spot each individual piece when the entire collection is viewed from the front.
In addition to looking bad, clutter can also cause damage since it increases the risk of objects banging or wearing together.

, Since most antiques will need to be displayed out of direct sunlight, the display area may look a little dark. A safe way to bring more light into the space would be to position surfaces that reflect light behind and around the display.


Mirrors are the most common way to draw and reflect light. Antiques displayed on a shelf or in a cabinet can be placed directly on top of a large, flat mirror, or you can position one or more mirrors directly behind the objects on display.
Metal platters and trays are a less conventional option, but when polished well enough, they can reflect light just as well as mirrors would. This can be an especially great option to consider if you have antique platters mixed into a collection of other antique dishes.

, Your antique display does not need to consist entirely of antiques. When appropriate, weave in a few modern day items that work well in terms of theme, design, and color. The juxtaposition between old and new can create greater aesthetic appeal.


The modern items may serve as nothing more than a backdrop for your antiques. For instance, you could use new fabric to create a background for antiques displayed on a shelf, inside a frame, or inside a shadow box.
On the other hand, the modern items can be decorations that share the spotlight with your antiques. In this case, it's usually best to keep the antique items and modern items clustered separately within the same space. For example, for a display that combines vintage baseball cards with newer baseball cards, the vintage cards can be clustered together just above or beside the cluster of new cards, but both sets can share the same wall or shelf space.

, Try not to display any antique in a manner that stresses the material it's made from. If you notice some wear and tear on an item you've had on display for a while, change the display or put the item in storage.


For example, you should avoid hanging or draping an antique quilt. The weight of the quilt can cause the threads to break and fray. A better option would be to fold or spread the quilt out on a flat, relatively undisturbed surface., If you have multiple collections and plenty of storage space, it can be a good idea to swap out your collections from time to time. The collection you've had on display for the past six months can go into storage while the set of antiques you've had in storage during that time can then be put on display.


Make sure that your antiques are carefully packaged and protected when you place them into storage.

, As dust and other debris gets onto the surface of your antiques, you will need to clean the items in your collection. Make sure that you clean each antique in a way that will minimize the risk of damaging it.


For most antiques put on display, all you should really worry about is periodically removing the dust. Hard surfaces can be cleaned with a dust rag. Soft surfaces, like quilts and other fabrics, can be cleaned with a low-powered vacuum.
Be careful about “restorative” cleaning, though. Some antiques can decrease in value when you make repairs to them.

"
"
Be sure to label them.,
If you are going to put your specimen on display, create labels.",How to Create a Home Museum2," Sometimes you can lose track of your specimen's information, such as where and when it was found. It is good idea to keep track of your specimen in a catalog or database. Handwritten catalogs are usually messy and unprofessional. Use Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to create one of these. Put in the object's discovery date and place, if a fossil or artifact: age, and some interesting facts.

, As with the catalog, it is not a good idea to have your labels handwritten. On your label include the object's catalog number, general keyword, and location of discovery.

"
"
If you are building a museum, you will of course need a display of objects.",How to Create a Home Museum3," For ancient artifacts, try to piece them together with crazy glue. Stuffed animals can be mounted on wooden poles or in dioramas. Rock specimens can be displayed together or individually. Small fossils such as shells or leaves can be placed in a display case or cabinet, while individual bones of larger animals can be mounted as a skeleton. If bones are missing (they probably will be) you can make plaster copies of other bones or sculpt replicas out of clay.

"
"
Once you have acquired, prepared, cataloged, labeled, and figured out how you are going to display your specimens, you can start designing you exhibit.",How to Create a Home Museum4," Maybe try to have a large permanent exhibition, and have a couple small temporary ones, so guests have something new to see each time. Try too choose theme which interests you or is relevant to subject of you objects. For ancient artifacts maybe archaeology, For taxidermy maybe the diversity of life. For rocks and minerals, maybe the Earth. For fossils, maybe prehistoric life or geology.

"
"
Once you know your theme for you exhibit you could create a diorama.,
The first step of creating you diorama is the animals or people.,
The second step is to create rocks and plants.,
The final step is to paint a background.",How to Create a Home Museum5," Maybe even put some of the objects in the diorama.

, For animals you can buy replica or even real skeletons to use. Then place a thick layer of clay all over the skeleton and texture it to resemble skin and muscle. You could use real animal hair for fur.

, For rocks, sculpt plasticine clay and paint it to look like the real thing. Doing this or using real plants, would be good for trees and vegetation.

, If the diorama is at the center of you exhibit and there is not wall, you can skip this step. For the background use a large removable canvas and acrylic or spray paint. Paint mountains, more trees, rocks, and other animals in the background.

The first step of this last section is to prepare your exhibit.,
The next step is to figure out how much admission will be.,
Hire staff.,
Invite your friends and family to your museum.",How to Create a Home Museum6," Hang informative signs, set up you diorama, and put out your items for display.

, You will need to earn enough to run you museum and to make a profit, print tickets, and possibly pay your staff.

, You may need catalogers, exhibit design and preparation helpers, and docents. You may need to pay them.

, Maybe give people special memberships. You could even go a step farther and open you museum to the public!

Tape your paper onto a covered work surface.,
Squeeze drops of paint along one side of the paper.,
Vary the drops’ sizes and colors to create patterns.,
Spread the colors with a piece of cardboard.,
Fold the paper in half and glue on lettering.",How to Do Paint Scrape Art1," Tape a large sheet of wax paper onto a table or countertop to create a protected work surface. Then tape a heavyweight paper, such as cardstock, onto the wax paper. Since it’s taped to the surface, it won’t move around when you scrape it.You can also use a cookie sheet as an easy to clean work surface.;
, Grab some squeeze bottles of acrylic paint in assorted colors. Apply drops of paint along one edge of the cardstock, leaving the rest of the sheet blank.If the rest of the sheet is blank, you'll be able to drag the colors across the paper without muddying colors.

, Try arranging the dots in a staggered pattern, or at different distances from the edge of the paper. That way, the lines you'll make by spreading the paint across the paper will have a scalloped pattern.

, Scrape a small square of cardboard or foam board across the paper, starting from the side with the paint drops. Drag the paint drops across the surface in straight lines, curved patterns, or any design that suits your style.Instead of cardboard, you can use an expired credit card or old gift card., To create a card, let the paint dry then untape the cardstock from the wax paper or cookie sheet. Fold it in half so the painted sides face out, and choose the side you like best for the front. Grab some letter cutouts or stickers, and glue or stick them onto the front to spell out a greeting."

Look for your carnival glass pieces.,

Decide where to display your carnival glass collection.,
Join carnival glass clubs.",How to Collect Carnival Glass," The colour is an important part of carnival glass and affects the appearance of your collection as a whole. Start by looking through the base of the glass to identify the colour accurately. Ensure that the lighting is strong so that you get a real view of the colour. Common colours are marigold, amethyst, green, and blue. Less common colours include peach opalescent and aqua opalescent. There are also many other possible colours including lavender, smoke, ice blue, ice green, lime, black amethyst, amber, moonstone, green and yellow (Vaseline), and many variations on shades and colours.

Do you want to collect any colour or would you rather concentrate on a few colour types? Perhaps rare colours are your preference, or a colour that fits in with your home décor theme.;
, There is a huge variety of shapes to choose from. When collecting, you might like to confine your collection to certain styles, or to figurines, crockery, etc. Here are some of the possible shapes:

Bowls, plates, tumblers, pitchers, and vases
Beads, hat pins, brooches, buttons, purses, jewelry, and beaded dresses
Lamps
Swan salts, money boxes, powder bowls, soda or whisky bottles, toothpick holders, cuspidors (spittoon, snuff, tobacco), perfume atomizers, etc.
Special event/commemorative items

, Patterns can form an important part of your collection too. With over 500 distinct patterns on carnival glass, there is a lot to choose from. Patterns include geometric shapes, flora, and fauna.

Flower patterns often focused on pansies, roses, iris, tulips, thistles, waratahs, and poppies

Fruit shapes included apples, pears, peaches, berries, cherries, and strawberries
Animal shapes included lions, horses, fish, bears, kangaroos and other Australian native animals.

, Modern glass cannot replicate the iridescence of the old carnival glass. This is due to the reality that the chemicals used are now considered health dangers. Modern day carnival glass can be discerned from the older glass by an experienced collector and still has its place in a collection if wished. The only downside to this is that there isn't very much of modern carnival glass to collect., There is a range of places where you can shop for antique carnival glass:

Look at online auction sites. They will have many choices available. Be sure to check shipping costs and liability for breakage in transit.
Visit antique stores. Find out which ones specialise in carnival glass by looking online, phoning, or asking when you visit antique stores.
Attend live auctions where quality vintage goods are sold. There will often be carnival glass pieces; call the auction house ahead to find out what it has on offer, or to find out when they think they'll have carnival glass to auction.
Ask around family and friends. You never know what they've got stored in their attics. And once they start seeing your collection, undoubtedly they'll remember whether they have a piece or two to spare you.

, Obviously glass is fragile, so you'll need to set aside a suitable place to display it that is safe and unlikely to be in the way. A cabinet with glass doors is an ideal display piece, or perhaps along shelving of a bookcase or attached to a wall. If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, attach the pieces to the shelving using art or poster tack., Meet other collectors and share stories, tips, and ideas with one another. You will also have the opportunity to make trades and to learn a lot about your collection.

Find out whether there are ways to display some of your favourite pieces from your collection so that you can share the joy of collecting with others.

Understand that Price does not equal Value.",How to Collect Art," What makes art good will vary from person to person.
, Random pictures from random artists are just that... Random. Think about what things attract you to a picture. What is/are the common theme of the pieces that you find appealing? Pastoral scenes? Abstract? Well defined facial features? The treatment of light and shadow?, Narrow down your search to general categories... and then catalog that category into it's sub groups. Doing so will focus your collecting efforts and give you some parameters by which to judge any potential addition to your collection.

For example: Find the type of art you like, then make a list of artists who create that type of art. Separate the artists by time period, geographic area, etc.

, Where did they live? What sorts of things influenced their art? Where did they create? All of this type of information helps you know where to look for more of their work., Art Museums, Art Galleries, Art Fairs etc are good starting places., You can purchase some very nice works quite cheaply... but you can also purchase some execrable works quite expensively.

",How to Collect Chinese Art," Like all the best collectibles, Chinese art requires an impassioned interest. Define your interests - your niche, if you like - to begin planning the collection that is right for you. You can do this by studying Chinese history, culture and the arts. Maybe start by reading an overview of Chinese art, subscribe to an Asian art magazine, investigate your local library, or talk with a Chinese art expert.;
, Visit galleries and museums - good places include the Freer and Sackler Galleries in Washington DC and the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. Many other museums have permanent Chinese art exhibitions, or temporary Asian displays so find out what is happening near to where you live. There are also a number of online galleries specializing in Asian art.

, If you can, book Asia as your next holiday. Places to visit include the Palace Museum in Beijing, the Hong Kong museum of Art, or the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan.


The Dashanzi Art District in Beijing is a fantastic place to find works by up-and-coming artists.

, As a new collector, you can buy wisely with modern works in the style of old masters, or contemporary artworks which reflect China's best artistic traditions.


At recent auctions, the value of Chinese paintings in these categories has been growing fast.

, Seek out biographical information. Decent galleries will provide detailed information alongside their artworks.


It is also worth seeking out reputed artists who've yet to break out into the international scene. Keep an eye on artists who are famous in their region of China.

, Read item descriptions carefully, as well as information on the artist. Closely examine any pictures that the seller sends, or closely inspect the object itself and note any imperfections.

, That is, unless you have the capital. American and Swiss buyers are still major players in the auction rooms for Chinese art.

, It is getting more and more difficult to find Chinese objects of collectible quality. So, if you see something that's unique, realistically priced, that catches your eye and stirs your passions - and you've done your homework - then grab it before someone else does.

, This may sound like obvious advice, but Chinese art can stir passion and addiction in even the hardest souls. Plan out your spending capacity for your prospective first year of collecting.

Color your entire paper with oil pastels.,
Paint the entire surface with black India ink.,
Scrape off the black ink to create a design or image.",How to Do Paint Scrape Art2," Cover the entire surface of a heavyweight paper with bright pastel colors. You can create any design, from rainbow stripes to polkadots. Just make sure you color the entire sheet of paper.For best results, press hard on the pastels when you color the paper.
If you don’t have pastels, you can also use brightly colored crayons., After you’ve colored the paper, paint the entire surface with black India ink.Give the paint time to dry after you’ve covered the whole surface.


If you don’t have India ink, try using black poster paint. Pour poster paint into a small bowl and mix in a drop of dish soap to help it stick to the pastel layer., Use a paperclip or popsicle stick to scrape lines into the black ink and reveal the bright pastel layer below. You can etch any shapes or designs you’d like. Try making images like stars and planets, a city skyline, flowers, or fireworks.Try experimenting with the paperclip and popsicle stick to create lines with varying thickness and fine details.

Use sgraffito to create hair and other linear details.,
Use a credit card or foam dipped in paint to create details.,
Blend horizon lines in a landscape by scumbling.,
Try making abstract works with scraping tools.",How to Do Paint Scrape Art3," Sgraffito is when a painter scratches through a top layer of paint to expose the pigment beneath. It’s great for linear details, like hair. Next time you paint a portrait, try using a thin painting knife or utility blade to scratch thin lines for your figure’s hair.When scraping away a top layer of paint, make sure the undercoat is completely dry or you’ll end up muddying your colors.

, You can use a scraping technique to create details like individual tree trunks in a forest. Try cutting up an expired credit card or piece of foam board. Dip the pieces in paint and dab or scrape them to create details.You can use oil or acrylic paint if you're using a credit card. Pieces of foam board work best with acrylic.
Try scraping them across the surface to create bodies of water or windows in a building.
You can also lightly dab the paint-dipped pieces right onto your composition to create trees, blades of grass, and other lines.

, Like sgraffito, scumbling involves using a knife to scrape away small sections of a painting’s top coat. First, try painting a sky in your painting's first coats, then use the next layers of paint to suggest a tree-lined horizon. Use a knife to scumble, or remove, bits of the treeline to create small holes where the sky peeks through branches.Scumbling works for oil and acrylic paints. To avoid muddying colors, make sure the undercoat paint is dry before scumbling over it.

, In addition to portraits and landscapes, paint scraping techniques are useful when creating abstract works. Try spreading layers of paint with a palette knife, spatula, or squeegee. Use the tools to scrape the surface and remove patches of paint, blend pigments, or create expressive gestures.Many great contemporary abstract painters use scraping tools to create improvised marks.

Once you receive your sword, immediately remove this grease with a lint-free, cotton cloth. Always wipe your blade in straight, one-directional strokes to prevent injury. Move from the bottom of the sword toward the tip, putting less pressure on the tip.When cleaning Japanese swords, use rice paper instead of lint-free cotton cloths. Coffee filters will also work as a cheap alternative.;
, Your lint-free cloth may not be enough to remove some dirt, dust, or gunk. This could include the factory grease. Pour a very small amount of lacquer thinner onto a different cloth and rub the gunk off, using the same straight, one-directional motions. Use another lint-free cloth to remove any remaining lacquer thinner., Japanese swords sometimes require slightly different cleaning materials than steel swords. Ensure that your lacquer thinner contains benzene when cleaning these items. , Using a fresh cloth, piece of rice paper, or coffee filter, completely dry your blade. This will remove any remaining dust and cleaning solution. Having a dry, clean blade before you oil the metal is essential for preventing moisture damage., All swords are highly prone to rusting. In order to protect the metal, these items need routine application of a protective coat of oil. Sewing machine oil, which is a type of mineral oil, is an easy-to-find and cheap option for preserving your swords., When oiling Japanese swords, you may choose to use more traditional cleaning and preservation materials. Choji oil is a type of mineral oil that also contains clove oil. This solution might be difficult to find and more expensive. Sewing machine oil will also work for these items., For both Japanese and steel swords, use a lint-free cotton cloth for oiling. Pour or spray a very small amount of oil on the cloth. Apply just enough oil to make a small circle on the cloth.To avoid over-oiling, you can also apply the oil directly onto the sword with an eye dropper., Use the same one-directional, straight motions as during cleaning when applying oil. Make sure the entire metal portion of the sword is covered in oil. Work slowly and carefully to avoid injury., Aim for a light coat of oil that just barely gleams when exposed to light. Oil should not be dripping off the sword. Ensure that your coat is thin and even by using a fresh cloth to cover any remaining bare spots and remove any excess oil., It’s important to constantly check and see how new swords react to your climate. Continue this process for about six months to protect the sword and allow it to adjust to your area. If it appears that your oil is wearing off, re-apply the layer immediately., If you live in an area that receives constant rain or high-humidity weather, take extra care with your metal. These regions put your swords at higher risk for developing rust. Rust can form quickly, so you may want to check the metal every couple of days, especially after you first make your purchase., Rust is a slightly less scary enemy in regions that don’t receive too much moisture. Still, water is everywhere! Don’t get too relaxed in these regions, and continue oiling your sword about once a month., While these pieces of your sword don’t require quite as much care as the metal, they may crack if they’re not properly maintained. To keep the wood protected and supple, apply a very light layer or lemon oil to the wood using a soft cotton cloth. You should only need to do this every six months or so. Increase the frequency if you notice any small cracks in the material., Just like wooden handles, leather handles may crack if they don’t receive a bit of routine care. Maintain this part of your sword by rubbing a small amount of leather wax paste onto the material with a soft cloth. As with wooden handles, you shouldn’t need to do this more than once or twice a year.Ensure that the oils you use to protect the metal on your sword don’t touch the leather handle. This can cause the leather to rot. You may want to protect the leather with plastic wrap whenever you oil the blade.

, If you’re not displaying your sword by hanging it on the wall, you may want to put it away in storage. To safely store swords for long periods of time, keep them out of their scabbards. Instead, apply a think coat of Vaseline, wrap the sword in several layers of rags, and tie the rags to secure them., If you’re worried about Vaseline damaging your sword, you may want to try Renaissance wax. This material is used by museums when they store their sword collections. It’s more expensive, but you don’t need to use as much when coating the metal. Wrap the sword in rags and tie once you’ve applied the wax.Renaissance wax can also provide long-term protection for swords on display.

, Extreme temperatures may damage your sword. Your sword will store best in an air-conditioned, dry space. These conditions will help avoid any rust from forming on the metal, and they should also prevent your handles from cracking.Do not store your swords in leather scabbards. This will quickly cause the blade to rust. While wooden scabbards are a better option than leather, they, too, will not protect the blade as well as well-secured rags and ties.

, While you may want to test your sword out by cutting trees or banging it against hard objects, this will damage the material. If you want to prevent scratches, do not engage in these practices. You may cause damage that even a professional sword polisher can’t fix.Some people choose to purposefully buy sturdier swords so they can handle them with less fear of damaging the metal. Even if you buy one of these swords, exercise caution and be prepared for damage.

, Any time you touch your sword, you’re exposing it to any natural oils or foreign material on your skin. While you should always clean and dry your hands before handling your sword, this will provide only minimal protection.If you’re worried about damaging the metal, you can wear cotton gloves when handling the sword. Don’t wear these gloves when cleaning, oiling, or polishing the sword, as they won’t provide you with the mobility you need to safely complete these processes.

, These pads come in coarse, medium, and fine grit. Attack small scratches or rust spots with the medium and fine pads, and use the coarse pads on deeper damage. You’ll want to slowly move through this process:Lay the sword down on a flat, secure surface. The tip of the blade should be facing away from you.
Rub the sandpaper over the damaged area in one-directional, straight motions. Focus on small areas, moving through them one at a time.
Finish with the fine abrasive pad to provide a satiny, scratchless metal surface.
Clean any rust dust off the metal with a soft cloth, and oil the blade as you normally would.
If rust develops on more expensive swords, call a professional. You don’t want to cause further damage to valuable items by trying to fix them yourself.

, If you want to create a mirror-like finish on your blade, put a small amount of metal polish on a Scotch-brite pad. Rub this solution onto the blade, moving only in straight motions. You’ll be tempted to buff the metal in circles, but resist this urge! Apply high pressure to the pad to receive the proper polish. Finish by cleaning and oiling the blade as you normally would., Japanese blades require a unique polishing process. When you purchase your blade, it may include an Uchiko ball, or a silk ball on a stick that contains stone powder. Gently tap the Uchiko ball against the blade every 1-2 inches (2-4 cm) to release a light film of stone powder along the entire length of both sides of the blade. Then wipe the powder off the blade with a clean cotton cloth, moving from hilt to tip in straight, one-directional swipes., If you don’t have access to this traditional Japanese tool, flour from your kitchen cabinet works as well. Simply sprinkle flour over the blade using your pinched fingers. As with the Uchiko ball, wipe the powder off the blade with a clean cotton cloth, moving from hilt to tip in straight, one-directional swipes., Any time that your blade becomes extensively damaged, get in touch with a professional. If you attempt to fix this damage yourself, you may end up ruining the item. Professional polishers can be found online, although they may require you to ship your sword to them. You may also be able to rely on local knife shops for repair, which may ease any shipping woes."

Learn the basics concerning how to prospect for gold in appropriate geographic areas.,
Research different areas to find out where gold is located around the world.,
Obtain permission before searching for gold nuggets on private lands or mining company lands.

,
Search for gold nuggets in places where gold has been found before.",How to Find Gold Nuggets1,";
, Ask your national, state or provincial geological survey website or office for information or maps.

,, Because so much land has already been prospected, you are unlikely to discover any brand new gold deposits.

Consider a high-frequency detector.,
Look for automatic ground balance controls.,
Choose a detector that displays the depth of the found object.,
Buy coils in multiple sizes.,
Purchase a pair of high-quality headphones.",How to Find Gold Nuggets2,"


High-frequency detectors are more sensitive to gold, but they are also more likely to give false positives when iron deposits are present.
Evaluate low-frequency detectors. Low-frequency detectors will tune out other metals and will find larger deposits at greater depths.

, These will adjust automatically according to the iron content in the rocks, and you won't have to constantly manually adjust the controls.

, This will help you to know precisely how far down you need to excavate.

,


Larger coils will find larger objects at greater depths, while smaller coils will find smaller objects at shallower depths.
Small coils are good for detecting deposits in bedrock while large coils are better at detecting nuggets buried in tailing piles.
Buy coils created for your model of metal detector. Coils are not interchangeable between models.

, A good pair of headphones will:


Muffle outside noise.
Enhance the faint sound made when nuggets are detected.
Possess a volume control mechanism.
Utilize mono or stereo sound depending on the sound output type of the detector.

"
"
Assemble your metal detector by following the manufacturer's instructions.

,
Practice using your metal detector at home.",How to Find Gold Nuggets3,",


Don't practice outdoors with the detector until you become proficient at operating it.
Place metal objects like bottle caps, can tabs, coins, nails and gold jewelry on a wooden table.
Run the detector over each object to get an idea of what the detector will sound like when it encounters these metals.

Transport yourself and your equipment to the area that you have chosen to prospect.

,
On the land move the metal detectors coils side-to-side and low along the surface of the ground.,
Perform overlapping sweeps.,
Treat all positive findings as indicators of larger deposits.",How to Find Gold Nuggets4,", Avoid sweeping in a pendulum pattern in which the detector comes up high off of the surface of the ground when it goes to the far right or far left in your sweeping pattern.

, If you do not slightly overlap your sweeps, then you may miss small deposits between swept areas.

, Gold rarely occurs in small swaths, so prepare to excavate more deeply if you find a small nugget.

Decide what you want to collect.,
Focus your collection.,
Research your collection.,
Shop for pieces online.,
Shop for items in person.,
Start cheap and work your way up.,
Know your items.,
Display your collection in curio cabinets.,
Organize your collection into binders.,
Hang your collection on your walls.",How to Start a Collection," The most important step in starting a collection is selecting what you want to collect. To do this, consider your interests. Do you like history? Maybe you would like collecting old stamps or coins. Do you enjoy reading? Perhaps you would prefer to collect books. Are you a big traveler? Maybe maps are more your speed. Whatever you pick, make sure it’s something you’re passionate about.


Other ideas of things you can collect include autographs, watches, wines, art, hats, figurines, cups, shot glasses, key-chains and postcards.
If you like spending time outside, try making your collection nature-based. Consider collecting seashells, rocks or pebbles, fresh flowers, acorns or leaves.
If you have inherited a small collection from a friend or family member, consider expanding on that.;
, Once you’ve made your initial choice, it’s time to narrow it down. Saying you’re going to collect books is too vague for a collection; instead, consider collecting used books or children’s books or first edition copies of books. If you’re collecting sports cards, only collect cards for a certain sport or team. The more focused your collection, the more challenging and fun it will be to hunt down your pieces.If you’re collecting rocks, try collecting the rocks by different rock classifications. If that’s too specific, you can collect based on factors like location, color, texture or shape., Before you buy the first piece for your collection, you need to know what you’re looking for. Spend some time online learning about the history of your collection. Talk to people in online forums about what pieces they have or are looking to buy. The more you know about your collection, the easier it will be to track down specific items.Find out what the most sought after pieces in your collection are and always keep an eye out for them.Decide if you’re collecting for investment or enjoyment. If you’re looking to make money off your collection, you’ll need to do far more research than if you’re just collecting items that make you happy., The internet has made shopping so easy you can add to your collection from the comfort of your own home. Start by looking in online forums; collectors are often willing to trade for new items or to sell items they currently own.


Ebay is a great place to look for pieces. You can pay outright for items, or bid slowly to try to get the best deal possible. The con to using Ebay is that you don’t get to see the item in person before purchasing.Craigslist is a great option to buy pieces as well. You can search by your location, or if you’re willing to travel a little further, you can expand your search to a nearby state. The added benefit of shopping on Craigslist is you get to see the item in person before committing to buying that item.

, While most mainstream stores won’t carry the niche pieces you’re looking for, there are still plenty of places to look. Try visiting Flea Markets in your area, as well as antique stores and thrift stores. On weekends, visit garage and estate sales. Finally, check online to see if there will be any collector shows happening in your area. Collector shows are great ways to meet people within your collection community, and possibly get a new piece out of the deal.


When shopping at antique or thrift stores, make sure you dig through every item. The gold is often buried amongst the garbage.
Arrive early at garage and estate sales; the best pieces tend to go early. Come back on Sunday, sometimes the owners of the sale will drop their prices to rid themselves of their inventory., Collecting can be an expensive hobby and many people dive right in. Instead, start off slow and aim to only pick up a few pieces each year. This will prevent you from wasting money, burning out and ending up with a lot of items you don’t need or value.Consider only adding to your collection while on vacation. This way, you tie pieces of your collection to fun memories from your travels.
Collect from experiences. Pick a collection that doesn’t cost any money. Consider collecting matchbooks from restaurants or coasters from bars. Collect seashells from your beach vacations or rocks from cool hikes. Your collection doesn’t have to be expensive to have personal value.

, When adding to your collection, learn a fact about the item you're adding. This will give you something to talk about when showing off your collection to others and will also make the collection experience more personal for you.When shopping for pieces, stock up on extras whenever you can. You can use these duplicates as leverage when trading with other collectors.
Part of having a collection is refining it. Edit out old pieces you no longer care about to make room for new ones. Sell the old ones on Craigslist or Ebay, or take them to a pawnshop to have them appraised. Use the money you earn to add a new piece to your collection.

, Curio cabinets are cabinets with glass doors, so you can easily show off your collection inside your home. But don’t just pile your entire collection inside; instead, try to tell a story using your collection. Showcase your favorite or most valuable pieces, or pieces that all fit within the same category.If you collect books, try sorting your books based on color or size, rather than subject matter, for a more interesting aesthetic.
If you don’t have room for a curio cabinet, spread your collection throughout a couple of rooms in your home.

, If your collection consists of small items, like baseball cards or stamps, try organizing them into binders. You can purchase specially designed plastic sheets that will make it easy to organize and store your pieces. The plastic sheeting will also make it easy for you to transport your collection and show it off to your friends.


Try using tabs within the binders to organize your collection by category. If you are organizing baseball cards, those categories can be dictated by different positions, teams or years. You can also sort the collection according to what condition each card is in.
Be careful to store your binders someplace safe and dry to keep your collection from warping or getting ruined.

, If your collection can be hung, try mounting it on the wall. Group your art collection together to create an impactful gallery wall. Hang shadowboxes on the wall to show off your vase collection. Hang floating shelves to display some of your favorite hats from your hat collection.If items from your collection are easily broken, take care not to hang them anywhere dangerous.
Update the items you are showcasing. As you buy new pieces, remove the old ones from your walls and replace them with the updated versions. This will keep your collection feeling fresh and exciting and will also serve as an icebreaker when people come to visit.

Rinse the quartz off with a power washer.,
Clean the quartz with a fabric gun.,
Scratch off dirt with a knife.,
Use an air abrasive tool.,
Try an air scribe.",How to Clean Quartz1," If you have a large amount of quartz with a heavy amount of mud or dirt on it, you can try to rinse it off with a power washer. Set your quartz on the ground (preferably on concrete or asphalt) and rinse off the dirt. Using a power washer is more efficient, but you can also use a hose. You can also go to a coin operated car wash and wash your quartz there with their pressure washers. After you wash it, let the quartz dry out. Repeat the washing process until the quartz is clean.


If there is only a small amount of dirt left on the quartz after rinsing, try scrubbing it with a brush and liquid detergent soap and water.;
, A fabric gun or spot cleaning gun can shoot water at the quartz at high pressure to help remove dirt. These are used in dry cleaning for removing stains and are available for less than 75 dollars. This works well for cleaning small amounts of dirt off of quartz that is in hard to get to areas. The fabric gun shoots a small amount of water at a powerful rate.


Make sure to wear glasses or protective goggles while doing this to avoid getting rock specimens in your eyes., If using water does not remove all the dirt from your quartz, you can try to scratch dirt off with a blade. Quartz is harder than a knife, so you won’t scratch the quartz. Using a binocular, microscope, or magnifying glass when doing this. Scrape off as much of the dirt as you are able to.


Be very careful when doing this, the blade may slip and cut your hand., An air abrasive tool will shoot something at the quartz at a very high pressure to remove the dirt. Use something in the air abrasive tool that is not going to damage the quartz. Instead of using other quartz or garnet sand, use tiny glass beads to clean the quartz. This will help prevent damaging the quartz and removing the shiny surface.You can purchase air abrasive tools online or at hardware stores, such as Harbor Freight Tools.Air abrasive tools range in price from around 20 to 90 dollars.Wear protective eye gear when using an abrasive tool., You can also clean quartz with an air scribe (a tiny jackhammer that is powered by compressed air) instead of an air abrasive tool. These remove chunks of dirt and material that might be stuck on your quartz. Air scribes often take only a few seconds to clean an area, rather than minutes or hours.Air scribes are very efficient, but can be more expensive.Cover your eyes with goggles or glasses."

Remove stains from your travertine floors.,
Use water to clean outdoor travertine.",How to Clean Travertine1," The high traffic areas of your home with travertine floors, such as a doorway or a hallway, are more susceptible to damage. In order to keep your floors pristine, it is necessary to provide additional protection to high traffic areas. Protect these areas from abrasive dirt and damaging grime with seasonal doormats, sleek runners, and timeless area rugs., Travertine floors are easily damaged and must be cleaned with care. To maintain a well-kept floor, vacuum, dust, and sweep your travertine regularly.


Never drag an upright or full sized canister vacuum across your floor to suck up debris. Instead, suck up abrasive debris that might scrape your floors, such as dirt and gravel, with a handheld vacuum.
Remove dirt and debris from your floors with a dry dust mop.

, When washing your floors, only use a soapless, neutral PH 7 mild abrasive cleaner and water. Always follow the product’s instructions. Use broad sweeping motions that overlap to clean your floor. Dry and polish with a clean microfiber cloth.


To deep clean your floors, you may use an automatic scrubber with disk brush attachment., As a porous stone, travertine stains easily. After identifying what caused the stain, use specific products to remove the blemish.


Oil-based stains darken the stone and must be removed with chemicals. Blot the stain with a clean cloth to remove any excess residue. To remove the stain, use a soft liquid household cleaner, such as ammonia, acetone, or detergent. Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the oil-based product.Organic stains, such as those caused by coffee, juice, urine, and food, turn the travertine pink or brown. Remove these stains with a mixture of 12% hydrogen peroxide—food grade hydrogen peroxide—and a few drops of ammonia.Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the organic stain.The method for removing ink stains varies based on the color of the stone. If the stain is on a light colored stone, use bleach or hydrogen peroxide; if the stain is on a dark colored stone, it is best to use acetone or lacquer thinner. Apply the product to the stone on a damp cloth. Place the cloth over the stain to draw out the ink stain.To remove water stains, buff the blemish with #0000 steel wool.Before you can remove etch marks, you must thoroughly remove the acid that caused them. Once the acid is removed, wet the surface and use a buffing pad to apply marble polishing powder. Buff and polish until the marks are gone., Clean travertine installed outdoors at least once per year. Rinse the stone with water to remove excess dirt and debris. To clean travertine that is not regularly maintained, use a pressurized water hose to remove caked on dirt."

Think outside the box.",How to Dig for Fossils," You cannot dig in solid rock, nor would you expect to find fossils in the local playground, but it could happen.;
, These do not usually permit you to dig and remove any specimens.

, They are often happy to share their knowledge with you. Museums and libraries are also good sources for diligent researchers.

, This might include a mason's hammer, shovel, pick, brushes, a sifting pan or box with a hardware cloth bottom, and a notebook.

, Fossils are simply impressions of animals, fish, or plants which have become part of the local rock, usually found in sedimentary rock. This rock is formed over a long period of time by deposits of silt and mud which have hardened to its present state.

, Silicates and basalts, which are shiny and fairly consistent in color and composition usually don't contain fossils, however, limestone consists mostly of calcium carbonate and can be a rich source. Fossils of sea shells and marine animals are common in the limestone used in highway construction, from grade aggregate, which is small pieces usually less than 2 inches (5.1 cm) across, to rip rap boulders used to stabilize drainage ditches.

, We all would like to find a T-rex tooth or a Velociraptor, but the vast majority of fossils are less than one inch in size, and removing accumulated soil will reveal them.

, You are likely to make many interesting discoveries while you search. Petrified wood is common in many areas, and arrow heads and other Indian artifacts, unique crystals, agates, and semiprecious gemstones can be a reward for your efforts.

, Look in the gravel piles at landscaping supply stores and gravel parking lots where large, coarse stones are used.

It’s important to know what you want out of collecting before you begin to collect. For most people, this will simply be a choice between collecting for fun or attempting to collect as a source of investment.If you’re choosing to collect as an investment, know ahead of time how much time and money you’re willing to spend. Those will be the factors which most influence your collecting.
If you’re collecting out of interest, then collecting will be a matter of choosing what you like best. You might consider centering your starting collection around a certain theme, like color or location of origin.;
, While the idea of finding gemstones in the wild may summon images of mine shafts and cave formations, there are actually a number of ways and places where anyone can look for gemstones. Unless you’re lucky most locations with public digs will require a bit of a trip, so plan ahead if you’re hoping to visit a dig site.Those who are collecting as an investment will want to stay away from public digs. Gemstones worth investing in will need to be considerably more rare than those found at public dig sites.
Also, those who are looking to collect especially exotic or scarce gemstones may want to look elsewhere. Public digs will usually only involve more common gemstones, such as emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds.To find dig sites, look online. Alternatively, you can seek out local geological/gemological societies and organizations for any recommendations.
Prepare for anything when it comes to these public digs. Some are sheltered and have you sitting and sifting, others have you entering caves with full equipment.

, Certainly a perk for the gem enthusiast, collecting gems will require you to possess or begin to possess a familiarity with gemstones. Even the shrewd investment collector will prefer to be able to at least somewhat identify gemstones they see in person.Identifying gemstones will require some equipment: tweezers, a loupe (glass eye, usually with 10x magnification), and some light source.
More advanced identifying techniques may require a refractometer or polariscope. This is why it is always a good idea to form a good relationship with a dealer; a friendly dealer may lend their expertise and equipment when you’ve got something that needs identifying.
Fortunately the most basic assessments can be done with the naked eye by examining the gem’s color by analyzing its hue (base color), tone (depth of color), and saturation (strength of color).
The exhaustive specifics for identifying gemstones are too numerous to list here, but you can visit http://www.jtv.com/library/how-to-identify-gemstones.html for comprehensive information.

, Though only a serious concern for investment collectors, it’s never a poor choice to decide what you’d like to purchase ahead of time. Of course what you choose to buy will ultimately be decided by how much you’re willing to spend; this is something that, mentioned previously, is also helpful to know ahead of time.Collectibility (and value) in gemstones is almost always decided by rarity. While rarity may not always mean expensive to purchase, rarity will mean consistency of value--gems which are rare now will only become more rare.
In that vein, gemstones you’ll want to look for if you’re an investor are those which are especially rare in occurrence, or more common gems with uncommon traits (such as “unheated” gems or unusual colors like yellow sapphire).
Again, don’t purchase the most expensive gems you can find in the hopes of them being more expensive later on. The gem market is unusually receptive to short-lived trends, and certain gems may receive artificial price boosts which fail to last.

, As one might imagine, a growing number of gem dealers are expanding or altogether moving their operations online. The most important thing to be aware of when shopping online (for gems or anything else) is to be aware of anything that looks illegitimate or untrustworthy.


Normally you’ll want sites that have a good selection, as well as a photograph along with everything they sell. Never buy from a site which doesn’t allow returns; too often you’ll find gems in-person won’t match their online photographs.
While there are a host of legitimate sites online, a few reputable choices with broad selections are: http://www.multicolour.com/, http://www.palagems.com/, and http://www.thechinastone.com/.
It’s not a bad idea to choose a few sites to build a lasting relationship with; it often becomes easier to do business with dealers that know you better.

, While gems are going the way of so many other commodities and transitioning into online sales, there are still plenty of places to find gems for sale. If you’re fortunate you may have a gem collector’s shop in your own town. While these rarely contain a large selection for sale, they are a good base for trade talk and advice.The most reliable and active scene for purchasing gems in person will be trade fairs. Usually traveling or part of temporary flea markets, these are usually groups of several vendors looking to sell.
Be aware that there’s often a culture of haggling at these gatherings; be prepared to have to talk some prices down.
Like online stores, it helps to build relationships with any dealers you find reliable, especially if you’re looking for certain gems in particular. A good dealer can provide insight into the smaller gem mining/processing community.

, Those collectors who are out for sheer interest need not hunt down the most refined and reputable dealers for their gemstones. Far from suggesting anything illegitimate, hobby collectors should consider other avenues, such as informal online trading, for their gem purchases.


Since hobby collectors generally have specific stones in mind which might not fall in the rare or expensive category, casting a wider net can be very helpful.
If you have a specific gemstone in mind, don’t hesitate to try and reach out to others on Craigslist or gemstone collecting forums online. Plenty of communities will already have an ad-hoc trading environment set up.
Trade fairs will also have a fair amount for hobby collectors to appreciate. It’s also a good idea for hobby dealers to build relationships with certain dealers, many of whom are willing to keep their eyes out for specimens you have in mind.

, Part of ensuring the integrity of your collection, whether you’re seriously invested or not, will be to have some assurance that the gemstones you own are, in fact, the gemstones you believe them to be. Fortunately there exist organizations which provide these sort of reports, and established dealers will already be well-acquainted with them.The most common and definitive is the American Gemological Laboratory (AGL) Colored Stone Grading Report. Be sure to get one of these with every colored stone purchase, especially those whose location is of importance (such as Kashmir sapphires).
Diamonds have their own report from the Gemological Institute of America; it is highly recommended to have one with every diamond purchase as their reports are unique and undisputed.

, Like many other collectibles, gemstones have formed multiple organizations surrounding the collection and maintenance of gemstones. The two biggest names in this regard are the International Gem Society and the American Gem Society.Membership in either grants you access to their collective knowledge in the form of articles, courses, and meetings.
Usually memberships will also grant you certain preference with affiliated dealers as well as access to certain gem labs for identification., For those collectors who are also serious investors, obtaining insurance to cover your gemstone collection is a must. Some might think that homeowner’s or renter’s insurance will adequately cover their collection. Unfortunately this protection is usually very limited, and often excludes jewelry. If it doesn’t, it might demand the use of certain replacement firms.Be sure you know what you want out of your insurance before purchasing--how much risk do you need covered? Will you want third-party damage (in the care of a dealer, for example) covered?
Inquire whether or not any policy you’ll be purchasing covers “mysterious disappearances.” If your gems are missing and you’ve no evidence of a robbery, you might not be covered if only insured against theft.
See if there are any discounts to be had for safe-keeping of the gemstones, or for guarantees that certain gems never leave your home.
Always shop around. Any policy that doesn’t seem to be a good fit is worth walking away from. Keep looking for a policy that will fit your life and budget.

, Even for the most casual collector, gemstone collections can quickly grow in value. It’s important to have a place that’s especially secure in which to store your collection. While it’s tempting to always have the most impressive gems on display, consider doing so only when you know they’ll be seen and store them the rest of the time.


For the home, there’s usually no safer choice than a safe itself. General wisdom concerning safes recommends you keep them in an obscure area like a closet, and keep them bolted to the floor.
Those collectors who have invested in very expensive pieces may want to consider a safety deposit box for added security.
Unless specific pieces are especially large, everyone (from the most serious investor to someone just beginning) will keep their gems in small, circular foam inserts set inside “gem jars” which are shallow plastic cases.

These are always available online, usually in groups of 20 to 50+.
If you’d like to label your gems, it’s best to do so on the outside of any one gem jar, as opposed to appending anything to the gem itself.



, While we may associate gemstones with a sort of sterile beauty, the truth is that they’ve been handled repeatedly in their journey from stone to you. In that process the gemstone will have built up with oil and grime which may not be visible with the naked eye. If left dirty, gems can wear over time and lose definition and luster. Be sure to avoid this by properly cleaning any gems before storing them.Different gemstones will require different methods of cleaning, visit https://www.gemsociety.org/article/care-maintenance-gemstones/ for a comprehensive list of gemstones and the proper ways to clean them.
While they will differ, the vast majority of cleaning methods will involve a soft cloth and non-abrasive detergent or soap.

, Once you’ve continued with your collection for some time, you may find yourself struggling to keep track of everything you have. For the serious investor, a catalog is a must-have for financial and legal records. Keeping a thorough catalog is a good habit to begin early so that it’s never too much of a burden to create one.Electronic catalogs made with programs like Microsoft Excel will be the best for this. A single physical catalog is subject to damage or loss; keeping it electronic will assure availability.

Try the Waller solution.,
Get oxalic acid.,
Put your quartz in the oxalic acid.,
Dispose of the oxalic acid very carefully.",How to Clean Quartz2," Before trying harsh chemicals on your quartz, try the Waller solution method first because the chemicals in the solution are easier to obtain and are less harmful. You can buy the chemicals and mix them yourself or purchase Super Iron Out at a regular department store (such as Walmart).Put the quartz in the solution outside because the solution has a strong smell.
The solution only lasts for 24 hours.
Make the solution at home with: 8.4 grams of Sodium Bicarbonate, 17.4 grams of Sodium Dithionite, and 5.9 grams of Trisodium salt of Citric Acid (sodium citrate).
Make sure to wear eye goggles and gloves when using the Waller solution., If the Waller solution does not work, you can use oxalic acid to clean quartz. You should be very careful with it because it is toxic. Make sure to wear gloves, protective eye gear, and to not inhale the oxalic acid. Make sure to use the oxalic acid outside where there is ventilation. There are other chemicals you can use instead of oxalic acid to clean quartz, but they are more dangerous.


You can usually find oxalic acid for sale in hardware stores.
Use technical or industrial grade oxalic acid because it is less expensive than pure oxalic acid., Mix 1-1.5 pounds of oxalic acid with around five gallons of water. Mix the oxalic acid in a plastic or ceramic container because it attacks metals. Let your quartz soak in the oxalic acid solution overnight. After the the quartz is clean, rinse the quartz in clean water for a few hours.


Be extremely careful with oxalic acid.
Always where gloves and protective eye gear.
Work with the oxalic acid somewhere well ventilated., Do not throw oxalic acid down the drain. Neutralize your quartz with limestone chips. You can leave this neutralized solution around (somewhere safe) and add more oxalic acid to it later if you need it again. You can also let the solution evaporate."

Protect your travertine countertops.,
Clean up spills immediately.,
Clean regularly with gentle products.",How to Clean Travertine2," Acidic liquids, hot pans, and wet glasses can damage your travertine countertops. The best way to combat damage is to prevent it. Use hot pads, placemats, and coasters on your kitchen countertops. In your bathroom, place all of your beauty and health products on a vanity tray instead of directly on the counter., Travertine is a porous stone that absorbs liquids. When accidents happen, blot up the spill right away. Wiping up the spill will only cause the item to spread, increasing the area susceptible to a permanent stain.


Once a year, seal your countertops. This layer of protection will prevent stains from setting., Sanitize and wipe down your travertine countertops on a regular basis with hot water, gentle cleaners, and a microfiber rag.


Spray the surface with a gentle cleaner that is safe on natural stone.
Wipe up the cleaner with a fresh microfiber rag.
Polish the surface with a new microfiber cloth."
"
Squeegee and wipe down your shower after every use.,
Clean your shower every one to two weeks.,
Deep clean and assess the integrity of your travertine twice a year.",How to Clean Travertine3," Following a shower, your shower’s walls are covered in water, soap, and dirt particles. When left on the walls, soap scum is formed and mildew and molds grow. To prevent the build up of these items, squeegee your shower walls and door after each use. Run over the walls and corners with a clean, dry towel to soak up any remaining water. Leave the shower door ajar to allow the area to dry.Maintaining this daily routine will make it easier to clean your travertine shower.
To eliminate soap scum, switch from bar soap to liquid soap., While wiping down your shower walls after each use will dramatically decrease the presence of soap scum, mildew, and mold, trace amounts of these items will cover your shower walls. Clean your shower every one to two weeks.


Spray the walls and shower door with a gentle cleaner.
Allow the product to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
Buff the travertine stone, glass, and metal fixtures with a clean microfiber cloth.
Eradicate mineral build-up with a stone scrub, an abrasive cleaner that should be used with caution on polished surfaces. Spray the treated area with a gentle cleaner and blot with a microfiber cloth. , Constant exposure to water can damage travertine tiles, ruin grout, and encourage the production of soap scum, mildew, and mold. To maintain a clean, structurally sound shower, conduct a deep clean and an assessment every six months.


Treat your walls with a soap film remover to remove soap scum build up. Allow the product to sit for a few minutes before polishing it off with a microfiber rag.
Target mildew and mold in your shower with a mild mildew remover. After allowing product to sit for a few minutes, remove the residue with a clean microfiber rag.
Examine your grout and search for cracks and holes. If you discover any missing grout, repair it immediately—cracks and holes in the grout may lead to extensive water damage. Allow the repaired grout to cure for 7 to 10 days.
Observe the tiles for discoloration. If you spot a dark tile that was once light, this is a sign of water absorption. Apply a sealer to your shower."

Wash the geode with laundry detergent and water.,
Soak the geode in bleach for a day.,
Clean the geode with a toothbrush and denture cleaner.,
Get into any crevices.",How to Clean Geodes1," You don't use harsh chemicals to clean a geode. Stick to a simple mixture of water and laundry detergent. Mix a splash of laundry detergent with warm water and gently swab the geode with a toothbrush. As the geode will need to soak to get completely clean, you will not be able to get off all the dirt and debris in the first round of cleaning. Simply strive to do your best., Mix a tub of water with a quarter cup of any household bleach. You can buy bleach at a department or hardware store. Submerge the geode in the bleach and let it soak for 24 hours.Make sure to wear gloves when handling bleach.

, After the geode has soaked, you can wash off the remaining dirt and debris. You can buy denture cleaner at most department stores. Use denture cleaner and a soft-bristle toothbrush to scrub off any remaining dirt stuck to the geode.Dirt that did not come off during the first round of cleaning will come off more easily after the geode has been soaked.

, Geodes have a lot of cracks and crevices. When cleaning the geode, make sure to get into these cracks to remove any dirt. Strive to be very thorough and inspect any crevices closely for lingering debris."

Handle rare coins carefully.,
Soak the coins in warm distilled water and soap.,
Replace the water daily.,
Dry carefully.,
Wet and freeze the coins.,
Remove heavy dirt buildup with long-term oil soaks.,
Check on the oil every couple weeks.,
Use an ultrasonic cleaning machine.",How to Clean Silver Coins1," Handle rare or unidentified silver coins as little as possible. Hold them by the edge only, not the face, and ideally wear lint-free cotton gloves. Even if the coin looks dirty or damaged to you, a collector may pay more if you leave it in its natural state and avoid further damage.Store rare coins in Mylar plastic coin flips, or ask a coin dealer for alternatives. PVC coin flips can damage your coins.;
, Add a few drops of mild soap (not detergent) to a glass of warm distilled water.Put the coins in gently and leave them to soak, turning them over every few hours. This is the only guaranteed safe way to clean silver-plated coins (though pure silver is a little hardier).Tap water contains chlorine that can lead to discoloration.Tarnish (a thin layer of grey, black, or iridescence also called ""toning"") is not the same as dirt.If the coin is rare, toning may even be a desirable feature that raises the coin's value., The next day, if the coins are still grimy, replace the water with fresh distilled water and soap. Repeat daily until the coins are clean (but still have their toning)., Pat the coins dry with a paper towel, or leave them on an absorbent cloth to air dry. Rubbing the coins is very risky, since it can scratch through the toning.Careful brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush is usually safe, but work slowly and gently with valuable coins.The goal is to dislodge loose dirt, not to brush the coin's surface directly.

, If the coins are still dirty, soak them in distilled water again. Transfer the wet coins to a plastic container in the freezer. The water will expand as it freezes, hopefully breaking off some of the dirt from underneath. Gently pat or brush off dirt once frozen. In most cases, you will need to repeat the soaking and freezing several times., If the coins are covered in mud or dirt and do not respond to the methods above, soak them in mineral oil or olive oil. Mineral oil should never harm your coin, but must be washed off with acetone afterward. Olive oil will also work, but there is a slight chance of damage.Either one can take months to clean extra-dirty coins. For best results, prop the coins up on a piece of plastic so both sides are exposed to the oil.


Cheap, non-virgin olive oil works better than virgin or extra-virgin, since it is more acidic.If the coins are not valuable as collector's items, you can skip to the harsh cleaning methods instead to save time. If the coins are rare or unidentified and you don't want to wait months, take them to a coin collector for advice.

, Rinse the coins in warm, soapy water to remove the oil. If the dirt doesn't come off with it, leave the coins to soak longer. If using olive oil, replace it whenever it turns dark green.Once the coins are clean, rinse them in warm, soapy water. If you used mineral oil, wipe them with a swab dipped in pure acetone.

, These machines vibrate the coin rapidly to dislodge dirt. Small machines for home use are safe for coin cleaning, but will only remove soft, minor dirt buildup. Large, professional machines are more effective, but must be used carefully. For best results, suspend a cup from a string so it sits halfway submerged in the machine's bath, without touching the base. Fill the cup with slightly soapy distilled water and hang the coin suspended in this solution. Fill the main bath with pure distilled water, run the machine for only a few minutes, brush the coin, and repeat.You can run the machine without the cup, but dirt or objects on the base of the pan will interfere with the pan's vibration and shorten the machine's lifespan.

Place a kitchen towel on a flat surface.,
Move heavier pieces of amethyst in a towel.,
Prepare a sink or bowl with soapy water.,
Soak or wipe down your amethyst before scrubbing.,
Brush off any remaining gunk and rinse your amethyst.,
Rinse your amethyst.,
Allow amethyst to air dry.,
Clean jewelry once a week.,
Avoid using too much heat.,
Opt for natural light when drying your amethyst.,
Store amethyst in an area with a consistent temperature.",How to Clean Amethyst," To start, set a flat towel down on a flat surface such as a counter. You should place your amethyst here to dry it and also to scrub it after soaking it in the water., Small pieces amethyst can be moved easily by hand. However, if you're washing large pieces of amethyst, wrap them in an old towel and use this as a dolly to transport amethyst from place to place.If your pieces of amethyst are very large, it may be easier to wash them outside with a hose. You may not be able to soak large pieces of amethyst.

, Choose a sink or bowl big enough to submerge your amethyst. Fill it with water to begin the washing process.Opt for warm water over hot or cold water. Extreme temperatures can cause amethyst to crack.
Use a mild dish detergent to clean your amethyst.

, Small pieces of amethyst can be submerged in soapy water for 15 to 20 minutes. This helps loosen up the dirt, making it easier to scrub off dirt and grime. If your geode is too big to submerge, soak a washcloth in warm water and add a small amount of dish detergent to it. Work up a lather and wipe down the sides of your amethyst with the cloth.If your cloth gets dirty while scrubbing, rinse it off and add more soap.
You are only trying to loosen up the dirt at this point, so don't worry too much if you're not getting everything off the amethyst. Just make sure to get the amethyst as wet as possible before moving on to the scrubbing process.

, Amethyst should be rubbed down with a toothbrush after soaking. Use the toothbrush to remove any grease or grime stuck to the amethyst. Work the toothbrush into any unusual cracks and crevices in the amethyst, making sure to scrub harder on dirtier areas.Rinse the amethyst in a bowl of clear water as you brush it off. This helps remove any dirt or grime you dislodged.
For a piece of amethyst that's very dirty, this process can take as long as 30 minutes. Have patience and get in a comfortable position as you scrub your amethyst.
Amethyst jewelery may not require as vigorous scrubbing, as it is likely not as prone to built up dirt. Something like a geode will require more time commitment, while a piece of jewelery may only need a quick wipe down.

, Once the amethyst has been soaked or scrubbed, rinse it off completely. Stick to using warm water for the rinsing process. Remember, hot or cold water can damage amethyst.Smaller pieces of amethyst can be soaked in clear water or under the sink. Make sure to rinse the amethyst until water runs clear. Left on soap can cause damage to your amethyst.
Large pieces of amethyst may have to be rinsed with a hose. Make sure to use warm water and do not turn the hose on a high pressure setting. Spray down the amethyst until the water from the hose runs clear.

, You should never attempt to dry an amethyst manually, especially not with heat. After washing your amethyst, set it aside. Allow it to air dry completely before using it again., If you wear amethyst as jewelry, it will require more frequent cleaning. This helps protect you from exposure to germs. Amethyst worn as jewelry can be cleaned once a week., Amethyst is very sensitive to heat and extreme temperatures in general. Hot water should never be used on amethyst. You should also never dry amethyst with heat treatments, like a hair dryer. Be patient and allow amethyst to dry on its own., Amethyst dries best in natural light. If possible, place amethyst in natural light to dry. You can dry it on your porch or near the window., Amethyst is sensitive to changes in temperature. After washing amethyst, find an area with a consistent temperature to store it."

Look at a variety of stones.,
Check for consistency.,
Decide on a shade.",How to Buy a Peridot1," Expect peridot to come in various shades of green. Visit a respectable jeweler to browse a number of samples, all at once. Familiarize yourself with the different shades that it comes in, from olive to rich green to slightly yellowed.The iron content in each gem determines its color. The deeper the green, the more iron is present.;
, Although peridot comes in a variety of shades, make sure the shade of each gem is consistent throughout its body. Inspect all sides of loose stones to see if they match each other in color. With jewelry, check all exposed sides.If possible, view it under different sources and levels of light, as well. Expect the gem’s color to remain consistent regardless of changes in lighting.

, This is a matter of taste, of course, so go with your gut. However, bear a few things in mind. Expect many people to consider green gems free of any other tints to be the finest specimens.At the same time, be aware that imitations are usually free of these tints as well.Imitations include apatite, green garnets, green sinhalite, green tourmaline, green zircon, and moldavites.
If authenticity is an issue, go with a gem with a yellowish tint, since this never occurs in imitations.

Rinse your geodes.,
Put on protective gloves and googles.,
Mix a cleaning solution.,
Soak the geode in wood bleach for a few hours.,
Keep soaking the geode until it's clean.,
Wash the geode with warm water.",How to Clean Geodes2," If iron residue is stuck on your geode, you will need to soak it in wood bleach to clean it. To start, give your geode a light rinsing under the faucet to remove any dirt or debris., Wood bleach can be very harmful to the hands and eyes. Safety precautions are important if your'e working with wood bleach, so throw on a pair of gloves and goggles before handling the bleach., Typically, to soak a geode, you should mix an eighth cup of wood bleach in five liters of water. However, make sure to read the label on the bleach you purchased. Some bleaches may need to be diluted more than others., Submerge your geode completely in the wood bleach mixture. Allow it to soak for around two to three hour before checking on it. If the iron is gone, you can remove the geode at this point., If there is still iron on the geode, check it again in about half an hour. Be vigilant about checking the geode frequently until the iron is removed. Letting the geode linger in wood bleach for too long can harm the geode., After the iron is removed, take the geode out of the bleach solution. Wash off the bleach by running the geode under warm water.Make sure to wear gloves when removing the geode from the bleach.

Sand your geodes.,
Put on protective goggles.,
Polish your rocks.",How to Clean Geodes3," Use coarse sandpaper moistened slightly with water. Rub this over the geode to sand out any rough patches. Keep sanding the geode until it's as smooth as you want.Be gentle at first and increase pressure as you sand. Some geodes are softer than others, and you want to avoid damage as much as possible.

, Small bits of stone may fly off your geode while you polish it. Before you start polishing, put on a pair of protective goggles to keep yourself safe., Use a heavier fabric like denim to add a commercial finishing polish to your geode. Rub down the geode gently until it's as shiny as you want.You can buy commercial finishing polish for gems online or at some hardware stores.

Use extreme caution with valuable coins.,
Pick dirt out of small crevices.,
Rub with silver polish.,
Wipe with a paste of baking soda and water.,
Remove hard deposits with ammonium.,
Use extra-harsh treatments as a last resort.",How to Clean Silver Coins2," Cleaning a rare, collectible coin can reduce its value by over 50% due to tiny scratches or the removal of the tarnish. If the gentle cleaning methods above do not work, it's safer to have it cleaned professionally or accept an imperfect appearance. Feel free to use the methods below on common, non-collectible coins if you prefer a brighter appearance for your own collection.


An even gold, grey, or iridescent tarnish (toning) is desirable and increases the coin's value.A black or blotchy tarnish is not ideal, but harsh cleaning can still lower the value. Continue very carefully or take it to a professional.

, After washing the coin in soapy water, you may still see dark areas outlining letters or detailed images. Wash again and pick away this dirt slowly and carefully using a toothpick or bamboo skewer. Take care not to scratch the coin, since the pick can scratch away the tarnish.Pointy plastic utensils are slower, but less likely to scratch the coin.

, Silver polishes clean metal using acid and abrasives, both of which eat away a small layer of metal. This is an easy way to brighten non-collectible coins, but will almost certainly damage the value of collectibles:Put a coin-sized dollop of polish on a soft cloth.
Fold the cloth in half to transfer the polish to two sides.
Place the coin between the fold of cloth.
Rub together briefly.
Wipe off the coin on a clean part of the cloth.

, This cheaper alternative to silver polish also abrades the silver coin, causing scratches that will be visible under a magnifying glass. Minimize damage by using distilled water and mixing in just a little baking soda to make a watery paste. Dip the entire coin the paste, rub between your fingers for a minute, then rinse with water. Repeat two or three times if necessary. Pat dry., A thick buildup on ancient coins is likely ""horn silver"" (silver chloride). This may be worth removing, especially if it prevents identification. Submerge the coin in a 10% ammonia solution in a tightly sealed container. Remove it after a few minutes, rinse immediately in water, then brush with a soft toothbrush. Repeat as needed.Warning: ammonia liquid and fumes are corrosive. Wear neoprene gloves and work in a ventilated area.Some hard buildups are the result of a different chemical reaction, which may require other treatments. Consult a coin dealer first if the coin might be valuable.

, The following treatments are especially risky. Without expert supervision, they may remove the tarnish or pit the coin's surface. These are more often used on ancient coins, where heavy buildup may prevent identification or severely lower the value. Relatively modern, machine-made coins should only be treated this way if they have little collector's value and an unattractive tarnish:


Soak the coin in a 50/50 mix of distilled water and lemon juice for one hour.Soak the coin in 1 tsp (5 mL) lemon juice mixed into 1.5 cups (360 mL) olive oil. Warm this in a heat safe container inside a water bath, but keep it below boiling.""Dipping"" treatments can return a coin to a frosty white silver appearance, which some collectors value. However, this is an extremely risky procedure that can cause blemishes to appear. Hiring a professional is strongly recommended, but you can buy a dipping solution to use at home."
"
Check how clear the gem is.,
Look for expert cuts.,
Decide on a carat.",How to Buy a Peridot2," Hold the peridot up to a light source. Note how clear the body of the gem appears as light passes through it. Discard any that appear cloudy.Quality gems may have very small lines or marks running through them, but this is common.
Although there are gems out there that are completely free of any blemishes, these are very rare.

, Expect peridot to come in a variety of shapes, from round to oval to square and beyond. Whatever shape it has been cut in, inspect the surface for imperfections in its symmetry or design. Discard any that appear to be cut irregularly.Peridot is not a rare stone, so a poorly cut one has far less value than another with more precise cuts.
One exception might be a gem that is totally transparent under a microscope, without any of fine lines that run through most specimens. Such stones are very rare.
Alternately, if you can afford it, you could purchase a large, roughly shaped stone and hire a jeweler to recut it more precisely., Check the gem’s weight, or “carat.” Expect most to range from 0.5 to 4 CTW (carat total weight). Expect the price to rise along with its weight, so for a stone with a higher value, go with a higher carat.Remember, though, that peridot is a very common stone. Because of this, more emphasis is placed on a perfect cut.
Therefore, a misshapen peridot with 1.0 CTW isn’t necessarily worth more than a perfectly symmetrical one at 0.5 CTW.

"
Only deal with trusted sellers.,
Ask about how the gem has been treated.,
Be discriminating with private owners.",How to Buy a Peridot3," Although no man-made imitations exist, be aware that other naturally occurring materials are sometimes passed off as peridots. Always look into who you’re buying from before making a final purchase. Research their history by:Checking customer reviews and ratings.
Joining online forums and asking about sellers to avoid.
Favoring those with warranties, return policies, certification of products, and other forms of buyer protection.

, Check to see if the seller includes this in their product description, whether it’s in-store or online. If not, ask them directly how they have treated the stone while it’s been in their possession. Know that:Peridot should only be cleaned a couple of times a year at most.
It should only been cleaned with mild soap and water and a brush with soft bristles.
Unlike other stones, it should never be cleaned with ultrasonic cleaners.

, If you are looking to buy a specific piece from a private owner, rather than a seller, be extra diligent about judging how they treat their jewelry. Ask if they have any certification from the seller they bought it from originally. Also keep in mind that peridots are soft stones, which means they can be damaged easily. Make sure the owner:Keeps their jewelry in a temperature-controlled environment, since fluctuations in temperature and prolonged heat can cause the stone’s color to fade over time.
Stores their peridot in a soft padding, such a pouch or a box lined with cotton or velvet, to protect it from scratches.
Cleans their peridot appropriately, with soft soap and brushes, no more than once or twice a year.

Ensure that your coins are kept at the right temperature.,
Invest in coin holders and in coin folders.,
Store your coins in rolls.,
Pile your coins in plastic, transparent tubes.,
Consider slabbing valuable coins.",How to Display Coins," Coins must be stored in a dry and cool space. Changes in temperature, humidity and moisture can tarnish the coins and encourage spots. Coins should not be stored in a basement or attic, in which the environment can fluctuate frequently.;
, These come in different shapes and sizes for specific coins. These holders provide good protection while still enabling you to look at them.

, These are available from the bank for free and coins can easily be slipped into them. Rolls keep the coins in one place untouched.

, These tubes can be found at a craft store. They are best for rolls of coins and also can be seen through the plastic. With an attached lid, the tubes will provide great protection and prevent anything from touching them.

, A ""slab"" is a sealed, hard plastic covering for individual coins. Slabbing coins is expensive, but it is good protection and is able to be accessed easily.

Fill a small bowl or container.,
Scrub away the grime.,
Add it back to the water.,
Dry your ruby thoroughly.",How to Clean Rubies1," Add a couple of drops of gentle liquid soap with warm, not hot, water and let the stone soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Be mindful if you’re cleaning multiple stones or pieces at once as to not overcrowd your cleaning dish., Using a soft bristle brush or cloth, gently rub the stone to loosen up any debris or dirt from the stone and setting. Don’t scrub too hard and avoid getting too deep between crevices so the ruby doesn’t become unsecure.

, Take a good look at the stone to see how much more cleaning it needs. If it looks shiny and clean, swish it around in the water solution one last time to get rid of any lingering dirt. If it’s still a bit dirty, refill your bowl with clean water and solution and let it soak one more time before scrubbing again.

, Wipe the stone clean with a dry, lint-free cloth. Place it on a rag or cloth to let fully dry before wearing or storing.

Don't clean your coins if you plan to sell them, or if they have any potential value.,
Handle coins with care.,
Do not clean mostly-copper coins (like pennies) with non-copper coins.",How to Clean Rusty Coins1," Cleaning will decrease their value significantly. Avoid cleaning corrosion (such as rust), buildup (such as dirt), and other filth from old coins if you are hoping to sell them for prices anywhere near coin-collecting book values. If the coins you want to clean are part of a numismatic (serious study of coins) collection, do not clean them. Doing so can greatly diminish their coin-collecting values. Leave the cleaning of valuable coinage to experts, who are in the business of this work.;
, Any potentially valuable coins should not even be handled with your bare hands. Don gloves, and put the coins in plastic coin envelopes. Get your coins appraised by a professional before you proceed. The same goes for all antiques: don't clean, paint or polish anything that may have value before getting them appraised.

, Copper can discolor other coin surfaces when they are left to soak together in a cleaning solution. In terms of American currency: clean pennies separately from nickles, dimes, quarters, etc.


Do not leave copper pennies to soak with steel pennies. The copper could react with the cleaning chemicals and somewhat dissolve in the solution. The dissolved copper will bind to the steel pennies, ruining their finishes.

Purchase an ultrasonic cleaner.,
Check your ruby before cleaning it.,
Make your solution.,
Mix up the solution.,
Add your rubies to the cleaner.,
Run the device.,
Let your jewelry sit in the cleaner.,
Gently scrub your ruby.",How to Clean Rubies2," Ultrasonic jewelry cleaners can range in price from less than $50 to more than $200. While there are no specific cleaners for rubies, consider the size, hassle and features when purchasing a model.Some tanks are spacious enough to clean sunglasses or watches and can hold numerous items at once.
Cleaners with timers offer a stress-free cleaning experience. You choose the time, set the device, and can walk away.
High-end devices can include steamers, which offer an additional level of cleaning. This option is good if you have many precious items and plan to clean them regularly to keep their shine. It can, however, run about $200.
Check to see if the ultrasonic cleaner requires solution, as some do not.
Some cleaners run at the same frequency (42,000 Hz is standard) while others offer different settings to accommodate different types of material.

, Unless your ruby stone is fracture-filled or coated to enhance its hue, it should be safe to use in an ultrasonic cleaner.


Ask your jeweler to ensure it is untreated, heat-treated or lattice diffusion treated.
Rubies and sapphires are strong enough for an ultrasonic cleaner.
Opaque gemstones, opals and organic gems like pearls and ambers are too delicate.
Metals like gold and platinum are safe to clean in ultrasonic devices., Add hot water and a couple drops of dishwashing liquid to the ultrasonic cleaner tank. You can also purchase a nontoxic gem-cleaning solution instead of making your own for about $5 to $10. Any standard jewelry cleaner works, but check the label to be sure there are no exceptions.

, Once the solution is in the device, let it run for 5 to 10 minutes to mix the solution entirely before using.

, Be sure to only add a few pieces at once into the cleaner in order to avoid scratches during the process.

, Depending on the dirtiness of the ruby, you’ll run the cleaner up to 20 minutes. If it’s your first time cleaning your stone, start with a shorter time frame and add on if it’s still dirty.

, After the ultrasonic cleaner runs, let your rubies sit in there for 5 to 10 minutes before removing. This will help to ensure that the loosened dirt and grime falls to the bottom of the device.

, There might be some dirt and grime still stuck to your ruby, so grab a soft bristle brush to remove anything lingering. Carefully scrub the stone. Once it’s fully cleaned, dry your ruby with a lint-free cloth. "

Protect your ruby.,
Take your ruby jewelry off.,
Check your stone for damage regularly.,
Store rubies properly.,
Take your ruby to the jeweler.",How to Clean Rubies3," Avoid wearing ruby rings or jewelry while using harsh chemicals like cleaning supplies or hair spray. To maintain the shine, keep the ruby away from makeup debris, dirt, dust and other grime that can easily get caught in the setting.

, Before doing any high-impact or intensive work like going to the gym, working with tools and moving around heavy furniture, leave your ruby in a safe place to protect against knocking or rubbing the stone. , Even when you’re careful, it’s possible to cause damage to a ruby stone. Make a habit out of checking your jewelry, especially if it’s worn regularly, to ensure you can quickly detect nicks, scratches and loose parts of the setting.

, Always keep rubies away from other jewelry to avoid possible scratches and nicks. When you’re storing your jewelry, wrap it in a cloth or keep it in its own pouch or section of your jewelry box., Sometimes it’s just best to visit a professional. If you notice your ring is especially dirty, has any loose parts or has any major damage, a jeweler will be able to detect any serious problems or risks.

Use a metal-polishing soap.,
Look for metal cleaners at an auto-parts store.,
Try using ultrasonic jewelry cleaners.",How to Clean Rusty Coins2," To remove rust and similar corrosion from most coins, try S100 Polishing Soap. You may be surprised at how well this removes rust from coin surfaces. It is also well suited to silver coins, and it is used by German silversmiths to clean silver jewelry. Silver cleaning wadding or batting products are sometimes helpful since these wool or cotton fibers help clean uneven surfaces on coins. Weiman metal polish should do the trick, along with many other brands.

, Try the automobile section of your local department store to find a variety of metal polishes and cleaners that can also be used to clean metal coins. You can use silver cleaner, copper cleaner, or other metal cleaner – but the results of any product will be most effective if you're using it on the type of metal for which it is advertised.

, Again, only if these coins aren't being cleaned for the purposes of coin collecting – such as in a collection of coins with any emphasis on building monetary value. Be sure to follow all of the manufacturer's instructions and recommendations whenever using ultrasonic cleaning devices.

Wash the coin under cold running water.,
Run the water over the coin for about a minute.,
Lightly brush the coin.,
Spot-clean encrusted dirt.,
Pour some vinegar over the coin.,
Rinse the coin again.,
Dry the coin.",How to Clean Rusty Coins3," Hold the coin by its edges: touching the surface directly can leave small scratches in the surface. If you want to protect the coin’s surface, don't rub it.

, The higher your water pressure, the better. Make sure to not use a high-powered water jet that could go straight through the coin.

, If dirt remains, lightly scrub the coin with a soft toothbrush and dish soap. Run the toothbrush under warm water to further soften the bristles. Rinse the brush and the coin frequently to avoid scratching the coin with the loosened dirt. Do not apply much pressure, and focus on brushing only the soiled area of the coin.


Toothbrush bristles come with varying degrees of firmness — you want one labeled as soft or extra-soft. If you use a firm bristle, you risk damaging the coin.

, Especially on ancient coins, there may be dirt that remains after soaking and brushing. To remove this, use a small, sharp implement such as a toothpick or a precision screwdriver. Carefully pry and chip off the encrusted dirt, and try not to scratch the surface of the coin. You can spot-clean more precisely if you work under good lighting and use a microscope or magnifying glass.

, Wait about ten minutes, then rub the vinegar off with a toothbrush. This may give the coin a more polished finish. Consider using anything acidic: lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, and even sodas have been said to help clean rust off of old coins.


Consider adding salt to your vinegar/citric acid/soda. The combination of acid and chloride may make your cleaning solution even more powerful.

, After soaking, thoroughly rinse the coin under very warm, running water. If the coin is clean enough for your taste, proceed to drying. Don't leave the acid on the coin, or it will keep etching and produce an unsightly green coating of copper salts.

, Pat the coin dry with a soft, lint-free cloth, and then lay the coin on a soft, dry cloth to finish drying. Do not rub the coin dry.

, Yes, smush. Smush the pennies down into the ketchup, and let them soak in. Jiggle them around a little if necessary.

, Use a Q-tip to swab up some ketchup from the side of the plate and spread it on the top of your pennies. Again smush, and continue to spread and smooth.

, Use 2 Q-tips to flip each penny over, and spread more over the tops again. Let the pennies soak. Smush, spread, let soak. Smush, spread, let soak.

, No, you don't have to reach in the goopy red mess with your bare hands and dig the pennies out. Use a spoon to scoop them out.

, By this time, your pennies are going to look even uglier than they did before, with all the ketchup on them. Put them in a bowl and run them under the sink (water temperature doesn't matter). Then pour it out, being careful to hold your hand over the bowl so the money stays inside. Then run water over the pennies once more to ensure cleanliness.

""Buy the book before the coin"".,
Join a coin club or numismatic association.",How to Collect Coins," If you are buying coins, you can expect such coins to be in respectable condition, even if it is over 500 years old. Of course, as the age of the coin increases, the condition, if very good, will add more value.;
, This does not mean that you have to buy fancy coin holders (although this would keep them in better condition). Coin holders can be fairly cheap or you can use an old shoe box or peanut butter jar.

, If you are buying expensive coins, invest in a safe-deposit box and containers that will not destroy the numismatic value of your coins.

You might like to collect foreign coins or your home country's currency.
You might like to collect smaller denominations or larger denominations
You might like to collect circulated coins in coin folders to try to complete a series such as your own life span.
You might like to collect uncirculated coins which have been available in the United States since the 1950s.
You might like to collect proof sets which are uncirculated coins prepared especially for collectors.
You might like to collect silver proof sets which are very beautiful (more affordable than gold) and their value will increase (or decrease) as the value of silver increases (or decreases).

,, Many will sell you rolls or bags of coins at face value.

, You can also visit your local coin dealer for buying coins and almost all the time there's a cheap coin bin that is suitable for kids and adults alike.

, Once a modern coin has been in circulation, it is typically only worth its face value, although there are notable exceptions.

, Grading coins is often difficult and there is a tendency for people to over grade their own coins. Also beware that the UK grading system grades coins more strictly than the US system. For example a US graded ""mint state"" might not be as good as an ""extremely fine"" coin in the UK. You should learn to grade coins ""by the book."" The American Numismatic Association has established standards for each of the US series. There is a tendency for the grading of actual coins for sale to be market graded or graded more leniently based on what the market will bear. If you keep in mind the strictest grading and use that when pricing coins for purchase, you will seldom go wrong.

, Coins with damage or deficiencies that go unnoticed at the time of purchase will sell for substantially less to a sharp-eyed coin dealer or numismatist.


There is another saying in numismatic circles, ""“The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low price is forgotten,” a statement generally attributed to Benjamin Franklin (though not about coins). These deficiencies will always stick out like a sore thumb once the coin is in your collection and will serve to diminish your pleasure of an otherwise enjoyable hobby. Keep in mind that coins with deficiencies (such as having been cleaned using mildly abrasive cleaning methods, being slightly bent, gouged) will be worth substantially less than a coin without problems. Such coins might be valued at 5-35% of the price of a problem free coin.

,, It is best to realize that what you like about coins, others will as well. Therefore, the numismatic value of your collection should grow over time, though not necessarily. Coins are often good investments, growing in value faster than the rate of inflation and, if you buy and sell carefully, there is money to be made.

, This is an oft-used saying in numismatics that means learn about the coins before spending a lot of money on them. One of the best ways to ""buy and sell carefully"" is to read the book before you buy the coin. There are many books on the market. First the catalog with basic information and price estimates. Then there are books available on individual series (the Lincoln Cent), types (ancient coins, mint errors, gold coins, tokens and medals etc.) There are books on grading coins which is important to determine value. Books are available on most any topic of coin collecting or Numismatics as it is more formally known. Knowledge is how we tell the difference between a rare coin and one that is common.

, Numismatic associations provide a range of opportunities to get information or buy and sell coins: Members of an association will meet regularly, young collectors can get advice from their well-versed colleagues, some of the members sell coins at comparatively low prices, and one will be informed about upcoming events. So, joining a numismatic association can help you quite a lot to further your hobby.

Sort your coins.,
Be patient.,
Soak in water.,
Use soap and water.,
Soak in olive oil.",How to Clean Ancient Coins1," Before you begin cleaning, sort through the coins to determine which coins need the most work. Split your coins into three categories: showing good detail, showing some detail, and showing no detail.Start working on the coins that need the least amount of work. Dirt can probably be removed by simply soaking them in distilled water. You may want to have the coins that need a lot of work cleaned by a professional.;
, It will take time to clean your ancient coins. Over-cleaning the coin can damage it and diminish the value of the coin. Also, some coins will have harder or more difficult deposits that will require more work. You may have to try multiple methods to get the coins clean. Start with the safest and least abrasive methods before you move on to something else., Place your coins in distilled water. The distilled water will absorb the materials that are on your coin and loosen the dirt. Do not use tap water because it may contain ions and mineral that will inhibit the cleaning process. Try scrubbing the coin with a toothbrush after it has been soaking for a few days. Change the water every few days as well.This is a slow process and may take many months until your coin is clean.

, If soaking in water alone has not helped, try to using some liquid soap to clean the coins.after you have applied soap and water to the coin, use a toothbrush to scrub the coin. If you do not have a toothbrush, you can use another stiff brush. However, never use a metal brush because the bristles will scratch your coin., Washing your coins with olive oil is the safest way to clean your coins as you cannot leave the coins in olive oil for too long. It has been used for years and is very reliable. Put olive oil in a closed container, and then place your coins in the container. Change the oil once or twice a month. If you want to speed up the process, gently scrub the coin with a toothbrush.Wait at least a week before you scrub the brush with a toothbrush. Scrub the coin with dish soap under running water. Place it back in the olive oil if it is still dirty.This is the slowest way to clean a coin. It may take months before you begin to see results.

Use a dental pick.,
Try using a knife.,
Consider using a magnifying tool.,
Try other hand cleaning tools.",How to Clean Ancient Coins2," You can purchase a dental pick at a local store (e.g. Target, Walgreens, Walmart, etc.). Do not start scraping with the point of the pick. Begin by turning the pick sideways and using a circular motion to remove the dirt and debris. A circular motion is better for your coins than moving he pick up and down or left to right., An X-acto knife can be used to scrape dirt off of your coins. Always use a curved blade instead of a flat blade as flat blades can really damage your coin. Hold the coin in your hand and then use the curved part of the blade to scrape the coin. Be very careful and go slowly when you do this.Use circular motions and keep the blade as flat as possible.

, A microscope, a magnifying glass, or a table magnifier can help you with your mechanical cleaning. This will allow you to see the coin and the details better. Different areas of the coin may need a different tool, and the magnification will allow you to see that. Make sure you have good lighting when you are cleaning., Toothpicks, plastic knives, and soft erasers can be used to clean the coins as well. All of these are made from materials that are softer than your coin so the risk of damage is minimal. Try different tools to see which works best on your coins. Also, wear safety glasses so you do not get any debris in your eyes.Work on a small area of the coin. You can apply a little bit of lubricant (i.e. olive oil) to help loosen the dirt as well."

Use electrolysis.,
Apply chemicals to your coin.,
Use Calgon.,
See a professional.",How to Clean Ancient Coins3," This method involves using an electrical flow to clean your coins. Wrap your coin in aluminum foil, but live the foil open around the edges a little bit. Pour malt vinegar into a shallow container and submerge the coin for 30 to 60 seconds. An electrical flow is created from the metal and the chemicals. Unwrap the coin and rub with your fingers to remove the debris. If the coin is very dirty, you may have to submerge it multiple times.You can also build an electrolysis machine using a battery/transformer, a wire, a tank, and a chemical solution.However, this is dangerous and is not recommended.There is a high probability of damaging your coin if you use this method., Chemicals can be used if your coin is heavily encrusted or has lime deposits. Be cautious when using chemicals to clean your coins. There is a higher chance of damaging your coin. Coca-cola, lemon juice, Noxon brass polish,, vinegar, and commercial bathroom cleaners (e.g. Lime-A-Way)are options. Let the coin sit in the chemicals for only a few minutes and then remove the coin and brush with a toothbrush. Test the chemicals with cheaper coins to see how long it take before the coin begins to erode. This can help you gauge how to treat your ancient coins.


Vinegar and lemon juice are less harsh than other acids. Dilute the lemon juice with 50% distilled water and let the coins soak for 10 minutes.Chemicals should be used as a last resort.

, Soak your coins in Calgon Water Softener to clean the coins. You can dilute the solution or use full strength solution. This will depend on the condition of your coin. Coins can be left in the solution anywhere from 1 day to 2 weeks. You must scrub the coin with a toothbrush every day when using Calgon. Check the coins to make sure that it is not being stripped by the solution., A professional coin cleaner is most qualified to clean your coins without damaging them.The cleaner will be able to evaluate your coin and determine the safest and best techniques. Professional coin cleaners can be found through the Numismatic Conservation Services website.Your coins will lose value after they have been cleaned. It is best to take your coin to a professional cleaner."

Gather together the pennies you want to clean.,
Pour a few ounces of vinegar into a shallow dish.,
Stir in a pinch of salt.,
Drop a few pennies into the vinegar solution.,
Let the pennies sit for 20-30 seconds.,
Scrub the pennies gently by hand.,
Rinse the pennies with clean water.,
Don’t soak the pennies for too long.,
Be sure to rinse thoroughly.,
Dry off the clean coins.,
Set aside a dedicated place for your change.",How to Clean Pennies with Vinegar," Go through your wallet, drawers, car and anywhere else that change tends to pile up to find pennies in need of cleaning. This process will work best on coins that are heavily tarnished or have a lot of stuck-on grime. The combination of vinegar and salt will cut through dirt and buildup effortlessly.Vinegar is most effective for cleaning copper. Other coins are molded from different metals, so the solution may not work as well on them.
If you don’t have any vinegar on hand, a 1:1 ratio of water to acetone will produce the same effect.;
, Select a dish with an opening wide enough to allow you to reach in and grab the coins. A bowl will work best, but you could also use a coffee mug or small Tupperware container. Fill the dish with enough liquid to totally submerge several pennies at once.For best results, use a pure, potent type of vinegar, such as distilled white vinegar.
Make sure you select a container that isn’t made of metal. The chemical reaction created by mixing salt and vinegar can also react with other types of metals, potentially causing rust, discoloration or mild corrosion., The exact amount of salt you add is not important—just grab a little bit with two fingers and sprinkle it in. Give the salt time to totally dissolve in the vinegar before you proceed to clean the pennies.Any variety of salt will do. It’s the chemical element that’s important, not the grains themselves.
Vinegar alone is not strong enough to remove the worst buildup from old pennies., Start with 4-5 pennies at a time to avoid overcrowding the dish. There should be enough room for each of the pennies to be completely immersed. Make sure the pennies stay separated at the bottom of the container.If you’re attempting to clean a large amount of pennies, you may need to empty the dish and mix up some fresh solution periodically.

, The vinegar and salt duo will act fast, so there’s no need to leave them in for too long. As the pennies soak, you should be able to notice the dark colored tarnish and other gunk melting away from the copper before your very eyes.Shake the pennies at the bottom of the dish as they soak to release even more buildup.
Especially dirty coins can be left to soak for up to five minutes., Remove the pennies from the solution one at a time and place them in the palm of your hand. Rub the pad of your finger over both faces of the penny to polish it. A little bit of friction will help buff away any remaining grime that the solution didn’t dissolve on its own.Go over the entire surface of the coin using smooth, circular motions.
You can also lightly scour the pennies using a toothbrush or cotton swab for a more thorough cleaning., Hold the pennies under the faucet for a few seconds, or swish them through a separate dish that’s filled with water. This will help flush away any loose dirt or vinegar coating the surface of the coin. When you’re done, the pennies should shine they like’re fresh out of the mint!Once you’ve rinsed the pennies, set them aside on a layer of paper towels to dry.
You may not be able to erase every last trace of discoloration on very old pennies. Eventually, other substances can set up in the metal, making them more or less permanent.

, After a few minutes, the same reaction that dissolves stuck-on grime can begin to eat away at the copper. This may cause the pennies to give off an odd metallic residue, staining your hands or the container they’re in. In most cases, 30 seconds to a minute, in conjunction with some manual polishing, should be enough to do the trick.This can be especially damaging for pennies that already have a significant amount of scratching and wear.

, A good rinsing is needed to flush the acetic acid from the vinegar off the pennies. If left on the copper, this can lead to a buildup of a chemical called malachite, which will turn the pennies a bluish-green color. Since your original goal was to return the pennies to their original copper color, it’s important not to skip this step.A quick wash will also help neutralize the overpowering odor of the vinegar.

, Though pennies don’t actually rust, they can corrode and develop an unsightly chemical buildup when exposed to water. To keep this from occurring, pat the pennies dry with a towel after you clean them. That way, their finish will stay brighter and more vibrant for much longer.It’s okay to let the coins air dry, as long as there’s no standing water on them.

, Coins can get dirty in no time at all in places like the kitchen counter or your car’s cup holders. Consider buying a coin bank that you can keep your small currency in until you cash it in or spend it. Having a central place to stash your coins will minimize their chances of contamination and prevent you from losing them.You might also use a small drawstring bag or jar, or carry it with you in a change purse.
Placing your coins in a lidded container will defend them from deterioration-causing germs and moisture."

Hold the piece in your hand and feel its weight.,

Run your fingers over the item to feel its texture.,

Examine the item's patina and surface through a magnifying glass.",How to Tell Ivory from Bone1," Ivory feels heavy and dense when you hold it in your hand. Think of the weight of a billiard ball, which ivory has been used to make in the past; when you hold one in your hand, it feels sturdy and solid. If the item in question feels strangely lightweight, you can eliminate the possibility that it's ivory.

Bone can have the exact same weight as ivory, so just because the piece feels solid and heavy doesn't mean it is indeed ivory.
If you're unsure whether the item feels appropriately solid, weigh it, then compare its weight to similar items that you know to be ivory. The internet is a great resource for finding the dimensions and weight of ivory items.;
, Ivory is said to be as smooth as butter. It's not as soft, but in the right hands it's almost as easy to carve. If the surface of the piece feels rutted and pockmarked, it might not be ivory. If it feels unbelievably smooth, you may have ivory on your hands., It's not always possible to tell for sure whether an item is ivory by looking under a magnifying glass, but doing so should provide good clues. Real ivory is lustrous and beautiful, often with a slightly yellowish hue. It can also take on a brownish patina caused by the oils of those who have handled it over the years. If you see spots or other odd markings, though, it probably isn't ivory. Look for the following identifiers:
Cross-hatched lines. There should be parallel lines (with slight irregularities) running along the length of the item. Perpendicular to these should be circular or V-shaped lines known as Schreger lines. These are found in all elephant and mammoth ivory.Does the surface have multiple darkened dots or pits? If so, this is a very good indicator of its being bone. In some cases the bone has been bleached, though, so keep performing other tests to be sure.
All bone has the telltale flecks of marrow, or tiny notches, in the surface. These may not be visible to the naked eye, but you should be able to see them through a magnifying glass. Ivory tends to be smoother, harder, and not pitted."
"

Heat a straight pin.,

Hold the pin to the surface of the item.,

Smell the place where you touched the item with the hot pin.",How to Tell Ivory from Bone2," Hold it over a candle flame or a lighter flame for a few seconds until it gets quite hot. You can use any piece of metal, but a pin is a good choice since you don't want to create a mark on the item you're testing., Choose a discreet spot so you don't end up leaving a mark or a dent (although if the item is ivory, this won't happen)., If the item is ivory, it should have no scent that wasn't there before. If it's bone, it will smell faintly of burning hair.

True ivory will not get damaged by this experiment, since it is hard and strong enough to resist the heat. However, if the object you're testing happens to be made of plastic, the hot needle will make a slight dent. Since some plastics (such as Bakelite) have as much or more value than ivory, you may not want to try the hot needle test until you know for sure that what you have is not plastic.

Have the item appraised by an antiques dealer.,

Have the item chemically tested.",How to Tell Ivory from Bone3," Antiques dealers have handled hundreds or thousands of ivory, bone, and plastic pieces, and they're usually quite adept at figuring out which is which using the methods outlined above as well as their own knowledge about the ivory trade.

Be sure to find a reputable dealer to appraise the item. Don't go into just any antique store; find a place the specializes in ivory so you can be sure the information you get is correct.
Antiques shows are a good place to get items appraised. Check online to find out whether a show will be coming to your area.

, To leave absolutely no question about the composition of your ivory or bone item, take it to a forensics lab and have it chemically tested by a scientist. The cellular structure of ivory is different from that of bone, but lab equipment is required to determine which is which with finality."

True antique is a collectable at least a century old, according to the majority of antique dealers.This is based on tradition and the customs laws of various countries, though some societies define it as anytime before 1930. True antiques are considered desirable because of their age, beauty, rarity, condition, or personal connection.

Near antique is an item between 75 to 99 years old.

Vintage is a broad definition that means 'of a certain time'. It is the description used for a range of collectibles, and especially those from the 40s, 50s and 60s.

Collectables are any items valued or sought at by collectors. These can be from any era and vary in price depending on rarity and condition.;
, The best antique buys are ones that match your personal interests. Suppose you're an art lover, for example. What would you like to obtain? A certain kind of object, such as antique sculptures? A piece from a certain artist? Artwork from a certain period (ie: post-impressionism)? Think about your personal interests and use that to narrow your search.

Read guides about your special interests to determine what exactly you want to collect. Within a certain era or type of item, there are many different brands or styles to consider. The value of your item will vary greatly depending on age, brand, and condition. Keep these three criteria in mind as you research.
If you're collecting as a hobby, buy what you love, not what is most valuable. You'll want to collect what you enjoy, not what costs most.

, If you want to make money buying and selling antiques, research valuable antique items within a certain era or subset. You will work much more efficiently if you can narrow your focus. Choose a focus with high value among antique hobbyists and current trending interest.

Whether you collect or sell, have your items appraised. This is to make sure your insurance covers the value of all your antiques in the event of theft, damage or loss. Appraisal will also give you a good idea of what your items are worth.

, Before you begin shopping, decide beforehand how much you want to spend on antiques. Even the most seasoned antique buyers can get carried away and buy more than they can afford. Keep a close eye on your funds and promise yourself not to exceed them, even if you want to later.

If you are selling your items, think about how quickly you will be able to sell the item and for how much (in as accurate an estimate as you can). When you find a valuable item that you think will sell quickly, you may justify going over your budget a little. Use your best judgment, and don't buy anything that will put you in serious debt.
Learn from your mistakes. If you overpay on an item or bought something worth less than you thought, that's just part of antique collecting. Like other hobbies, you'll get better as you go along.

, If a vendor uses these terms online, at a store, or during an auction, you'll have a good idea of what quality to expect.


Mint condition means that the piece is not cracked, chipped, or broken. This antique is in perfect condition.Excellent condition means that the piece has some minor flaws. The antique may have small chips or has been repaired over time.
Good condition means that the piece is in a presentable state.Antiques in good condition may have noticeable cracks or chips, and they might require repair after you buy it.

, The less common an antique is, the more likely it has a high value. Rare items may have been made in limited amounts, or the amount of the items may have decreased over time. Items that are difficult to reproduce in the contemporary era (such as items made of limited materials) are especially coveted among collectors.Rarity could also be determined by a manufacturing abnormality (like an unusual glass color for a certain era)or, in the case of art, an uncommon subject matter for a certain artist.
Rarity raises the value of a piece alongside desirability. Some antiques, such as a certain edition of a book, were initially commonplace. Decades or even centuries later, their desirability increases because of their historical significance or scarcity over time.

, When looking at an antique, you may not know how to tell if this is an authentic piece. Research the antique and check for signs of its authenticity. Be on particular lookout for artist signatures, materials used, and era markers.

Even if an antique looks old, it might not be from that era. Really convincing hoaxes use old materials to create their pieces. When in doubt, enlist the help of an antique broker or specialist.If your piece has bronze mounts, unscrew one. On antique bronzed pieces, there will be two colors on the back: the dark, oxidized center and the tiny rim of gilding in the front. If your bronze mounts have a gilded back, your piece may be authentic.

, Even small chips can lower your antique's worth from mint to excellent (or excellent to good). Examine the item thoroughly and look for any cracks, chipped paint, or other signs of wear. Research what mint condition looks like for your antique and compare to spot any small damages.

If you collect furniture or other wood items, look out for wormwood damage.These will look like little holes in the wood. The older the wood, the more holes you'll see. Wormwood damage is not necessarily negative: it can be a sign that the object is as old as the vendor claims.

, After you have bought an item, bring it to an antiques collector who can tell you how much it's worth. Before the appraisal, prepare a mental inventory of where you found the item, how much you paid for it, and any other information you know about the item.This will help the appraiser assess its worth accurately.

Some auction houses have ""appraisal days"" where they invite people to bring their antiques and have them appraised for free or a reduced cost. Check local auction house websites and mark appraisal day dates down in your calendar.

, Antique shops are great places to find cheap deals on rare items.In local shops, especially little-known ones, the condition may not be as great as you'll find at auctions. You never know, though: you may just find a high value item for a low price.

Research before you buy. If you're not sure how much an item is worth or if it is authentic, read up on the item and return later. Some antique shops will let you put an item ""on hold"" while you decide.
When on vacation or out-of-town, check out antique shops in the area. Especially make time for antique shopping when in big cities, as you are more likely to find special items.

, Flea markets are great places to buy antique furniture, trinkets, and jewelry for a low price. Search online for local flea market listings and think beforehand what items you want to look for. When you arrive, move from booth to booth and take notes of items you like.When you have visited every booth, return to items of interest and negotiate a price with the vendor.

Arrive early to make sure you're getting a wide selection to choose from.
Bring cash. Most flea market vendors will not accept cards or checks.
Talk to vendors, and ask if they have additional information about their wares. If you have more questions, perform an online search on your phone to research the item's authenticity and its value.

, Famous auction houses like Sotheby's and Christie's can be visited online, and you can browse items for sale on their websites. Check the local classifieds for people selling collectables.


eBay can be a hot spot for antiques, near antiques, and vintages (especially because you can narrow your search easily). When you find something that interests you, read the entire listing and check out the seller to make sure they're trustworthy. Ask for photos if none are on the listing. You can then either bid on the item or choose the ""Buy It Now"" option, usually for a higher price.Connect with other antique buyers via online forums. There you can discuss the latest trends in antique buying/selling and receive advice from more seasoned hobbyists.
Don't believe everything you see on the internet. Double check any information you read, and consider the information you find an open dialogue rather than a finished resource., Remember the saying, ""One man's trash, is another man's treasure?"" You never know what hidden valuables you may find at a garage sale, and you'll be able to purchase them at a bargain. Check online listings beforehand or go looking for yard sale signs in the morning and check out what others have to offer.

Ask questions. If you find something you believe is an antique, ask the seller what they know about this item. Is it a family heirloom, or did they buy it? Where did they buy it from? What other information can they tell you about the object?
Pay special attention to estate sale listings. Estate sales can be a treasure trove of antiques.Relatives of the deceased may have information about the items and their origin, or if the estate owner was an antique collector.

, Sometimes people donate old items believing that they're worthless when they are, in fact, rare antiques. Thrift stores are another place where you can find antiques for a fraction of their worth.

Most thrift stores add new inventory every week. Ask an employee what day they bring in new inventory and choose that day each week to look for antiques.

, If you want to find high quality items, buy from an antique broker in your special interest. An antique broker can guarantee the item's authenticity and offer you a fair price based on their assessment.Antique dealers are more likely to be knowledgeable about their wares and answer any questions you may have.

Let the antique dealer know what your budget is and how experienced you are. They can then make recommendations based on your price range and interest level.
Make sure your antique broker is reputable and has an established presence in your special interest's culture. If you have doubts, check online reviews.
Don't be afraid to haggle. Many antique dealers are flexible in their prices and can be negotiated with. If you have limited funds, let them know, and they may work out a deal with you.

, Sotheby's, Christie's and other auction houses have offices all around the world.You will be able to see the pieces more closely before they are auctioned, and make a better decision whether or not you want a particular piece. Look online for auctions happening in your area, and find one that best meets your interests.

Some auctions revolve around a specific theme, such as art or items from a certain era. Spend time at auctions where you can bid on items related to your interests, and avoid auctions beyond your interests.

, Most auctions require bidders to pre-register online so they can be assigned a bidding number. Your bidding number will be written on the sign you hold up in the air so the auctioneer can track your intentions. If you don't register, you cannot bid.Sometimes you can also register on-site. Call or email the auction house ahead of time to learn their specific rules.

, You don't want to come late to your first auction, especially when the atmosphere will be so new. Arriving early ensures you a good seat and view of the lot items. You'll also be able to make sure that you see the auctioneer and that they see you., Learn the rules of the game before you play. Observing an auction will help you understand what auctions involve and avoid making mistakes when you bid for the first time. You will also get a sense of how people bid and reasonable price increases.

Talk to more experienced auction-goers and ask them what advice they'd give to a beginner. If you connect with other antique buyers at the auction, you'll feel more comfortable and receive indispensable advice.
If your first auction overwhelms you, attend a few before you participate. There's no shame in waiting before you first bid. You'll want to prepare yourself as much as possible.

, Talk with the auctioneer beforehand and bring up any questions you have. Auctioneers love to interact with the bidders and will be happy to help you with any concerns. Ask the auctioneer how long they believe it will take to get through each lot so you know how long to stay.

Remember to ask them what forms of payment they accept. Many auction houses only accept cash but some may accept credit cards or checks.

, Before the auction begins, inspect items you're interested in to get a sense of their condition.Antique items are sold ""as is."" If you are a seller, items that you have to repair may be of less value than ones in good condition.

Keep in mind the cost of repair before bidding, and consider whether the item is worth buying in its condition or if the damages exceed its value.
Many auction houses add a buyer's premium and local tax to the item after bidding. Keep this in mind, too, when considering its worth.
Inspection times are often set by the auctioneer. Know the time frame beforehand to avoid rushing.

, When you want to bid, raise your card number high and keep it raised until the auctioneer notices you. If the auctioneer misses you, keep your hand raised until they call your number.

Whether you bid or not is your decision. Consider bidding early, however, so the auctioneer knows to watch your number for future bids.
When the hammer falls, the sale is over. A bidder can withdraw their bid until the fall of the hammer, but afterwards, the bidder is legally obligated to buy the item.
If the hammer falls but your card was raised, talk to the auctioneer afterwards to dispute the sale and ask them to reopen the bid. The auctioneer does not have to comply but may reopen if you make your intentions clear.

, If you're unable to visit live auction, consider bidding at online auctions. Online auctions can be just as fast-paced as the real thing, and you can often find items more related to your interests.Take care when participating in online auctions, as it is much harder to determine quality. Research as much as you can about the item (and the seller) to assess its authenticity.
You can also participate in some auctions via your phone. This is called an absentee bid. To bid via phone, you are required to fill out a form either on paper or online. When your form is processed, you are registered to bid.

Remove the objects from the oxidizing solution.,
Rinse the items with clean water and dry them with a clean cloth towel.

,
Restore a shine to selective parts of the metal objects by rubbing with fine steel wool, in order to provide contrast and an authentically worn look.",How to Antique Metal1," you are antiquing. Most store-bought oxidizers contain muriatic or hydrochloric acid as the primary corrosive agent., You’ll need to work outdoors or in a well-ventilated area of your home as the fumes from chemical oxidizers can be toxic., Wear thick rubber gloves and safety goggles.

,, Even the fumes from the process can oxidize and damage them.

, Use a glass container (not metal, plastic or wood) to mix 1 part oxidizer to 20 parts water to begin and strengthen gradually as needed.

, Keep them in the solution until they achieve a desired darkness or blackness, typically a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes.


You can also apply the solution with a brush or cotton swab to control coloration.

, Then cover them in baking soda or ammonia to neutralize the acid and stop the oxidizing process.

,,


Alternatively, you can tumble small items in a rotary tumbler with steel shot to brighten and shine parts of the metal.

Prepare your workspace.,
Prepare the liver of sulphur.,
Prime the metal for antiquing.,
Clean the metal with a paste of pumice and water, then rinse.

,
Apply the liver of sulphur mixture with a soft, round brush sized according to the area you wish to antique.,
Rinse the object with cold water to stop the oxidation process.

,
Finish the antiquing process by brushing the metal with a soft brass brush and a gentle dish detergent to even out the finish.",How to Antique Metal2," Cover a work table with a thick plastic sheet, and wear protective rubber gloves and safety goggles.

, Heat 1 to 2 cups (237 to 474 mL) to a boil and pour the water in a heatproof glass bowl or disposable container. Then, add a pea-size amount of liver of sulphur and mix.


Also known as potassium sulfide, liver of sulphur comes in a variety of forms, including liquid, gel and solid. , Create a texture or “tooth” on the surfaces you wish to antique by rubbing with a piece of sandpaper between 9 and 15-grit.

,, You can also place the entire object in mixture until the desired color is achieved.

,, Use a polishing cloth if you wish to further lighten some of the oxidized areas.

Place 1 to 6 eggs (depending on the amount of metal) in a pot of water and bring to a boil.,
Remove the egg shells immediately and carefully.

,
Cut the eggs in quarters while still hot and place in a clear (glass or plastic) container with metal.,
Monitor the oxidizing process without opening the container every 5 to 10 minutes initially.,
Remove the metal from the container and discard the eggs.,
Rub a polishing cloth or steel wool to lighten certain oxidized areas of the metal objects to create a naturally-worn look.

",How to Antique Metal3," Then turn off heat and leave in hot water for about 10 minutes.

,, Prevent the egg from touching metal directly and cover the container.


Egg yolks produce sulfur that will oxidize the metal.

, Then leave the metal in the container with the eggs for one to two hours at room temperature or overnight if placed in refrigerator until desired coloration is reached.

, Allow the metal objects to air out to remove the sulfuric egg smell.

Don't rub the coins.,
Use an aerosol sprayer for gentle cleaning.,
Use distilled water if needed.,
Dry with air or a blow dryer.,
Store the coins carefully.",How to Care for Rainbow‐Toned or Monster‐Toned Fine Silver Coins," Toning can be cleaned off of the coin by vigorous rubbing or polishing. You do not want your beautiful colors cleaned off your coin of course, so never rub or wipe the surface with anything.;
, If you must clean the coin's surface due to dust, lint or other foreign matter, you can gently remove it from the capsule and use an aerosol sprayer like those used to dust electronics to blow away any debris that is on the coins surface. Remember not to shake the can or you might get propellant blown onto your coin. Make sure to clean the capsule also before replacing the coin.

, If the foreign matter is still on the coin, you can run water over it under the tap. It would be best to use distilled water, but not necessary as long as your water is not very heavily chlorinated. Chlorine is not good for silver. Let the water run over the coin for a minute or two; this should dislodge any debris., To dry it, it is best to use that aerosol air can mentioned earlier to dry the coin, or use a blow dryer. If you don't have an air sprayer or blow dryer you can lay the coin on a micro fibre cloth or paper towel (unbleached is preferred but not necessary) and place another piece of paper towel or cloth over it. Then you can very gently press on it but do not rub! Even if the coin is fresh from the mint with no toning, you never ever rub the surface with anything., Let the coin finish air drying for a few minutes before returning it to it's capsule. Keep the coins in their airtight capsules and they will maintain their beautiful colors for years.

Make sure the object is brass.,
Learn what to do if your object is not brass.,
If the brass is lacquered, remove it with nail polish remover.,
Pour hot water over the object after treating it with nail polish remover.,
If there is a thin protective film or no finish at all, wash with gentler materials.,
Dry completely before continuing.",How to Antique Brass1," Some other metals look similar to brass, but will respond differently to these aging methods. The wrong treatment could corrode your object, so take your object to an antique shop or other expert if you can't identify it yourself.


Clean brass has a bright, golden brown appearance. The most similar metals in appearance are copper, which is brown or pink-brown, and bronze, which is a much darker brown.Brass is slightly magnetic, but should only respond noticeably to a powerful magnet. If a small magnet sticks firmly to the surface, you probably have an object made from a different metal, then plated with a thin layer of brass.;
, If your object is only brass-plated, try using a gentle treatment such as vinegar or salt water, as harsher materials may corrode through the thin brass layer. If you are trying to age copper, see these linked instructions. To antique bronze, purchase a ""bronze ager"" and follow the Using Antiquing Solution method.

, Lacquer is a clear, hard, protective finish that prevents the brass from oxidizing, which is the aging process you're trying to encourage or imitate. Apply the nail polish remover, also known as acetone, to the object to strip off the lacquer.Wear rubber gloves and work in a ventilated area to avoid inhaling fumes.
Let small objects soak in the acetone.
Use a paintbrush to brush the chemical onto large objects. Be sure to coat every corner of the object.
Methyl alcohol, paint remover, or lacquer thinner will also do the job., Wait a few minutes or until the lacquer is peeling off or dissolving into goo. Wash the object in hot water to remove the lacquer


Check to make sure there is no remaining lacquer. Modern brass objects are often protected with tough lacquer that can take several attempts to remove entirely.

, If the object feels greasy or has a thin layer of polish on it, you can probably clean it with a cloth soaked in rubbing alcohol or a 50/50 mix of vinegar and water. For completely untreated brass, a thorough wash with soap and water should be enough to prepare it for antiquing.


Wear gloves even when using these skin-safe cleaning products, since oils from your hand can get on the brass and prevent the antiquing effect from taking place evenly.

, Do not begin the antiquing process until the brass is completely dry. A hair dryer, propane torch, or oven can speed up this process.Be cautious when applying heat to a brass object that recently had its lacquer removed. If you missed a piece of lacquer, it could catch on fire or release fumes. Dry the brass in a well-ventilated area with no flammable objects nearby.
You can now use any of the methods described below. If you're unsure which to use, read the first step of each one to learn the benefits of each option.

Use vinegar or salt water to antique your brass safely and easily.,
Apply salt water to make brass slightly darker.,
Coat with vinegar instead for more pronounced aging.,
Use vinegar vapors for a warm brown appearance.,
Whichever method you used, wash with warm water and dry.",How to Antique Brass2," Any type of household vinegar or even table salt in water can be used to antique brass. This can take longer to take effect than the other methods — several hours for vinegar, and up to several days with salt water— but you do not have to handle any dangerous chemicals and probably already have the necessary ingredients in your kitchen.


Prepare the brass first as described above to ensure the antiquing succeeds.
Wear rubber gloves for any method to prevent getting oil on the brass.

, A mix of equal parts table salt and water will oxidize the brass, simply speeding up the natural aging process brass undergoes. Apply it with a small paintbrush over the entire surface and reapply daily until you've achieved the appearance you enjoy., Apply with a brush or simply dip the piece in any type of vinegar. Allow it to dry, then apply an additional coat if you'd like a darker color.


Mix a spoonful of table salt into the vinegar for a greener patina.Heating the brass with a hair dryer or oven to around 450ºF (230ºC) will produce more noticeable results, but you'll need oven mitts or thick gardener gloves to handle it at this temperature., This may not achieve the authentic appearance that ammonia or antiquing solution will, but some people prefer the ""gingerbread"" appearance that results.In any case, it is certainly safer and less expensive than those methods.


Pour some vinegar into a plastic bucket with an airtight lid.
Place wooden blocks or other objects into the bucket so a stable, flat surface is dry above the level of the vinegar.
Place the brass on top of the objects.
Seal the lid to trap the vinegar fumes and let them alter the brass for several hours or overnight.

, Once the result you want is achieved, which may take several applications, wash the brass in warm water. Dry it gently with a towel or by applying heat.


Once it is dry, you have the option to preserve its color by coating with a brass lacquer or wax.

"
"
To age brass rapidly, purchase an antiquing solution.,
Use rubber gloves, safety goggles, and good ventilation.,
Dilute the antiquing solution according to the manufacturer's instructions.,
While wearing gloves, agitate the brass object beneath the surface of the antiquing solution.,
Watch the color change and pull out when the desired color is reached.,
Rinse the object to highlight (optional).,
Dry evenly.,
Treat with lacquer or wax to preserve the current color (optional).",How to Antique Brass3," This is the quickest of all methods, but it does require you to purchase a specialized product. These are sold as antiquing solutions or brass agers. The specific brand will determine the appearance of the antiqued piece, but the process should be similar regardless.Always follow the instructions for Preparing Your Brass before beginning any antiquing method.
This is not a good method to follow if you're not certain that your piece is solid brass. See Using Vinegar or Salt Water instead.

, Antiquing solutions can be made with a variety of chemicals, most of which can damage skin and eyes or release toxic fumes. Protect yourself with basic safety equipment and open the windows before you begin.


Be especially careful if your product contains any of these hazardous chemicals: ammonium hydroxide, glacial acetic acid, nitric acid, or sulfuric acid., Read the label carefully. Some solutions may not require diluting, whereas others require as much as 10 parts water to 1 part antiquing solution. Use room temperature water and mix in a ceramic or plastic container large enough to submerge the entire brass object.Do not use container made from other materials, as the acids in the solution could corrode them.
Do not fill the container too full. Leave room to fit the brass object without the container overflowing.

, Hold the brass in the solution and move back and forth to dislodge air bubbles. Make sure the solution covers the entire object, but doesn't reach near the top of your gloves.


Air bubbles that remain on the brass will cause bright spots where the brass was not aged.Turn the brass object in your gloves so you get even exposure to the solution.

, It should take between a few seconds and a couple minutes to begin changing colors, moving from pink to red to brown to black. Pull it out when you see the color you're aiming for.


If you plan to brighten your object with highlighting (see below), let it get slightly darker than the color you want.Don't worry that you'll ruin your brass. If you pulled it out too early, simply put it back and shake again. If you pulled it out too late, scrub with a scotch-brite pad or lightly with steel wool to remove the color so you can try again.

, Rinse with hot water and clean off the resulting white powder using a sponge or scotch-brite pad. This results in a brighter, accented object compared to the darker, even patina it had immediately after treatment.


If you are trying to create a black or almost black patina, you'll have better results getting the patina to stay if you dip it in two or three stages, rinsing between each one.

, Once you are satisfied with the color, immediately dry the whole object. Wet patches will dry darker than the rest of the surface. You may want to use a paper towel or rag, since some color could rub off onto it.

, Applying a brass lacquer or other brass finishing treatment will prevent the brass from aging further. This is recommended if the brass is handled frequently or if you want to preserve the current color.

Apply ammonia periodically to produce the most natural aged appearance.,
Buy ammonia and a sealable bucket from a hardware store.,
Wear rubber gloves, safety goggles, and work only in areas with excellent ventilation.,
Place a wooden block in the bottom of the bucket.,
Pour ammonia into the bucket.,
Place the brass objects on the wooden ""shelf"".,
Seal the lid and check back periodically.,
Let the brass dry in a ventilated area.",How to Antique Brass4," Ammonia is a caustic substance that should be treated with caution, but it does come closer than any other method to creating the green brown appearance of naturally aged brass.


Ammonia will eventually evaporate off the brass, so you'll need to commit to repeating this process every time your brass returns to its old appearance. How long this takes depends on the exact qualities of your object.
This process will not succeed if you do not follow the steps for Preparing Your Brass beforehand.

, You'll need ""full strength"" or ""clear"" ammonia, not the dilute household ammonia more commonly sold at supermarkets. The hardware store is also a good place to buy a plastic bucket with airtight sealable lid, sometimes called ""pickle buckets"".For tiny pieces of brass, you can use a glass bottle with airtight cap instead of a bucket. Tie it with a cord and suspend it over a small amount of ammonia, screwing the cap firmly to hold the cord in place and trap the ammonia fumes.

, Ammonia fumes are toxic and should never be inhaled. Work outside if possible or in a room with great air flow.

, You should create a stable, flat ""shelf"" large enough for the brass object to sit on. Use a piece of plywood for large objects, stacked on top of several pieces of wood to make it stable.

, Keep the ammonia level below the upper surface of the wood. You don't need too much, although more ammonia may hasten the process.

, Make sure they are stable and in no danger of falling into the ammonia. If they do, remove it with gloved hands and wash in warm water. Dry before returning to the wooden bucket.

, Depending on the temperature and humidity, freshness of the ammonia, and exact characteristics of your brass, the antiquing could take hours to take effect. Check back every hour or so to see how its progressing, taking care not to breathe the fumes that escape the bucket.


Open the lid slightly for a quick glance, then close it tightly to keep most of the ammonia fumes in.

, Once the desired color is reached, let it dry naturally in an area with flowing air. Wax it if you want a more polished effect.


The aging effect of ammonia is only temporary, so you probably don't want to lacquer the brass since you would eventually need to remove the lacquer to re-antique the brass.
You can use the same ammonia bath to treat other brass objects, but not indefinitely. Eventually the ammonia's potency will be used up and you will need to replace it."
"
Look for a stamp.,
Evaluate the international silver stamp rating.",How to Test Silver1," Items advertised as silver and sold internationally should be stamped based on its silver content. If there is no stamp, be leery. It may be still be pure silver, but created in a country that doesn't require stamping.;
, Look at the silver piece with a magnifying glass. International sellers of silver will stamp silver as 925, 900 or 800. These numbers indicate the percentage of fine silver in the piece. 925 means that the piece is 92.5 percent silver. A stamp of 900 or 800 means the piece is 90 percent or 80 percent silver, and is often called ""coin"" silver.

"
"
Test with a magnet.,
Try the sliding test.",How to Test Silver2," In particular, use a strong magnet, such as the rare-earth magnet made out of neodymium. Silver is paramagnetic and exhibits only weak magnetic effects. If your magnet sticks strongly to the piece, it has a ferromagnetic core and is not silver.


Keep in mind that there are a few other metals that do not stick to a magnet and can be made to look like silver. It is better to perform the magnetic test in conjunction with another test to make sure the core is not another metal.

, If you are testing silver bars, there is another way you can use a magnet to see if your silver is real or not. Angle one of your silver bars so that it is at a 45 degree angle. Slide the magnet down it. The magnet should slide slowly down the face of the bar. This may seem counterintuitive, but silver is paramagnetic and the rare earth magnet induces electric eddy currents in the silver which act as an electromagnet to create a braking effect that slows the descent of the magnet.

"
"
Have some ice on hand.,
Place your piece of ice directly on the silver.",How to Test Silver3," Keep it in the freezer until you need it for the test. While it might not seem like ice and silver go together, silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any common metal or alloy, though copper is right behind.


This test works well with coins and bars but will be harder to perform on silver jewelry.

, Do not take your eyes off of it. The ice will begin to melt immediately, as if it has been placed on something hot, rather than as if it it was placed on something that was just room temperature."
"
Try the ring test with any coin.,
Drop your own coin on a flat surface from about six inches above it.",How to Test Silver4," Silver makes a really lovely bell-like ringing sound when it is tapped on, particularly when it is tapped on with another form of metal. If you want to try this out before tapping on your questionable silver, find a United States quarter made before 1965. These were made of 90% silver while US quarters made later than 1964 are made of a copper-nickel alloy. The older quarter will give a high-pitched, clear ringing tone, while the newer quarters will give a dull thump of a sound., If it makes a sound like a bell ringing, you have a real silver coin in your hand. If it's dull, the silver is, most likely, mixed with other metals.

"
"
Perform a chemical test analysis on the item.,
Buy a silver acid test.,
Find an inconspicuous place on the item in question and make a small scratch on the silver piece.,
Apply a drop of acid to the scratched surface only.,
Analyze the scratched surface with the acid on it.",How to Test Silver5," Use a chemical analysis if there's no stamp signifying it is silver on your piece. Put on a pair of gloves. You will be using a corrosive acid to test the piece for purity. These sort of acids burn skin.Note that this method has the potential to slightly damage your silver item. If you suspect you have a high value item, you might be better off trying to determine the silver content using one of the other methods listed in this article.

, You can purchase these online at sites like Amazon or eBay, or at jewelry stores. Silver acid tests are great for pure silver, but if you think your piece is silver plated, you will have to use a small jeweler's file to make a mark, revealing what might be under the plating.

, This is necessary to get to the underlying metal to test it with acid. Scratch the piece using a metal file. Scratch the surface enough so that you can get beyond any silver plating layer.If you don’t want to scratch your piece, or potentially leave a mark from the acid, use a black stone plate. These are generally provided with a silver testing kit, or will be sold in the same store. Rub your silver on the surface of the black stone so that it leaves a thick and relatively large deposit on the stone. Aim for a line that is one to one-half inch thick.

, If the acid touches any area of the piece that isn't scratched, it will affect the polished look of the piece. If you chose to use a black stone, add a drop of the acid on the line that you created on your stone.

, You will have to analyze the color that appears as the acid sinks into the piece. Be sure to follow the instructions and color scale of your specific silver test. In general, the color scale is as follows::


Bright Red: Fine Silver
Darker Red: 925 Silver
Brown : 800 Silver
Green : 500 Silver
Yellow: Lead or Tin
Dark brown: Brass
Blue: Nickel

Simply put a drop of bleach on your item.,
Watch for tarnishing or no reaction.,
Note that silver plated items will pass this test.

",How to Test Silver6," Silver tarnishes extremely quickly when exposed to a powerful oxidizing agent such as common bleach.

, If it rapidly tarnishes and turns black then the item is silver.

Put on gloves to protect your hands from the paints and chemicals you will use.,
Place the mirror you intend to antique face down on a washable or disposable surface.,
Apply paint stripper to the back of the mirror.,
Remove paint with a plastic putty knife.,
Wash the mirror in warm water and soap, removing all remnants of paint stripper.

,
Dry the mirror thoroughly.

,
Place the mirror face down on a new piece of cardboard or a washable surface.

,
Apply black patina solution to the mirror.,
Work from the edges inwards.

,
Rinse the mirror with water when the desired level of antiquing has occurred.,
Air dry thoroughly.

,
Apply paint to the entirety of the back of the mirror.,
Wait until paint has dried.",How to Antique Mirrors,"


Latex gloves work best because they protect your hands while allowing you maximum dexterity.;
, A piece of cardboard works well for this purpose.

, Wait several hours, or until the paint can be easily removed.

, If it doesn't come off relatively easily, wait longer for the paint stripper to work.


To make mirrors look like antiques, it's not favorable to remove all paint. Aim for around 80 to 90 percent.

,,,, Use a 1-inch (2.5 cm) paintbrush.


The black patina solution is basically acid. It will generally begin to eat through and tarnish the reflective surface in about 1 minute.
Naturally antique mirrors are often more tarnished on the outside edges than the middle. If you want to replicate a genuine antique look, work in this fashion.

,,


Water neutralizes the acid and will stop the antiquing effect of the patina.

,, Use a new paintbrush so there isn't any remaining patina on the paintbrush itself.


Whatever color of paint you choose will show through where the patina solution created spots. Choose black, silver, or gold for the most antique look. Also consider painting the back with a random combination of dark and light paint colors.

, Hang the mirror in desired location.

Shop around old salvage yards or thrift stores for small pieces of ivory.,
Buy a pen-like X-acto knife with a replaceable head.,
Get some good quality beeswax, black, brown or blue ink and some acetone nail polish remover.

,
Apply beeswax to the surface of the bone or ivory to seal it.,
Use a cloth and work the beeswax into the surface by hand for five minutes if you don’t have a tool with which to apply it.,
With a clean cloth, buff the ivory until all the beeswax has been removed.,
Measure your piece of ivory.,
Find an image online and shrink it to the size of the object.,
Print the image on a home computer or copy it from a book to a sheet of paper.

,
Place the ivory on top of it and draw an outline of the ivory over the sheet of paper.,
Place the illustration face down.,
Lift up the edge of the paper and peel it back quickly.,

Begin shading the drawing by etching crosshatched lines.,
Apply more ink with cotton swabs and wipe it off.,
Replace your pin as necessary when it begins to dull.

,
Survey your work.,
Wipe all the extra ink off the surface of the bone.

,
Grab your beeswax-covered cloth.",How to Scrimshaw," If you are using whale ivory, make sure it was harvested before 1972, when the Marine Protection Act outlawed whaling in America. You can also use old ivory piano keys, bone or white acrylic., Insert a pin into the front and secure the pinhead inside the knife.

,, If possible, attach a disk to a Dremel tool and apply the beeswax to the disc. Then, apply the beeswax evenly to the surface of the ivory, coating it completely.


Why seal the ivory? Ivory is very porous. Sealing keeps the ink that’s tattooed into the ivory from spilling over into unwanted sections, leaving an inky cloud. When properly sealed, the ivory will absorb ink only into the grooves that you etch into it.

, Rub the wax cloth over and over against the ivory until it has a uniform surface.

, The ivory should look shiny but not feel very waxy. Set the beeswax cloth aside, since you will need it later.

, You will want a small detailed drawing to use as your scrimshaw design.

, Remember to leave one-half inch of space on all sides. A sketch-like image with good outlines and some shadowing is best for scrimshaw.

,, Cut it out, so that you can align it with the edges easily.

, Wet a cloth with acetone nail remover. Rub it lightly over the top of the paper with the cloth and then with a bone folder.


Make sure the paper is completely wet.

, You don’t want to move it around on the surface, or it will smudge your outline. Discard the paper.


If the outline didn’t come off onto the bone clearly, you can sand it, wax it and start again., Begin applying pressure while holding the pin as vertical as possible. Etch the lines into the surface of the bone., Then, apply some ink to the surface with a cotton swab. Apply a generous amount, and then wipe it off the remaining surface with a lint-free rag.

, You can also stipple, by etching dots. The closer the dots are together, the darker the shading will be.

, If you want a line to be darker, etch it deeper and apply more ink.

,, If you make a mistake, you can draw larger lines or you can sand the area, re-wax it and sketch it again.

,, Wax the surface of the scrimshaw when you are done by spreading an even layer over the artwork. It should appear shiny and preserve your ink.

Get to Know The Correct history of the Troll Doll.,
Search for the brand names.",How to Start Collecting Troll Dolls1," Like many other collectibles the Troll Doll has many different confusing niches. Original Troll Dolls were made in 1959 by a Danish woodcutter and fisherman named Thomas Dam as a Christmas gift for his daughter. They were Good Luck Trolls and the first ones were made of wooden bodies, glass doll eyes and sheep-hair wool for hair these are very high quality and hard to find. He also had a toy store named Dam Things. In the United States these were sold around Halloween 1963 to 1965. This was a huge toy fad during the time period. Norfin (R) Trolls was the name after The E.F.S. Marketing Associates brought the name. Troll dolls were always produced in Europe although the fad disappeared in United States until the 1980's then Hasbro got into the mix creating action figures like Teenage Mutant Ninja Trolls etc. These new dolls are made of plastic.
, If you aren't concerned about value go ahead buy the ones you want.  Dam and Norfin and Dam things are the trolls that are the most value though trolls that are animals or have two heads are very rare. Any type of Dam Things Lucky Troll is pretty rare as well. There's always a limited edition that is worth lots of money so do your research.

Inspect your dolls for damage and wear and tear. If the doll is more valuable with an uniform make sure that uniform is in tact and not too damaged. Make sure the eyes and other parts of the body on in good shape and the classic rainbow hair is not damaged. Avoid dolls covered with dirt, crayon, markers, sand or scuff marks. Make sure the wood in the originals is not rotten and the glass eyes are on the doll.

"
"
Shop around different kinds of stores to find the Troll Dolls.",How to Start Collecting Troll Dolls2," Since Troll Dolls are from the past, one of the only ways to find them is to go to a thrift shop, trade center or antique store. Another trend is some comic stores are starting to sell vintage tool figurines and there's also vintage stores that sell all 40s to 90s stuff Ebay is also a great source to find rare trolls and have a variety of options.

Be selective! Only go after the ones that really capture your heart instead of every model of a troll doll there is. Like all collecting this too can get addictive very quickly.

"
"
Don't just throw your Trolls in a box lumped together in a single compartment.,
Protect your Troll Dolls from harm in a plastic container away from moisture and sunlight.",How to Start Collecting Troll Dolls3," Their hair will get tangled and they'll bump and bruise each other. Thus making them look worn and rubbing off the facial figures., Get one with compartments like they use to keep rocks and minerals in. You can also display this easily on a wall in a shadow box.

In each compartment have notes about the specific trolls. In a binder and on disk keep the same notes in case the other notes get messed up. This inventory lists will make it easier to retrieve info rather for presenting them to friends or selling them.

"
"
Be selective with which Trolls you display.,
Keep your most prized possessions in a special doll case or display them in a shadow box.,
Preserve the original package and tags.",How to Start Collecting Troll Dolls4," Don't turn your room or home into a Troll museum. Rotate your collection and even change it up with the seasons or your mood. Let one or two Trolls speak for the entire collection. When someone asks for you to show them the rest you can show them., This really is only a deep box within a frame with a glass covering you can hang on a wall or set on a shelf

In a shadow box you can get really creative by adding a background and a fairy environment with small artificial plants and cute animal figurines. A spooky background can really set off a Wizard troll to great advantage.

, If you find one in it's original box, keep it in that original box or take the Troll out and keep the package in safe place. The original packaging will raise the retail value of the Troll inside and collectors go nuts over the original box."

Collect your stones in person or online.,
Find the stones that you’d like to polish.,
Scrape the stone with the point of a pocket knife.,
Shape the stone with a hammer and chisel.,
Clean all the dirt and debris off the stones.,
Choose the stone that you wish to polish first.,
Take the 60 grit sandpaper and rub it across the stone.,
Dip the stone in the water again.,
Take the 360 grit and continue rubbing your stone.,
Polish your stones with a tumbler.,
Apply a powdered polish onto a damp denim cloth.,
Polish your stone with a strip of leather.,
Apply a rouge to the polished stone.",How to Polish Stones," You can go out and find stones on your own; look for small (thumb-sized) rocks that are not gritty (sandstone is never a good choice), and also are not fractured or broken. Also avoid rocks with stones with lots of small pits on the surface, as these will not polish well.If this is your first time polishing stones, it may be challenging to find high-quality stones on your own. Try contacting a stone-collecting hobbyist groups in your area, and asking for their ideas about where to find stones to polish.
There are many websites that can advise you and help with stone-collecting locations, and also plenty of sites that sell rough, unpolished stones in bulk.;
, You will want to start with softer stones, as these are easier to shape and polish, and will take less time and work on your part. Softer stone types include: onyx, calcite, limestone, dolomite, or fluorite.Stones are ranked on hardness on the “Mohs hardness scale,” which ranks from 1 (very soft)–10 (very hard). Most of the stones listed above are a 3 or 4 on the Mohs scale.

, This will tell you if a stone is hard enough to be polished.If the scrape mark is gritty or white, the stone is too soft—you can still polish it, but its appearance will not improve.


If the stone is left with a metallic mark from the knife blade, it is hard enough to polish.
Be careful when using a pocket knife, and always scrape the stone with the blade moving away from your body. It doesn’t take much pressure to scrape the stone’s surface; start with light pressure on the knife, and only increase pressure as needed.

, Often stones are in awkward or unwieldy shapes; in order to shape the stone to a rounded, symmetrical point, use a hammer and chisel.Especially if you are planning to polish a larger stone, you may want to break off any large protrusions.


Since rock dust can be harmful to your lungs and eyes, it’s recommended that you wear safety glasses and an air mask while shaping your stones.Once you have chiseled the stone into the desired shape, grind any rough edges against a concrete surface to roughly smooth the edges.

, You can simply put all the rocks in a bucket of hot soapy water and let them soak for about 30 minutes. This will soften any dirt or material that have stuck onto the stone.


Once the stones have soaked, rinse them off.
It’s necessary to clean excess dirt from stones before you polish them; otherwise, you’ll clog up your sandpaper or tumbler with dirt and the stones won’t be polished.

, It’s recommended to pick the softest and smallest stone for the first time you practice polishing. A smaller, softer stone will be quicker and easier to polish.


Once you see the final results, it will entice you to continue with this hobby.

, This rough, course-grain sandpaper will not polish the stone at first, but it will allow you to shape the soft stone slightly.If you are going for a nice round stone, start at the corners and rub them down evenly. Once you have your stone shaped like you want, you’re ready to use a finer-grain sandpaper.


Periodically, dip the stone into your bucket of water to keep the stone wet.
60 grit, 160 grit, and 360 grit sandpaper will all be available from your local hardware store.

, Now use the 160 grit of paper and rub over the scratches the coarser paper left behind.You will notice that this grit of paper will still scratch the stone, but will smooth the larger scratches on the rock surface.


Remember to keep the stone wet; dip it in the bucket periodically. When all the larger scratches have been removed; proceed to the next step.

, As in the previous step, you want to smooth the stone even more.Each successively finer-grained sandpaper will sand out the large scratches from the larger-grain paper, and will leave smaller scratches on the stone.


Continue to rinse off the rock periodically. It’s important that the rock surface be damp when you are sanding it.
You will be finished once all scratches from the previous sanding have been smoothed over.

, If you don’t have the time or inclination to polish stones by hand, you can use a tumbler. A tumbler polishes stones by using the same principles; instead of sandpaper, you will need to add successively finer “tumbler grit” to the tumbler (while the rocks are in the barrel).Although using a tumbler takes much less physical work than polishing by hand, the process takes substantial amounts of time. You’ll tumble your stones three times (each with a successively finer grit), and each of these tumbling sessions takes about 7 days. The final polishing step takes 7 days as well.

, Start polishing the stone with the denim until you have achieved your desired result. A polish will remove all scratches left by the finest-grain sandpaper, and give the stone a shining lustre.You don’t have to put a lot of polish on the cloth; it’s best to start with a small amount of the polish (e.g. ½ teaspoon) and only add more polish if needed.
Powdered stone polish will likely be available at your local hardware store.Polishing powder is often used with dremel tools, so if you’re having trouble finding the powder, ask the sales staff if they stock dremels.
If not, you may need to go to a rock or gemstone hobby store to find the powder.
Be advised that colored polish will sometimes effect the color of the stone.

, This can be done after you use the denim and polishing powder, or done in its place. Leather will add a softer lustre to the stone, and also make the stone smooth and soft to the touch.


You can add polishing power onto the leather itself, for both a smoother and softer finished product., Rouges are typically used by jewelers to provide a finishing touch on fine jewelry, but they can be applied to polished stones as well. Apply the rouge to the denim cloth or leather strip that you used earlier, and then rub it into your polished stones.


Be advised that this step is optional. Rouges are often colored, and can stain the tone of your stone. If you apply a rouge, look for a color that already matches that of your stone.If you have trouble finding a rouge at your hardware store, check at a rock and gemstone hobby store. If that fails, try a jewelry store.

Try checking out auctions for rare and special toys.,
Conventions may also contain toys.,Of course, there's always Amazon and eBay for the toys you can't usually find in stores or have been discontinued.",How to Collect Toys," Thinking about the kind(s) of toys you want to collect make it easier to find out what you want to collect. Some kinds of toys could be red toys, yellow toys, animal toys, variety, cars, fluffy toys, etc.;
, Find some stores where you can buy toys. Look in big chain stores such as Walmart, Kmart, and Target, and also look at the independent or specialty stores to find more unusual items.


Thrift shops may also have some toys as well.

, If your friend or a family member has toys they don't want, ask them if they could give them to you.

, Sometimes garage sales sell toys. Look for local garage sales around your neighborhood. Check the local newspaper classified advertisements for yard, garage, or rummage sales near you.

, McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, and Dairy Queen are examples of fast food places that have special kid's meals that include a toy.

, Sometimes they can sell them for a limited time. A bookstore you can look at is Barnes and Noble.

Use specially designed comic book bags.,
Select a size.,
Bag each comic with a supportive board.,
Decide whether or not to tape your bag.",How to Preserve Your Comic Books1," Store your comics safely in a protective bag made from acid-free materials. Limit their exposure to moisture and dirt. Keep the pages as crisp and clean as possible.Expect most comic book bags to be made of one of either three materials: Mylar, polyethylene, and polypropylene.Save Mylar for your most cherished, expensive, or frail books, since Mylar is the thickest material and will offer the most protection.
Use polyethylene and polypropylene (the least expensive) for the rest of your collection.;
, Be aware that the average size of a comic book has changed over time. Expect older comics to be larger than today’s. Buy an appropriately sized bag for each comic to avoid the damage that might occur when you insert or remove it from a bag that is too small. Bag sizes are categorized by era:Golden Age (1940’s and earlier): 7 ¾ by 10 ½ inches, or 19.685 by 26.67 cm.

Silver Age (1950’s to 1980’s): 7 ⅛ by 10 ½ inches, or 18.1 by 26.67 cm.

Current Age: (1980’s to present): 6 ⅞ by 10 ½ inches, or 17.46 by 26.67 cm.

, First, slide your comic into its bag, spine first. As you do, gently press the comic closed to prevent the bottoms of the pages from scratching the edges of the bag’s opening.Once the entire comic is safely in the bag, slide a backing board in behind it.Give your comic a stiff, durable support to help keep its shape when stored upright.


Some backing boards are “buffered,” meaning that one side is smoother than the other. If yours is buffered, have the smoother side facing the comic inside the bag.Since acids can ruin your comic, make sure your backing board is acid-free. If you purchased a bagged comic with a backing board included, either confirm with the seller that the board is acid-free or replace it yourself to be 100% sure., Once you have bagged your comic, crease the bag’s flap to close it. Then decide between tucking the flap into the bag or taking the extra step of taping the flap to the outside of the bag (some bags may come with their own adhesive strips along their flaps). Be aware that there is some debate over which is best:


On the plus side, sealing the bag with tape will further reduce the chance of any outside elements coming into contact with the comic.However, when the bag is reopened, the sticky tape at the edge of the flap may come into contact with the comic when it is removed or reinserted, causing damage."
"
Store your comics in boxes.,
Stand them upright.,
Store your boxes safely.",How to Preserve Your Comic Books2," Protect them not only from moisture, but light as well, which will cause the pages to fade.Use a box that is specially designed for comic books, since a wider box may allow room for your upright comics to fall over sideways. Select between “long” and “short” boxes.Even if you plan on expanding your collection in the future, buy a box that is appropriately sized for your current collection. Storing 100 comics in a “long” box that fits 300 will allow room for your upright comics to fall forward.
With cardboard boxes, make sure that the cardboard is acid-free.
For the most protection from outside elements, use plastic boxes.

, Place each comic in the box vertically, as opposed to laying it flat on its back cover. Give yourself the ability to quickly search through titles without having to remove each and every comic first. Additionally, avoid the damage that may occur from stacking comics on top of each other.The combined weight of so many comics stacked on top of each other may press together the pages of those at the base, forming a seal, which will cause tears when you try to open them again.
Additionally, if the edges of the comics themselves are not lined up exactly with each other, the weight of those on top may cause the corners or edges of those below to bend and crease.

, Choose a storage space with consistent temperatures and humidity, since extreme changes in heat and moisture may hasten aging. Avoid placing them near sources of heat or cold, like radiators or a/c vents. Also avoid areas that are prone to leaks or flooding.To be extra cautious, shelve your boxes rather than set them directly on the floor, since moisture may still accumulate there, even without flooding.If you don't have adequate shelving, place your boxes on another raised surface, such as a pallet.Avoid stacking cardboard boxes if possible. If you must, keep your stacks to a maximum of five boxes each to prevent the ones on the bottom from being crushed under all that weight.
Label each box according to your organizational method.Rotate the one at the bottom of the stack to the top periodically so no one box bears the brunt of all that weight over the long run.
Ideal temperatures are between 50 and 70 degrees Fahrenheit (10 and 21 degrees Celsius). Humidity should ideally be around 35 percent, never more than 50 percent."
"
Allow them to reach room temperature.,
Stick to the shade.,
Wash and dry your hands.,
Avoid handling food, drink, and tobacco as you read.,
Hold them by their spines.,
Avoid repairing any damage.",How to Preserve Your Comic Books3," If your comics have been exposed to extreme cold or heat, expect the pages and/or spine to be brittle.Give them time to warm up or cool down, as needed, before reading. This will reduce the chance of tearing the pages or cracking the spines when you open them.

, Never read your comics under a direct source of light. Prevent the pages from fading by keeping them out of the sun.When indoors, only read them by covered lamps., Remove any dirt or grime that may blemish the pages. Dry your hands thoroughly to prevent water damage. Even then, be aware that your skin’s natural oils may smear the pages. Do not pinch the pages between your fingers., Don’t set yourself up for disaster. Refrain from eating, drinking, and smoking while reading. Eliminate the risk of smudging your pages with chocolate, spilling coffee over them, or turning them yellow and stinking them up thanks to smoke., Lay the spine flat along your open hand. Open the book just enough so you can read what is inside. Avoid clutching the book by its covers, which may crease the comic., If you are concerned about maintaining the value of your book for resale purposes, accept what damages have already occurred. Do not use tape or glue to fix tears or weak spines, since these will be regarded as further blemishes on top of the natural wear-and-tear.However, if you have no intention of ever reselling it and instead want to ensure that it holds up for multiple rereadings, go right ahead.

Find a comic book store.,
Locate other major sources.,
Consider a mainstream superhero comic.,
Try out a different genre.,
Dive into the bargain bin.,
Start with the beginning of a story arc.,
Collect comics in the same series or story arc.,
Follow a character or universe.",How to Start a Comic Book Collection1," A dedicated comics store is the best place to start a collection, since there will be a large selection available, and store employees that can give you advice. Use this worldwide comic shop locator to find one nearby.;
, If there is no comic book store in your area, try to find another area with a sizable collection. Libraries won't let you build your collection, but they can be a good place to find out which comics you enjoy before spending any money. Book stores, especially ones that sell used books, often have good starter material as well.


As a last resort, you can try the magazine sections of gas stations and grocery stores, but the selection will typically be poor or nonexistent.

, If you are interested in trying out superhero comics, you might want to start with one of the DC or Marvel characters that you're already familiar with from popular culture.



Spiderman is a good introduction to the genre, while Batman is another extremely popular comic with darker themes.
For plenty of humor and action, try Captain America or Thor.
For a more complex approach, follow the large hero team X-Men, or read about the antihero Deadpool for his fourth-wall-breaking gallows humor.

, There are many other genres of comic books, but the selection may vary from store to store. Ask advice from a comic-reading friend or a comic store employee, or follow the suggestions below:


The graphic novels Watchmen and V for Vendetta, along with the Sandman series, are popular examples of comics that address more adult, intellectual themes using superhero tropes.
Japanese manga includes many sub-genres. Try this introductory guide.
Browse the store's independent publisher section or graphic novel selection to find a wide array of artistic and writing styles.

, If you truly can't decide where to begin, find the bargain bin and start buying stacks of comics for a dollar or less each. You probably won't find popular or valuable comics this way, but you may find hidden gems that spark your interest in a series.

, There's no need to start with issue 1 if the series has been going on for years. Typically, a story arch lasts for roughly 10–20 issues, and introduces you to several comics and characters. Not all story arcs are easy for beginners to jump into, so asking a store employee or comic-reading friend for advice is the best way to find a good starting point.

, Once you've found a comic book you like, there are a couple natural ways to progress your collection. A comic book series is defined by the name on the cover. If you like The New Avengers issue 25, chances are you'll also enjoy other The New Avengers issues as well. To catch a glimpse at a larger story involving characters you might not be aware of, read a story arc instead. These are ""crossover events"" that involve more than one series. These can vary widely in how many series are involved and how long they last. Here are two extreme examples to show the range, one of a very short story arc to track down and one that could be a significant collection challenge on its own:


The New Avengers/Transformers story arc lasted only four issues, and was published as a separate, temporary series involving only characters from those two franchises.
The Batman: Knightfall story arc took over a year to complete, and was published in staggered order throughout the series Batman, Detective Comics, Shadow of the Bat, and several other Batman-related comics., The most popular comic book characters are major protagonists in several series running at the same time, and typically exist in the same ""universe"" as other characters and comic book series. For example, if you're a fan of Wonder Woman, she's recently starred in the series Wonder Woman, Justice League, Superman/Wonder Woman, Smallville, and Injustice: Gods Among Us.To learn more about the world and other characters in it, you can read many more comics set in the DC universe, such as the many series that involve Batman, Superman, The Green Lantern, and others.


The largest comic book universes can be complicated, as most of them have been relaunched several times with changed features. Sometimes, the same character may exist side by side in different, but similar universes, or a ""What if?"" issue may show a hypothetical story that doesn't have an impact on other comics.

Take it slowly.,
Notice the names of writers and artists.,
Decide what form to buy comics in.,
Hunt for comics in obscure places.,
Befriend other collectors.,
Attend comic book conventions.,
Look for individual comics online.,
Know the quality grading system.,
Search for landmark issues.",How to Start a Comic Book Collection2," Try to pace yourself, and start by purchasing comic books in just one or two series at a time. Decide on a monthly budget and focus on your favorite comics, or you may find yourself running out of money and storage space long before you have the collection you're looking for.

, As you read your first few comic book stories, you'll be exposed to several writers and many art styles. When you find a favorite, turn back to the beginning of the issue and write down the author or artist name. Track down other issues written or illustrated by the same person to expose yourself to stories you wouldn't normally find.


Neil Gaiman, Alan Moore, Bill Willingham, Warren Ellis, and Mark Millar are all well-known comic authors.

, Most mainstream comic books are first released in short installments called issues, about 10–20 pages long. If you are willing to wait, you can often save money by purchasing a trade paperback containing five or so issues in one volume, or a graphic novel containing a complete story arc. Paperbacks and graphic novels are also easier to store than single issues, if you already have a bookshelf.


Some independent artists only publish as a graphic novel.
You may also check the inside cover of a comic book for subscription information, and sign up to receive the comic in the mail.

, Once you have started a comic collection, you may enjoy hunting for older or less popular comics. Visit flea markets, garage sales, thrift stores, and antique shops to see what's available.

, Meet other comic book collectors browsing shelves at the comic book store. Trade comic books with them, or loan and borrow books so you can read a comic before deciding whether to purchase it for your collection.

, There are many comic book conventions that draw thousands of fans to meet the people who create comics, find deals on new or rare comics, or hear announcements about upcoming comics. The most famous is Comic-Con, held in San Diego each year.

, Search on Amazon, eBay, and other retail sites for specific comics that will round out your collection of a series. Always look up the seller's ratings and reviews before purchasing, and search for past sales of the same issue to tell whether you are getting a good deal.


If you cannot find past sales history on an item, try looking up the comic's price at ComicsPriceGuide.

, Individual comic books are graded for quality to describe the condition the comic has been preserved in. A rating of 0.5 (Poor) means there are pages or part of the cover missing, or that the comic has been heavily damaged by spilled substances. A rating of 10.0 (Gem Mint) means the comic is in perfect condition, with no blemishes. Comic books with a higher quality grade are much more valuable.

, The truly valuable comics can be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars, and form the centerpiece of a collection. While older comics are worth more in general, the most valuable ones involve a landmark event in a popular series. Here are a few types of landmark events (along with examples from The Amazing Spiderman):


The first issue of the series (e.g. The Amazing Spiderman issue 1).
The first appearance of a major character (e.g. The Green Goblin in issue 14).
The death of a major character (e.g. issue 121).
The first appearance of a popular object or new look (e.g. the symbiote suit in issue 252).

, Store your comics in a dry area at room temperature. Keep them away from direct sunlight. If they are kept in a storage area instead of on the shelf, keep them in plastic bags to minimize water damage.

, Keep issues from the same series together, and order them by issue number. Use folder dividers to separate series kept on the same shelf or in the same container.

, Purchase plastic slips to further protect your most valuable issues. Keep these in a secure place in a designated area of your comic collection, so you can easily locate them. When handling them, wear latex gloves to prevent leaving traces of skin oil on the pages.

Ask yourself how you want to see your collection.,
Categorize.,
Invest in accessories.,
Mix and match.,
Be creative!,
Track your collection.",How to Organize a Collection," If you want to display your collection you will want to have some form of presentation to avoid just lining things up in a row (though sometimes that's the best way to go).


Do you want you collection to look creative or do you just want it to be displayed for the purpose of organization?
If you are collecting figurines, do you want your characters to be in action poses and dioramas, or do you want them in categorized rows?;
, If you want everything to be neat, you can organize your collection into categories. For example, you can display your state coin collection by year they came out. This will give your collection a cool ""museum-like"" look. If you have action figures, you can recreate scenes from the appropriate TV show or movie. Make sure you have appropriate boundaries between scenes to avoid making your collection look like a jumbled mess.

, Consider putting some funds into:


Display stands. For collections with large objects, (figurines, porcelain, models) use stands and risers to provide more space and provide a better look.
Shelves. For any collection, shelves can be used if cabinet, table or desk space is not available. These also help elevate your collection to eye level making them easier to look at.
Card/coin books. If displaying your collection to yourself and not outsiders your goal, you should consider buying coin or card books with plastic pockets to protect and cleanly display your collection.
Tables, desks and cabinets. These will be your main form of displaying along with shelves. Tables and desk provide plenty of space to lay out comics, create dioramas, place model trains etc.

, To create more presentation and to make it look like you have a lot more items, mix and match the items in your collection. Don't just keep your posters in one place and your comics in another. Create tribute shelves to your favorite football player or line up three rare comics behind a cool-looking Spider-Man figure. Be creative in doing this, you can add collectible stickers or other odd-ball items around your centerpiece on a shelf to add background.

, If none of the above works, you can find other ways of putting shelves and tables to fit your collection. Consider devoting an entire room or wall to your collection so you have some idea of the amount of space you have. Look at other peoples collections to get inspired.

, Keeping a list of what you have and what you want is a great way to ensure that you don't accidentally buy duplicates or forget about the items that you'd love to have. The most basic way to track your collection is with software like Microsoft Word or Excel. Depending on what you collect, though, there are websites that might cater to your specific tastes."

Sort coins according to denomination types.,
Examine the façade of the coin and its inscriptions, it is important to focus on the lettering and look for anything unusual or odd.,
Focus also on the mint-mark and the date indicated on coins, this is considered one of the greatest finds in errors in coins.,
Check major details on both face sides of the coin like portraits, structures, and the like.,
Systematically and slowly inspect the coin turning it from the top to the bottom not from one side to another.,
Don’t miss out on the edges of coins, using your palm roll the coin in order to have the chance to inspect all of the edges.,
Always set aside coins that give you even a little suspicion, if one is busy but spots or suspects that there is something odd with a certain coin set it aside for further inspection later.",How to Find Error Coins," It’s always advised to examine them by categories such as grouping them accordingly like dimes, nickels, pennies, etc. This will certainly make the work easier, quickly observing some differences of a coin to another if you evaluate them by groups. It is important not to get too hyped in the search, remember that if an error is too small then the value of the coin is not too much.;
, Look out for missing letters, any doubling, and anything out of the usual. Error coins get these abnormalities during the production process; usually dirt affects the polishing and stamping process resulting to coins different from the others. Look at the face of the coin on both sides in different angles to easily see errors.

, Finding errors like details with over-punches, re-punches and other doubling errors makes such coins valuable.

, Doubling may also occur and try to find cracks, blank areas and other missing elements. On portraits, check on the details like chin, mouth, ears and eyes, doubling often also occur on these areas. Rim of coins should also be inspected where abnormalities also sometimes occur.

, If the orientation of the coin is on the right side up at starting point, the orientation after the turn should also be on the right side up. If orientation changes, then the coin is considered valuable. The government takes great care when it comes to correct orientation to prevent error coins reaching circulation. This is why you should make it a habit to check orientation of coins every time you hold one with the simple over-the-top-turn technique.

, Look for missing reeds, seams, inconsistencies on lines, and other abnormalities. Don’t forget to check on edges that have lettering because doubling may also occur.

, Finding valuable coins becomes easier and faster in time because the eye gets used to spotting small errors with practice.

Ask your friends.,
Ask people around your school.,
Ask people to give you Silly Bandz they hate.,
Once you have one band, trade it!,
If one of your friends forgets to bring their lunch one day, offer them your sandwich in exchange for a silly band!

,
Offer to help someone with their homework for a few Silly Bandz!

,
'Forget' a ponytail holder one day and ask your friends if they'll give you a Silly Band so you can put your hair up.,
Annoy someone a lot and then tell them that if they give you a Silly Band, you'll go away.

",How to Convince People to Give You Their Silly Bandz," If they're your friends, they'll usually give you at least one just for fun. Ask around your big collectors especially, since the people who have hundreds of them certainly shouldn't mind handing over one or two.;
, If you see someone (even if you're not really friends with them) giving away Silly Bandz to people, don't be afraid to ask, ""Can I have one too, please?"" If they say no, that's okay. Sometimes people will say yes!

, For most people, there's at least 1 Silly Band in the pack that's just ugly to them. If there is, ask for it! Sometimes they'll give you all 3 designs of that ugly band!

, Sometimes people will want a band so badly, they'll give you 2 of their bands for it!

,,, Your friends will do this for you, and then you can keep it!

Tune the radio to highest band on the AM setting.,
Assemble the search head.,
Tape your devices into the position.,
Attach your search head to a shaft.,
Test your metal detector on some household metals.",How to Build a Metal Detector1," Make sure you are not tuned to a station. You should hear the static tone clearly and steadily. This will allow you to hear any differences in the tone when your device detects a metal object., Turn on your calculator. Next, position the two devices back-to-back, until a steady, dull tone is emitted. You may have to arrange the devices at certain angles or distances to achieve this tone., Once the calculator and radio are producing the correct tone, you need to tape them in that position. If the distance is too awkward to tape your devices together, mount them in that position on a board. This will keep your search head sturdy and functioning properly as you search for metals., An old broomstick or similar pole will make a suitable shaft. Use duct tape as a quick and secure method to mount the shaft. Alternatively, you can use zip ties to fasten the two pieces together. Use whichever method works best for the shape of your search head.., First, prove that the metal detector works by placing a spoon on the table. Run the detector over the spoon and listen for the detector to beep or give off a new sound (different from the steady tone that it is producing). Now, you can take it outside or around your house to locate other metal objects.

"
"
Download a metal detector app.,
Pass your phone over metals with the app open.,
Watch the measured magnetic field change.",How to Build a Metal Detector2," Smartphones are electrical devices, and as such they produce a magnetic field. There have been applications developed that allow you to use the phone’s own magnetic field to detect metal objects. Go to your respective app store (this differs from platform to platform) and download metal detector app.One example of a metal detector app is the app “Metal Detector.”

, Once the app has downloaded, open it. Follow any setup instructions within the app so that it works optimally. When the app is loaded and ready, start passing your phone over different metal objects., The metal detector apps work by measuring changes in the magnetic field of your phone. As you pass over metal, it interacts with this field and the app detects that interaction. These interactions show as fluctuations in the magnetic field as you move from object to object.For example, as you pass over a metal object, the magnitude of the field may increase dramatically. This indicates that you have found something metal.

"
"
Assemble the hardware.,
Solder the circuits.,
Test the metal detector.",How to Build a Metal Detector3," You can buy metal detector kids that come with various pieces of hardware. Some will include a coil and shaft. Others will only include a control box. Choose the kit that is right for you and assemble the pieces per the instructions.If you choose a kit with less hardware, you will have to make the additional pieces such as the shaft and coil.

, The control box will require soldering to complete all of the necessary circuits. You will need a soldering gun or iron to solder the components. If you have never soldered before, you should consider having a more experienced person help. , Once you have assembled your metal detector, you should test it. Put down different metals on the floor and pass the coil over them. If the coil detects the metals, then you are ready to take your new metal detector out and start looking for treasures."

Decide the limitations of your unicorn collection.,
Collect small unicorn items.,
Collect wall unicorn items.,
Collect toy unicorns.,
Collect items of clothing with unicorn designs.,
Collect unicorn jewellery.,
Collect outdoor unicorns.,
Collect books and comics about unicorns.,
Collect unicorn cards, stationery and prints.,
Collect unicorn novelty items.,
Collect unicorn craft patterns.,
Collect unicorn branding.,
Collect online unicorn videos.",How to Collect Unicorns," If you live in a small apartment, garden sized unicorns are out for you. Consider the living arrangements available for your collection. You may be able to spare a cabinet, a shelf, a wall space or a back yard. Just be sure you keep this in mind when you start collecting and buying unicorn items. If you have a lot of space, you're not limited and can roam far and wide but you should still be aware of care, maintenance and security issues, especially if you choose to purchase unicorn outdoor sculptures.;
, Small items would be suitable for such areas as a shelf, a cabinet or the top of items such as window sills, older style TV sets and over doorways. The types of things you might consider include:


Figurines
Statues
Small portrait sized pictures
Carvings
Plates, bowls, pin dishes

, The types of items that can go on a wall are tremendously varied and include banners, pennants, flags, blankets, illustrations, posters, paintings, calendar cut outs that you can frame etc.

, Toy unicorns are everywhere, from Japan to the USA. They can make for a fantastic unicorn collection provided you have the space - or the patience to remove them off your bed every night and put them back again.

, This is a ""wearable"" collection, to let people know that you really dig the unicorn.

, There is a vast array of unicorn jewellery out there, including rings, necklaces, bracelets, toe rings, anklets and more.

, Outdoor unicorns include sculptures, garden features such as this willow unicorn, fountains, mobiles, wind chimes. You might also consider feature pieces, such as a metallic gate with a unicorn design or a stained glass window featuring a unicorn.

, This might be the easiest and most satisfying if you don't have a lot of room and you'd like to learn more about unicorns.

, There are many birthday and other cards that feature unicorns, as well as small prints of unicorns. Some stationery also features unicorns on notebooks, pencils, erasers etc.

, Fairs, shows and theme parks are the best bets for these items. Pinata unicorns are also a great collectible item.

, There are many patterns for unicorns in such crafts as cross-stitch, filet crochet, paint-by-number, knitting, felt toy making, tapestry, leadlighting etc.

, Brand names that feature unicorns range from chocolate, cigarette packages, general food items, toy boxes, right up to large items such as cars. If you choose to collect unicorns, it will help to do some online research first. Keep an eye out for such items on your travels. And don't forget to look for official government documentation in countries such as Britain, where the unicorn is an official symbol. Look for pamphlets, forms, badges etc.

, Choose an online video site and begin collecting your favourite unicorn videos. Be careful though - some videos feature violent unicorns. Whilst funny or scary, these are not exactly in keeping with the traditional idea of the unicorn and may not fit with your idea of unicorns.

Determine how you will contain the pieces of your broken rock.,
If using a bag, put your rocks into the bag.,
Make sure you have your safety goggles on and that they are secure.

,
Figure out about how much force you will need to break up the rock.,
Start hitting your object rock (or rocks).,
Consider wearing long sleeves and pants.,
Lay down the steel (or hard surface) that you are going to use.,
Separate the rocks that are the right size if you need to continue breaking up the rock.,
Finish up what you wanted to do with them.",How to Break Smaller Rocks Safely," Some suggestions are:


A denim bag (You could make one from an old pair of jeans)
A box (Could be somewhat awkward)
A corner;
, Be sure not to overcrowd the bag. If using the other methods, the same applies.


Be sure that if you put multiple rocks into the bag that you want the rocks to be all the same hardness. In other words, don't mix up the type of rocks.

,, Is your rock chalk, granite, obsidian? If it's too soft and you hit it very hard, you will turn it into dust. If it is very hard, and you barely hit it, you will, if you're lucky, chip it and that's it.

, Break them until they are the size (or sizes) that you want, depending upon your end objective.

, This isn't required, but you should do it in case any spare shard gets loose.

, Or go to the location that that particular surface is at.

, That way, they won't be too small.

, Rock tumbling is one way of learning about the beauty that can be found in rocks.

Buy or check out books on collecting antique advertisements.,
Decide upon the style of vintage advertising items you would like to collect.,
Do online research.,
Get an account on CollectorsWeekly.com.,
Attend a print and paper fair.,
Attend flea markets.,
Visit pawn shops, estate sales and second hand shops.,
Search auction houses.,
Place a classified ad in a local paper or magazine asking for old magazines, posters, postcards or other items.,
Befriend a paper or ephemera seller.,
Keep excellent records of each item you buy.,
Go online to Posters.com or Art.com if you want vintage advertisement style, but do not want to do research or pay a lot of money.,
Sell your merchandise.",How to Collect Vintage Advertising Items," Before you start looking for items, you should know their value and what is considered rare. Unless you are simply collecting to decorate a room, the amount of research you do is likely to correlate with the value of your collection later on.


Go to collectics.com/bookstore_advertising.html to find lists of books on antique advertisements. Advertising memorabilia covers commonly collected items, such as Coca-Cola, match books, gas station signs and more.
Start with books by B.J. Summers, such as ""Antique & Contemporary Advertising Memorabilia"" and ""Value Guide to Advertising Memorabilia."" Other good choice include ""Old Magazine Advertisements 1890-1950: Identification & Value Guide"" by Richard E. Clear and ""Kovels' Advertising Collectibles Price List"" by Terry Kovel.;
, Since you can collect anything from posters, to lunch boxes to bottles or cans, it is a good idea to specialize in 1 or 2 items, learn the industry and then move into other items in the future.

, Visit online sellers, such as vintageseekers.com and peruse their inventory of vintage posters. They command high prices, but you will get a good idea of the most valuable items.

, This site brings together information on collecting vintage advertising items and it also lists the eBay auctions of advertising items for the week.

You can sign up for a weekly email from the advertising section of Collector's Weekly.

, Use your new knowledge at these 1 to 3 day events that are held annually across the country. At fairs like the San Francisco Antiquarian Book, Print and Paper Fair, vintage paper sellers congregate from around the region and the country to sell to collectors.

, Look for sellers who specialize in post cards, posters and other prints and ephemera. You will be able to barter for some items in this setting, so be confident if you see a good value.

, Many sellers amass a large quantity of tin cans, beer mugs, posters and clothing made for advertising. Barter with these sellers for a reduction in prices.

, EBay and Morphy Auctions are just two of the auction sites that regularly deal in antique advertisements. Their holdings change daily and weekly, so check back often to make bids and peruse merchandise.


You will be required to set up an account in order to make bids on a lot of auction items. As well as your personal information and email, you will also need to provide a bank account number or credit card.

, Offer to buy them by the piece or pound if you believe there may be some valuable items. Many people are happy to get rid of their old stacks of magazines for a small price.

, Some book and paper sellers keep a list of their collectors and go to them when they find new items. Give the seller a list of items you are interested in purchasing.

, Catalog the items, take pictures and list their worth. You may want to insure some of your items in case of damage or theft.

, Many antique advertisements have been reproduced into posters that sell for $10 to $50.

, As you become more of an expert, you may want to sell things that you are not sentimental or valuable to you on eBay or to vintage paper sellers. Selling certain items will allow you to expand your advertising collection with more sophisticated purchases.

Remove the country collectables that you have stowed away in the bottom of the cupboard.,
Find space for display.,
Use disguises.,
Display with visual interest in mind.,
Keep within a theme.,
Make good use of country theme elements to offset your collection.",How to Display Country Collectables," They're not doing anyone any good in there. Go through them and discard anything that doesn't please you; the local charity shop will gladly take such things. For the remaining items, see if you can group them into themes, or rooms where you would like them displayed.;
, Ideal places for displaying country collectables include:


Shelves - in kitchen cabinets, on walls, over the TV, in purpose-built display units, on window ledges, etc. Make use of unused space too - if you have a fireplace that is no longer used, for example, convert it into extra shelf space for your collectables. This is a great spot because it is out of the way and not easily bumped into.
On the walls - hang pictures, cloth hangings, small items etc. on the wall, above doors and windows etc.
On small tables - small side tables make a great place to put country collectables
On beds - practical country collectables such as quilts look great on the bed; remove at night if you don't actually wish to use them. Also consider hanging lace or linen from the railings of four-poster beds and adding doilies etc. to cushions upon the beds

, The beauty of country collectables is that they can be items that disguise blemishes. If you have a table or chair with a stain, use a doily to cover the stain, or maybe a quilt or other cloth. Use wooden boxes, hat boxes and dolls to also sit on things that are otherwise bland or ugly to look at.

, Try to mix the items that you have on display so that there are height differences between the objects. Visual interest will be created by placing larger things at the back, medium things in the middle and the smaller things at the front of shelves and display units. Put heavy and large things at the base of your shelves or under chairs that are against a wall etc.

, If you put similar themes together, or similar colours, your display will have greater impact. Typical country collectable colours include greens, dusky pinks, reds, blues, browns, creams and yellows. Some typical country themes include: kitchen, dolls, toys, baking items, jewellery, vintage sewing, teapots, old photos, quilts, farm animals, crinoline ladies, lace, angels and cherubs, baby dresses, doilies, knitting paraphernalia, sewing machines, Clarice Cliff china, 1800s - 1930s magazines, antique bags, hatboxes, vases, patriotic memorabilia etc.

, Use baskets, rugs, blankets, quilt ladders, leadlight cabinets, quilt hanging accessories, rocking horses, tapestries and embroideries, iron door stoppers, etc. to maintain the theme.

Visit online stores that sell toys.,
Look on major auction or trading sites.,
Check out trade or swap sites run by collectors or fans.,
Check out freebie sites.,
Check toy stores that are more out of the way or ""stuck in time"".,
Check thrift, charity or opportunity stores.,
Check secondhand or antique stores.,
Check out wholesalers that sell discontinued stock.,
Check out which auction houses deal with toys.,
Visit toy auctions.,
Check out storage auctions or liquidation auctions.",How to Find a Toy That Is No Longer in Stores," Some online retailers may retain older stocks of toys or will know how to source them for you. Check out stores that specialize in online toy sales, and more specifically, that have a focus on discontinued toy lines, to see what they have on offer. It is also a good idea to check out stores that carry used toys in good condition.


You can use a site such as Flipkart or Andromeda.;
, There are quite a few of these around the world, and there is a big possibility that someone, somewhere is selling that toy you're after. The trick is to not look just in your own backyard, but to search worldwide. Some auction sites are international, while some are country-specific. This means that while you'll likely have no problems finding things on the international sites, be sure to also check sites available in the countries where the item was originally manufactured, especially if this is not China.


Some sellers specialize in selling discontinued or hard-to-find toys through sites such as eBay and Etsy.

, Such sites may have forums, trading places and other ways to connect with fellow fans or collectors of the toy you're after. Be prepared to either pay a fair price, plus shipping, or to give something of equal value in exchange.

, Sites that allow giveaways, such as Freecycle, are great places to check for old toys. Join up, then browse through the lists of freebies available in your area. If nothing is showing up that is relevant, place a ""Wanted"" request and wait. Someone may just have the toy you're after.

, These are the stores in out of way places, such as the countryside or a suburb with mostly elderly residents. They may still carry stocks long exhausted in the larger urban areas. Do a phone around of such stores, including country or rural toy stores to see whether they have old stock not yet sold. You can even extend this search to stores in other countries, where the toy may not have sold out as quickly or have been as popular as your own country.

, The item will likely be used but in many cases, you can often find old toys in good condition. In lucky cases, the item might even still be in its box, unused. However, this is a very ""hit and miss"" method, so you'll need to have a good eye for sifting through junk boxes and prepare to be disappointed a lot of the time.

, If the stores stock toys, there is a chance that your toy might be there, especially if it's a collectible. To save time, it can be easier to call the store first. If it turns out that they stock the items, head on down to check out their supplies; if not, keeping phoning around.

, If they deal in toys, it is possible that they might have your toy if it was discontinued in recent years.

, They might have online catalogs or it might be easier to call and ask if they have the toy coming up for auction and whether they know of a collector who might be willing to sell one.

, These are fun, so you can plan to go to one just to enjoy it. It might be a good opportunity to find that old toy. In many cases, there is a premium placed on the condition of the toy, including coming with its original box or packaging, so if that's what you're after, toy auctions are a great choice.

, Sometimes old toys get caught up in storage places or become part of liquidated assets of failed businesses. This is a long shot, as it requires turning up to all sorts of auctions that don't identify the stock necessarily, but if you like rummaging and think auctions are fun, you just never know what might turn up. If toys are mentioned, it might be worth going; even if all you get is something cool to trade with.

Take a small Sledgehammer or a rock hammer (preferably not a construction hammer, such as a claw hammer) and strike the top center of the geode.",How to Crack Open a Geode2,";
, A couple of strikes might be required to fully crack open this rock. This is likely to result in the geode fragmenting into more than two pieces, but it is the most suitable method for kids, though not recommended for particularly valuable/rare geodes."
"
Take a rock or masonry flat chisel, hold at top center of rock, then strike with a hand-held sledge hammer.,
Rotate rock a bit, then strike again to create a line around the circumference of the stone.

,
Repeat, as necessary, until the rock splits open.",How to Crack Open a Geode3," Tap lightly, as to score the rock only.

,, Patience is key; if the geode is hollow, it will probably take a few minutes of gentle scoring to open it, but if the geode is solid, it'll take longer."

Prepare your equipment.,
Place the sample in a crucible.,
Combine any additives.,
Heat the reaction to completion.,
Pour off the top layer.,
Cool the metal.,
Cupel the metal.,
Dissolve the silver.,
Wash the gold.,
Weigh the gold.",How to Assay Gold1," You will need a crucible to put the sample into. You will need a heat source such as a torch or furnace to bring the sample to high temperatures. You will also need other reactants such as the additives to create the flux, the bone ash to cupel the metal, and some sodium nitrate to extract residual silver. You will also need molds to pour hot metal into.


Also wear goggles, heat resistant gloves, and ideally a fireproof suit.;
, The crucible needs to be able to withstand high temperatures. The sample will be exposed to enough heat to melt all of the metals and separate them from other minerals. Clay or ceramic crucibles can withstand tremendous heat., Additives such as lead oxide, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, and flour are used to form a flux. The flux reacts with the same (or ore) to promote melting. Different ratios of each additive will produce slightly different flux compounds., The flux reaction needs to be heated to completion. When the reaction is complete, you will see two separate layers. Depending on the laboratory and the additives used, you will typically heat to between 1,100 and 1,200 degrees Celsius (2,012 - 2,192 degrees Fahrenheit). The top layer is molten glass that contains no valuable minerals. The bottom layer contains your molten precious metals., Carefully discard the top layer of molten glass. It will be of no further use in the assay. No gold, silver, or other metal will be lost by doing this.Be careful not to pour off any of the metal layer.

, Pour the metal into a mold. In the mold, the metal can cool until it once again reaches a solid state. This metal is now comprised of gold, silver, and lead.Be very careful, as the metal will be hot for a long period of time and can severely burn you.

, A cupel is a porous container made of bone ash that will readily absorb lead oxide. To cupel the metal, you place it in the cupel and blast it with hot air. This will oxidize the lead. The lead oxide will then vaporize or be absorbed by the bone ash. After cupling, you will have a metal sample that is composed of gold and silver., Submerge the metal in nitric acid. The acid will not dissolve the gold, but it will dissolve the silver. You can then pour the solution through a filter to separate the gold., Wash the gold with water to remove any excess nitric acid. Pat the gold dry with a soft towel. At this point, you should have a sample that is nearly pure gold., With all contaminants removed, you can weigh your gold on a scale. By comparing the weight of the gold to the weight of the original sample, you can determine the percent weight of gold in your ore or scrap. This completes the fire assay of the gold piece."

Assemble the items needed.,
Mix the salt, glue, and colored sugar in the small bowl.,
When the salt has formed a dough-like consistency, scoop it onto the wax paper.

,
(If you want to use a rock on jewelery, stick a toothpick inside it before leaving it to set.,
Wait for 12 hours or more, or until hardens.",How to Make Colored Salt Rocks," These are listed below under ""Things You'll Need"".
, Mix well until it becomes soft and jellylike.

,,


At this stage, while the salt ""dough"" is still malleable, you can mold the salt rock into shapes such as gems, animal shapes, items for adding to hair accessories or pendants, etc. Mold as wished and leave on the wax paper to dry.

, It's best left in a warm, dry place overnight.


Once hardened, use to make craft items, jewelry or anything else such as game pieces or fake gems for cosplay, fancy dress and role playing.

Gather the needed reagents.,
Mix acids to form aqua regia.,
Dissolve the sample.,
Filter the sample.,
Remove nitric acid.,
Precipitate the gold.,
Collect and weigh the gold.",How to Assay Gold2," You will need hydrochloric and nitric acids. You will also need a filter to filter out contaminants. Finally you are going to need an oxidizing reagent.


Wear goggles and gloves when working with this method.

, Aqua regia is Latin for “royal water.” This solution is used to remove gold from a scrap of metal or an ore. To make it, mix one part hydrochloric acid and three parts nitric acid.For example, 400 mL of aqua regia will contain 100 mL of hydrochloric acid and 300 mL of nitric acid.
Use gloves, goggles, and caution when making and using aqua regia. It is highly corrosive and toxic.
Aqua regia cannot be stored well. A new batch must be made for each use.

, Submerge the metal sample in aqua regia. Stir and swirl to dissolve the sample. Non-metal minerals may not dissolve. These minerals will form a sludge.

, Pour the sludge solution through a filter. The sludge will remain on one side of the filter and the aqua regia solution containing the metals will pass through to the other side. The solution is usually greenish in color and will contain many dissolved metals such as gold, silver, and copper., The nitric acid must be removed before the gold can be taken out of solution. You can do this by boiling the solution. Do not breath in the fumes.Do this outside or under a fume hood.

, The gold must be forced out of solution. To do this, you must use a reducing agent. Oxalic acid is commonly used for this. After precipitating, the gold will a solid that sinks to the bottom of the solution., Strain the gold from the aqua regia solution and dry it. Weigh the gold on a scale. The weight of the gold can be compared to the weight of the original sample to determine the ratio of gold to other metals and minerals."
"
Collect a sample.,
Analyze the sample.,
Understand the results.",How to Assay Gold3," Samples can be collected from the field or purchased. Alternatively, any jewelry or scraps of metal can also be analyzed. The sample will not be harmed by the spectrometer., Little preparation is needed to analyze a sample with ED-XRF spectrometry. The results are extremely accurate and cost very little compared to other methods. The spectrometer can examine samples that are solid, liquid, or powdered., ED-XRF spectrometry is short for Energy Dispersive - X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry. This technology identifies elements and compounds by the way that they disperse light. Results will show the percent composition of gold in your sample. From that, you can determine how much gold is present given the weight of the sample.For example, if you had a piece of jewelry that was 100 grams and had a 70% gold composition, the piece would contain 70 grams of gold.

Understand how errors happen.,
Understand the rationale behind valuing stamps with flaws.,
Understand the difference between constant and ephemeral errors.,
Look for an inverted center image.,
Look for overprinting errors.,
Watch for intentional errors.",How to Spot Errors That Add Value to Stamps," They can occur at any and all stages of stamp production. Design errors, errors from using the wrong paper, colour errors, inverted center errors and perforation errors are only some of the kinds of errors that are known.;
, Errors are often discovered quickly, even before the stamp leaves the printing plant, but some may remain unnoticed for many years. Some are quickly corrected, or the stamp is completely withdrawn from circulation. Other errors affect only one stamp in a large sheet. These result in a relative scarcity of the stamp compared to its normal counterpart. Occasionally both the flawed stamp the normal version are still produced in large quantities to prevent speculation.

, Many old stamps have been extensively studied by specialists, who have found numerous differences that allow a person to determine the exact position of the stamp on the printed sheet. ""Flyspecks"" because of dust on the printing plates, or ""donuts"" because of an air bubble on an offset printing plate are not as valuable as more dramatic errors or errors that were constant throughout the stamp's print run.

, Some stamps used to require a second or third manual feed through the printing press after changing the ink in the press. When the sheet was accidentally fed upside-down for its second passage through the press, an inverted centre would result. A very famous example of this type error is the 24 cent United States airmail stamp of 1918, the ""Inverted Jenny"", which shows the airplane upside down. Only one sheet of this stamp is known to have escaped into the public. Because the position of each stamp on the sheet had already been identified, when one of these suddenly appeared on the market it was proved that it had been stolen many years before.

, Errors and odd quirks can arise due to overprinting. For example, during a time of a change in postal rates and insufficient time to print new stamps, stamps of one denomination may have a figure designating the new denomination printed over the old one. One famous example is that of the ""Molly Pitcher"" on the regular two cent United States stamp in commemoration of her work at the Battle of Monmouth. This method eliminated the engraving and printing of a new stamp, thereby saving costs and paper.

, Governments and individuals have been known to produce errors intentionally in order to profit from stamp collectors. It can be very difficult to prove but where it has been, you will find this information in reputable stamp guides and stamp catalogues.

Forget everything you've ever heard non-dinosaur-lovers say about dinosaurs.,
Check out every book on dinosaurs from every library near you, and read up.,
Memorize more dinosaur names than just the most famous ones.,
Keep an eye on science news websites.,
Surf around to find dinosaur fan sites.,
Sketch dinosaurs.,
Visit museum exhibits and other special dinosaur shows.,
Watch documentaries on dinosaurs.,
Collect fossils!",How to Become an Expert on Dinosaurs," The real information is often much more exciting and fascinating and you'll only get to know this upon learning about it for yourself through reading, research, and watching good science shows about dinosaurs. If you're up for the challenge, follow the next steps!;
, Do this at a regular pace rather than overwhelming yourself. If you compare some of the older books on dinosaurs with newer ones, you will notice big changes in the knowledge about dinosaurs in just the last few decades, so be sure to get the most up-to-date books that you can find.

, Namely, go beyond the usual well-known dinosaurs such as the T-Rex, Triceratops, and the Stegosaurus. Don't try to learn all of the names though; there are way too many for that!

, A new dinosaur is found every two weeks, so there won't be huge gaps between new bits of information. It can fun trying to piece together the new information and being the first in your class to know about new dinosaur finds.

, Visit the ones that you enjoy on a frequent basis and read up on dinosaur lore. Remember dinosaurs never met cavemen, mammoths, Saber-tooth Tigers or any prehistoric mega mammals.

, It's a lot easier to remember the name of an obscure animal if you've spent a few hours trying to render it well. Try to keep your drawings as up to date as possible - some dinosaurs are proven to have feathers and at least a few scientists have discovered what color they were! The more you practice, the better your Dino-drawings will look.

, Often you will see life size replicas of dinosaurs. In addition, there will be great information displays and you can probably pick up the latest books and information sheets on dinosaurs from their shops. Museum websites are also another good resource for dinosaur information that is kept up-to-date.

, Sometimes there is an IMAX film or good documentaries on TV about dinosaurs. Ask for a DVD on dinosaurs for your birthday.

, It is possible to buy authentic fossils from rock shops or museum gift shops. A good example would be Spinosaurus teeth, which are almost always in stock. Just watch out for scammers.

Print labels.",How to Buy Postage Online3," When you’re mailing items that are larger than a letter or card, postage is determined by the weight so you need to know how much your item weighs. It’s best to use a scale specifically meant for postal items because it will provide the most accurate weight. You can purchase postage scales at most office supply stores. Place your item on the scale and note the weight.If you don’t buy postage online that often, you probably don’t want to invest in your own postage scale. Instead, use a regular kitchen or bathroom scale.

, On the USPS website, find the “Mail & Ship” tab in the bar at the top of the website. Beneath it, you’ll find a link for the “Click-N-Ship” option. This service allows you to print and pay off postage labels to place on your item. Follow the link to begin the process.Underneath the “Mail & Ship” tab, you’ll also find an option for scheduling a pick-up. That way, you can arrange for the postal service to pick up the item that you’re mailing after you’ve paid for the postage so you don’t have to take the item to a mailbox or post office.

, First, you’ll need to provide the return address or the address that the item is being mailed from. The USPS will supply the mailing address that you entered when you sent up your account, but you can edit it if you wish to use a different return address.When you’re selecting a return address, you also have the option of signing up for tracking notifications on the item so you can watch its progress as it makes its way to the destination.

, Next, you’ll need to provide the address of the person or business that you’re sending your item to. Make sure that all of the information is correct because an error can cause a delay in the item’s arrival. Keep in mind that the site automatically standardizes the address according to postal records.The USPS allows you to create an address book on the website, so if there are certain people or businesses that you routinely send items to, you can store their information to avoid having to enter it every time.

, You can choose a flat rate for your item. That means if the item fits inside one of the USPS’s flat rate boxes, envelopes, or other packaging and weighs under 70 pounds, it ships for a flat rate. However, if you’re using your own box or packaging materials, you need to provide the item’s weight to determine the postage costs.If you haven’t weighed your item, the USPS site provides a list of average prices of items that are often mailed. It’s always best to round up if you’re unsure, though. That way, the item won’t be returned to you for insufficient postage.

They commit to your item arriving overnight, and if it doesn’t, you can request a refund. After choosing a service, add the postage to your cart.Priority Mail is the cheaper postage option.
Priority Mail Express is delivered 7 days a week, but you must use one of the USPS Priority Mail Express flat rate boxes for your item.

Make sure the packet is ""all-different"" so you get a wide variety of stamps, not multiples of the same stamp.;
, You can buy unused commemorative stamps from any post office, often with appealing designs aimed at collectors. Some collectors prefer these new, ""mint condition"" stamps due to the higher quality, while others enjoy reading the cancellation ink mark the post office puts over stamps used in the mail. You can specialize in one type or the other if you like, but it's fine to keep both types in your collection.

, Businesses often receive a lot of mail, and may receive mail internationally if they work with other businesses or international clientele. Friends and family might also be willing to save stamps from letters they receive, and pass them on to you.

, If you enjoy writing and receiving letters, find a pen pal so you can have an ongoing conversation. Pen pal websites online might help you find someone in another country, who might use stamps you wouldn't normally find.

, Once you have sorted through a few packets of stamps, you might have a pile of duplicates, or stamps that don't interest you. You can trade these stamps with other collectors for their own duplicates, expanding your collection. If you do not have any friends or coworkers who collect stamps, ask employees and customers at the local hobby shop or stamp dealer if they're interested in trading.


At the early stage of the hobby, it is best to trade one stamp for one stamp, instead of trying to learn the market value. One exception is stamps that are torn, damaged, or covered by a heavy cancellation (post office ink), which is typically worth less than a stamp in good condition.

, Seasoned stamp collectors often meet to share tips and trade stamps. You can try to find one near you on the American Philatelic Society website, even if you're not located in the United States.


If you want to meet more dedicated hobbyists, you can find a stamp show instead, where people compete for prizes with their stamp collections.

, Find stamp tongs online or at a hobby store, and use them instead of your fingers, to avoid causing damage from oils or moisture. These are often called tweezers because they so resemble them, but are weaker and smoother to avoid damaging the stamp. Thin, rounded tips make it easy to slide underneath a stamp, while sharp points should be avoided due to the possibility of tears.

, Used stamps are typically removed from the envelope before storing. If you like collecting the cancellation marks, or the post office ink mark over the stamp, cut out a rectangle of paper around the mark and skip ahead to the storage step in this section. Otherwise, cut a small square around the stamp itself. You don't have to be precise, since the steps below will remove the remaining scrap of paper.


Because the cancellation mark takes up a lot of space in your collection, most collectors only save the most interesting ones.

, This traditional method works on U.S. stamps from before 2004, and most stamps from other countries. Put the paper-backed stamps in a bowl of lukewarm water, with the stamp face up. Use enough room for each one to float to the surface. After 15–20 minutes, once the stamps have begun to separate from the paper, use your stamp tongs to transfer the stamps to a dry paper towel.Handling the wet stamp very gently, scrape off the remaining paper. If the paper does not come off, let the stamp soak longer. Do not try to peel off the stamp.


Stamps on brightly colored paper or with purple ink marks should be soaked in separate bowls, since the ink on the paper might bleed and dye the stamps.

, Once the paper is removed, rinse the back of the stamp in fresh water to remove the last of the gummy residue. Let the stamps dry overnight on a paper towel. If the stamps curl, you can place them between paper towels and sandwich them in between heavy books.

, Self-adhesive stamps, including all U.S. stamps since 2004, cannot be removed from paper using the traditional warm water method.Instead, find a non-aerosol, 100% natural, citrus-based air freshener, such as Pure Citrus or ZEP. Spray a small amount onto the paper attached to stamps, so the paper is soaked and translucent. Turn the stamp face up, roll the paper corner slightly, and slowly peel off the stamp. To remove the sticky back, dip your finger in talcum powder and wipe the back of stamp lightly., After some time spent on the hobby, most stamp collectors decide to narrow in on a particular subcategory of stamps. Even if you decide to collect a much broader selection, choose a theme to help sort your collection. Here are some options to choose from:


Country — This is probably the most common way to sort a collection. Some people try to collect at least one stamp from each country in the world.
Topical collecting / Thematic collecting — Pick a stamp design that means something to you, or just one you find pretty or interesting. Butterflies, sports, famous people, and airplanes are just a few common stamp subjects.
Color or shape — Sorting by color can make an attractive collection. For a challenge, try to track down stamps in unusual shapes, such as triangles.

, Stamp albums, or ""stock books,"" protect your stamps from damage and keep them in visible, sorted rows and pages. Some of them come with printed images of stamps from a particular country or year, so you can place your stamps over the images as you collect them.Some albums are bound, while others are binders that can have new pages inserted. Black backgrounds tend to display the stamps more clearly.

, In some albums, you can store stamps by sliding them into plastic pockets. On others, you'll need to use a specialized adhesive that won't harm your stamps. Choose between these two options:""Hinges"" are small, folded pieces of paper or plastic. To use one, moisten the short end, stick it to the stamp back, then moisten the long end and attach to the stamp album. These are not recommended for valuable stamps.""Mounts"" are plastic sleeves, which are more expensive but better for your stamps. Fit the stamp into the sleeve, moisten the back of the sleeve, and stick it to the album.

, If your album pages have stamp storage space on both sides, use plastic sheets to prevent them rubbing into each other or tearing. Mylar, polyethylene or polypropylene are examples of effective protective plastics, but you may be able to find others.Avoid vinyl sheets, which cannot effectively protect materials long-term.

, Humidity, bright light, and temperature fluctuations can ruin your stamp collection, so keep it out of hot attics or damp basements. Don't store your collection near exterior doors or concrete walls, as these may introduce moisture. If you are storing your collection near the floor, place it in a box first., Stamp catalogs and price guides are excellent resources, having illustrated lists of stamps, arranged by year, that give a current market value for a given stamp issue. The most widely recognized catalogs are: the Scott Postage Stamp Catalog, Stanley Gibbons for Great Britain issues, Yvert et Tellier for French issues, Unitrade for Canadian issues, and Minkus and Harris US/BNA for United States issues.


You can often find these books in a large library, if you don't want to purchase them yourself.

, With the designs of many stamp issues only differing by a line or a dot, magnifying glasses are probably the stamp collector's most valued tool. Small jeweler's loops are effective for most hobbyists, but extra valuable or difficult to identify stamps could call for a high-powered magnifying glass with a built-in colored light source., This tool measures the size of the perforated holes around the edge of the stamp, and is only necessary for advanced stamp collectors. These gauges tell you how many perforations fit in 2 centimeters (0.79 inches), which can greatly affect the price of a valuable stamp.If a stamp guide lists two numbers, such as ""Perf 11 x 12,"" the first number refers to the horizontal perforation and the second number refers to the vertical.

, The paper used to print stamps sometimes has a watermark, often too faint to identify by holding it up to the light. If you have a stamp that can only be identified with a watermark, you'll need a special watermark detection fluid that is non-toxic and safe for stamps.Place the stamp on a black tray and drip the fluid onto it to reveal the watermark.


This is also a good way to find creases and hidden repairs on a stamp.If you don't want to get your stamps wet, purchase a specialized tool for this purpose, such as a Sinoscope or Roll-a-Tector."

, Prepare a cup of warm water. Be sure that it is not hot, which will cause the stamp to be damaged. Submerge the envelope sections with the stamps attached for 30 minutes or so.

, After a period of time, the stamps should separate from the envelopes with ease. If the stamps refuse to come off, soak for a longer period of time. Some stamps are naturally harder to remove than others. Be very careful here!

, Carefully remove superficial water by drying the stamps with a paper towel. When doing this, do not wipe the stamps for obvious reasons; press the towel to the stamps instead.

, Arrange the stamps on a sheet of paper. Stack additional layers of paper above and below this original layer. Place a textbook on top of this arrangement. Let the stamps dry completely for a couple of hours. In short, press the stamps as if you were pressing leaves.

, Purchase a stamp album to hold your stamps. (I personally do not have an album, so I store my stamps in small homemade envelopes. For example, each unique type of stamp has its own envelope. I use a larger envelope (based on year) to contain these small envelopes.)

Find a suitable storage space for your linens.,
Prepare the linens for storage.,
Protect the linens.,
Place in storage.,
Check stored linen periodically.",How to Store Vintage Linens," The best environment for storing linens is one free from dampness and pests. A linen closet, a suitcase, a cedar-lined box, etc., can all be suitable storage places provided that are dry, free of pests such as moths, and will not be disturbed by everyday use of other items.


It is also important that the storage space is dark. Light will eventually fade and weaken fabric and embroidery.;
, There are several things to do prior to placing the linens into storage:


Check for food or other stains. If there is anything that might attract moths, wash the item according to its care requirements.
Ensure that all linens are completely dry. Storing damp linen will cause mildew growth that will spread quickly through neighbouring linen.
Don't starch linens. Starch is a pest attractant.
Don't iron. Ironing linens can cause hard seams. These hard edges can cause the fabric to crack or even break owing to its age. Besides, it's always good to have an excuse not to iron!

, It is prudent to provide covering around the linens to prevent staining. You can use either acid-free tissue paper (non-dyed is preferable as color might run) or plain cotton such as calico, muslin, old sheets and pillowcases, etc.).


Roll or pancake stack the linens in the covering. Rolling or stacking flat is the best way to avoid creating stress points on the linen. Folding can create cracks and breakage. Small items such as doilies are fine stacked, while larger items such as table runners or tablecloths are best rolled.
Use a poster tube for large rolled items such as tablecloths.
When pancake stacking, be sure to have heaviest at the base, lightest at the top. This will help to stop creasing or crushing of fine designs. If something is very delicate, do not stack it but roll it and keep it apart.

, If storing in anything that might cause stains, provide a barrier layer of plastic or paper between the stored linens and the storage space.


Wood can stain linen.
Scented drawer liners can stain linen.
Check all other items in the storage area to ensure that they cannot impart a stain, odor, or other sort of damage.
Consider adding linen protection sachets to the storage space.

, At least once a year, remove stored linen and check for insect damage, creasing, or signs of wear. It's also a good opportunity to take an inventory of your collection and to update or cull it as wished.

Keep thinking of other amazing uses for your linens.,

Don't forget the beauty of simply displaying your vintage linen pieces.",How to Reinvent Linens," This includes the linens that are stained and threadbare because there is always something that can be salvaged and resewn, reused, revamped, with a little imagination and experience. Always look for designs and embellishments in particular, that are worth salvaging. The sorts of linens that are great to hang on to include:





 Even simple framing can work well for favourite doilies

Embroidered, crocheted, tatted, etc., doilies, mats, tablecloths, napkins/serviettes, tea cosies, toaster covers, table runners, etc. Anything embroidered has many opportunities for reuse!
Old tea towels, both used and unused. Many people admit to having a tea towel that had such a pretty design that it was impossible to ever make use of it!
Vintage and collectible linens. These will always have continued value in their own right but if you make a decision to honour the original maker's work, you can also do a lot with these items when reinventing them.
Everyday items, including towels, hand towels, face washers, etc., can be found new uses when their old use expires.;
, Old linens can make delightful gift wraps, especially when they feature a beautiful design and embellishments such as lace or ribbon. Finish off by tying the gift together with gorgeous grosgrain, velvet or satin ribbon, or any other leftover item suitable for tying it together.

Wrap wine bottles in embroidered cloths.
Wrap delicate and easily stained items in linen.
Sew the linen into a distinctive gift bag.

Add linens to handmade cards.
Use various types of fancy scissor cuts (pinking shears) to make the edges of the linen more exciting.
Use linens to make gift tags. Let the linen help decide the shape of the tag. For example, if you are cutting out an animal motif from a linen, follow the shape of the animal for the tag.
Turn linens into bookmarks. Find suitable parts of linen to cut into a bookmark size. Cover in plastic contact if wished, for added protection. Attach ribbon or braiding to finish off the bookmark.

, This can be a spectacular medium for reinventing your linen collection into something that is both practical and beautiful at the same time.

Don't forget to reinvent old but beloved designs from pillow cases, sheets, quilt covers, and other bedding that is no longer used.
Curtains and tablecloths can also be used to make quilt pieces.

, As with the quilt, old linens can reinvent into amazing new cushions or pillows. Just be sure to match colours and patterns with careful attention to the details. Other embellishments can be added too; consider using items from your old button collection, or from stored lace, ribbons, and braids., Focusing on the decorative features of old linens, adding them to clothing items can be a way of giving new life to an old garment. Either sew the linen on, or use fusible webbing (a quilter's item), to add the linen to clothing.

Make a baby's bib using an old linen.

, There are two possible methods here for reinventing your linens:

Add linens as an embellishment to a new towel. Select the decorative elements, cut to size and stitch onto the towel.
Turn the old linen into a guest towel in its own right. Measure the linen against a guest towel and cut to size. Stitch down the edges to prevent fraying and add any embellishments if needed. Drying your hands on linen is a wonderful experience.

, If you have a beloved tea towel that has special memories, wonderful sayings, a gorgeous picture, etc., turning it into a wall hanging can be a fabulous way to keep it in the spotlight.

Iron the tea towel flat.
Place it on a backing board. Attach using tape or stitches. Make sure that it is taut.
Build a frame around the edges. A framing store can cut to size if you can't do this alone. Nail frame into place.
Attach a hanger at the back and hang on your wall.

, There are a number of great ways to reuse linens in the kitchen:

Make favourite linens into tea cosies.
Turn linen into a toaster cover.
Make coasters for hot drinks, or padded mats for hot foods.
Turn old linens into placemats.

Make sachets to ward off the moths in the pantry.

, There are many possibilities, from iPod covers to dog coats that can give your old linen collection a new lease of life. Just get started and your new hobby of reinventing linen will grow from there!

Be daring and stop hoarding. Linens tend to be beautiful creations, which is why you're holding on to them in the first place. They deserve to be put to better use, and to be seen!

, This is a ""reinvention"" of its own right, in which you make a conscious decision to take the linens out of the closet and display them as they once would have been."

Iron vintage linens prior to use rather than prior to long-term storage.,
Check the fabric of the linens.,
Fill the iron with distilled water.,
Turn the linen design side face down.,
Follow a method with each type of linen being ironed.,
Place linens on display.",How to Iron Vintage Linens," Ironed linen tends not to last as well as unironed because the ironing creates pressure points through creasing. Instead, rely on ironing to freshen up and improve linen about to be displayed.



Tablecloths and other large linen items are an exception as they won't be as easy to iron post storage – however, these should be in regular use, to avoid fabric strain.;
, On the whole, vintage linens will be made from cotton or linen and this article assumes that for the purposes of temperature settings.


Ironing linens while slightly damp is usually a good method.

, There needs to be a lot of steam to ensure an easier pressing. Set the temperature range from medium to hot.

, Iron the back of the linen. Then flip over and iron the other side. This will create a shiny surface, or ""sheen"".


While ironing, avoid ironing directly on any areas that are delicate. The iron can easily catch on them and tear them, or even scorch them. For example, avoid cutwork, fine embroidery, lace edges, tatting, etc. Sometimes it is possible to iron these on the turned-over side if they do not come through to that side.
Care should always be taken to reduce the heat setting for delicate parts, especially if it is not known whether or not they are synthetic.

, The following tips will help you to get a rhythm going:


Iron handkerchiefs, serviettes (napkins), doilies, etc., flat. Avoid adding weakening creases to them.
Iron tablecloths, bedspreads, quilts, table runners, and other large pieces from the centre first, and work your way out to the edges. You will need to turn the linen to make it accessible.
Dampen one hundred percent linen before ironing.

, Avoid creasing by checking that all corners are properly folded down and take care not to create creases from objects place on top of linens.

Note the age of the stamp.,
Know where the stamp was issued.,
Notice how well the design is centered.,
Note the stamp gum.,
Look at the perforations.,
Note whether or not the stamp has been cancelled.,
Determine how rare the stamp is.,
Evaluate the stamp's condition.,
Know the demand for the stamp.",How to Find The Value Of a Stamp1," Unlike coins, stamps generally do not bear a date showing the year they were issued, making the stamp's age harder to determine.


In some cases, a stamp's approximate age can be determined from the design on it, if the stamp was issued to honor a historical event at the time of the event.
Older stamps were also made with different grades of paper than more modern stamps.
Stamps used for a particular purpose, such as sea mail, have a history that's easier to trace, making it easier to determine their age.;
, How prominent a country was historically may have an impact on a stamp's value. The issuing country may display its name in an unfamiliar language or in an alphabet other than the Roman alphabet; if you can find the native country name rendered in the Roman alphabet, you can look it up at Nations Online to find the name it's known by in the English-speaking world.

, More important than the actual design is its centering on the stamp face. You can determine this by looking at the stamp upside down to see how well the design is positioned.

, Older postage stamps were backed with a gum that had to be licked to stick it onto the envelope or postcard surface. The gum material and its condition each have an impact on the stamp's value.


Mint gum is more prized by stamp collectors than a non-mint gum.
An evenly distributed, more complete gum makes a stamp more valuable than one where the gum has skips, creases, or has been partially or completely removed from the stamp. For this reason, a used stamp is generally more valuable still attached to an envelope or postcard than if it is removed from it.
Older stamp albums that held their contents in place with hinges also diminish the value of a stamp, as they damage the stamp's gum.

, In addition to having gum on the backs to adhere them to the mail, older stamps were printed in sheets with tiny round holes at the edges of the stamp faces to allow them to be separated from each other. Their size can be measured with a perforation gauge, while the perforation holes themselves should be crisply and cleanly cut.

, Cancellation marks prevent a stamp from being used for postage; they also diminish the stamp's value if they are too prominent. No cancellation mark or a very light cancellation mark are preferable to a cancellation mark that grossly interferes with the stamp design.

, The rarity of a stamp depends on how many copies of the stamp were produced to begin with. Stamps produced within the last 60 years are generally worth only their face value to mail postage because there are so many of them in existence. Likewise, the 1-cent Benjamin Franklin stamp of 1861 has less monetary value because it's been estimated that 150 million of them were produced.


Stamps with errors in the design, such as the famous ""upside down"" biplane stamp, are both rare and prized by stamp collectors. These stamps are among the few that have escaped the quality-control inspection to weed out such errors before distribution.

, The factors listed above all help to determine a stamp's condition, which can be expressed in two ways:


Stamp grade can be expressed in three broad terms: sound, faulty, or defective. A faulty stamp is one that has minor imperfections, such as a small crease in the corner. A defective stamp is one with major imperfections such as large creases, pinholes, abrasions, or stains. A sound stamp has no imperfections.
Stamp condition can be broken into seven smaller levels, similar to those used for coins: below average, fair, average, good, fine, very fine, and extremely fine.

, Even if a rare stamp is in excellent condition, it may not be sought after by stamp collectors. Connection to a major historical event or just general agreement on how prized a stamp is can affect how in demand a given stamp is.

Consult a printed reference.,
Research stamp values online.,
Visit stamp shows.,
Have the stamp appraised professionally.",How to Find The Value Of a Stamp2," You can research both a stamp's history and its value by consulting a stamp encyclopedia or catalog. Good stamp references available at most U.S. libraries include Richard John Sutton's ""Stamp Collector's Encyclopedia"" and the ""Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers"" for U.S. stamps, and in the United Kingdom, the Stanley Gibbons Commonwealth Catalog and the British Empire Stamp Catalog.

, A number of online resources exist for determining stamp values.


Auction websites such as eBay can give you an idea of the current market value for a given stamp. Be sure to compare your stamps as accurately with those depicted in the auctions, down to the specifics of their condition.
Stamp dealer websites such as Zillions of Stamps provide an online marketplace for stamp dealers to offer their wares and give you a basis to compare the value of your old stamps against theirs.
Stamp enthusiast websites such as StampCenter.com may include discussion forums where you can post questions and learn from other philatelists (stamp collectors).
While the Scott and Gibbons catalogs are not accessible online, the Stanley Gibbons catalogs are available through the company's website, and the Scott catalogs can be ordered through stamp dealers' websites.

, Collector shows featuring stamps will give you another opportunity to see the market rates for various stamps and to talk with other stamp collectors, some of whom may offer you their opinions on your stamp's value.

, A professional stamp appraisal is the best way to find the book value of a stamp, which will typically be higher than the market value you can expect to receive when selling it. Some appraisers are also stamp dealers.


You can get recommendations from other philatelists for stamp dealers and appraisers, or you can consult the websites of stamp appraiser associations such as the American Stamp Dealers Association or non-profit organizations such as American Philatelic Society.

Learn a little about the history of silver thimbles.,
Learn about the marks and designs on silver thimbles.,
Look for thimbles.,
Examine thimbles carefully when purchasing.,
Keep a record.,

Provide a suitable display area for your thimble collection.",How to Collect Thimbles," A good collector will always know the stories and history behind the items that they collect. Silver thimble availability was not as widely spread prior to the Victorian era, at which time there was a flourish in their production.. In fact, it was during the Victorian era that thimble collecting became a popular pastime. This means that thimbles earlier than the Victorian era will be likely more expensive and harder to find. Many of the earlier examples survive in mint condition, suggesting that they were not used but were used as display items.. Until the ""Dorcas method"" was patented by Charles Horner (Halifax) in 1884, silver thimbles only had a working life of 20 years;the Dorcas thimble, however, consisted of a steel core dipped in silver, creating better durability., When starting out as a collector, it is important to spend some time reading up on the background to silver thimble production and the marks and designs used in particular eras. Thimbles that are highly decorated are interesting objects to display but even a plain thimble with simple markings can be a bonus for a collector. Your own interest will no doubt be sparked by what you learn about thimbles, as well as your finds when you start looking for thimbles to collect. For basic understanding, however, here are some simple pointers:

Decorative (or souvenir/collector's) thimbles - there are many decorative styles including filigree work, scenes, plant and animal depictions, cherubs, borders, fleur-de-lys, sewing-related themes, etc. Some thimbles even have tiny Bibles attached to them, or doors that open to reveal a little scene.Working thimbles - these are the plain Jane thimbles that were made specifically to be used. Although these might not be as fancy, they carry a lot of value of their own nowadays and are highly collectable. Indeed, Dorcas thimbles are perfectly acceptable inclusions in a silver thimble collection, provided they are noted for what they are - steel-based silver coated thimbles. All Dorcas thimbles were made to be work pieces rather than decorative or souvenir pieces but they all have a charm of their own, whether or not they are plain. They come in a variety including dimples and engraved flowers.Hallmarked thimbles - patent, factory, manufacturer, etc., numbers and marks.
Commemorative thimbles - thimbles that serve as reminders of such events as crowning a king/queen, celebrating a country's anniversary, etc.
Brand promotion thimbles - thimbles made by a sewing or other brand to promote itself and its products. Even politicians advertised themselves by way of thimbles!Different country thimbles - thimbles were produced in many countries, including the USA, Britain, continental Europe, India, Australasia, etc.

, Suitable places for finding silver thimbles include:

Antique dealers - ask for their sewing/needlework accessories section.
Antique, colonial and general auctions - look through the sewing gear lots.
Online - look at auction sites such as eBay and Trademe, specialist vintage sewing shops online, trades, etc.
Collector's conventions - there are antique conventions and then there are specialized conventions tailored just for thimble collectors, such as the ones held by Thimble Collectors International.Grandma's sewing basket - seriously, it is worth asking family members what exciting things they might have stashed away in their sewing baskets, especially if they inherited sewing accessories from other family members. Ask nicely and you might be lucky.
Brand new silver thimbles. Why not support artists who still make silver thimbles as a work of art? These can make an amazing collection that is of great value in itself. Nothing says that a collection has to be ""old"".

, Here are some things to consider:

Is it silver or not? This can be tested easily using a magnet. A thimble that contains metal other than silver will be drawn to the magnet; a pure silver thimble will not be.Is it in good shape or really worn? A really worn one might be important for historical or sentimental reasons but, on the whole, it has far less value than thimbles that still retain their decorative features and hallmarks.
Is the design of good quality or is it second rate? Elizabeth de Castres warns that ""there is a variance in the quality as well as the design"" of silver thimbles., It is a really good idea to start with a good habit from the beginning. A good record of your collection not only helps you to remember the finer details, such as how much you paid and where you purchased a thimble from, but it also increases the value should you decide to sell the collection or will it to someone else. To keep good records of your collection, find a notebook, label it ""Thimble Collection"" or something similar and record the following for every thimble in your collection:

The date of purchase
The cost of purchase
The place of purchase
The condition at the time of purchase
Any interesting information you have, such as the make, history, design details etc.
Include a photo if possible; digital photos are very easy to take and print off (indeed, if preferred, you could make this into a fully electronic record notebook).

, Appreciate your collection by putting it out on display. A good place is to arrange the thimbles on a step stand inside a glass fronted cabinet. This helps keep away dust and makes it easy to see each thimble."

Assemble the things needed.,
Cut the cardboard to fit the frame.

Decide on whether you want to collect the vintage sewing tools and accessories according to a theme (category), an era, or some other method.,
Decide what you want your vintage sewing tools and accessories collection to consist of.,
Get hold of some good books on collecting vintage sewing accessories.,
Look for your vintage sewing accessories.,
Compare prices.,
Collect because you want to, because it fills you with joy.",How to Collect Vintage Sewing Accessories," There is a lot of sewing gear available to you and it can become overwhelming if you don't settle on a method for collecting. Some approaches to collecting include:


Choose an era. Collect sewing items made for a set period, such as Victorian times, war years, a particular decade such as the 20s or 60s, etc. The advantage of this is that the items can be narrowed down and you can have a lot of fun hunting them down, learning about which items belong to the specific era, etc., and you can focus your budget. A disadvantage to this approach is that you will have to leave items when they don't match your collection and it might become too narrow if the era you have picked is either full of rare and expensive items, or the items become rapidly repetitive.
Choose a theme or category. The theme or category approach can work brilliantly in collecting vintage sewing accessories because it is broader than an era and lets you roam widely for items that fit within your theme. Examples of themes might include a focus on thimbles/chatelaines/needle cases/tape measures, etc., (see list below for a whole range of ideas), or it could be slightly broader, such as bone or pearl sewing trinkets, or sewing machine items, etc.
Choose a country or region. Collect sewing items made or designed from your country during the decades. After the 60s, many items are made overseas, so the ""designed in"" aspect might become more important for your collection.
Commemorative items. Some sewing items were produced for commemorative purposes. This category might be ideal to base your collection on, provided it is in an area of sewing items that were used for commemorative items, such as thimbles.
Alternatively, just collect everything you come across and can afford. Beware though, as this can result in indiscriminate collecting and you will end up with pieces of very little value crowding out the more valuable pieces. It depends on your display space and memory!;
, The spectrum of sewing tools and accessories is broad, and there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes an ideal vintage sewing collection. In reality, it's a collector's right to include items that might seem peripheral but in some small way boost your collecting enjoyment. It's also the collector's right to define the collection's extent, with the key rationale being to keep it enjoyable! At its most basic, items that usually are included in a vintage sewing accessories collection include:


Chatelaines
Needle books, needle cases, needles, needles in packets
Old yarn and thread, especially still on spools, or in original packaging
Needle cases
Sewing baskets and contents (a delightful rummaging opportunity)

Sewing machine accessories, sometimes also sewing machines depending on age and beauty
Sewing kits

Thimbles and thimble boxes
Tape measures, especially novelty tape measures, rulers, and gauges

Mending and darning, darners, clamps
Sewing box paraphernalia, e.g., fasteners, hooks and eyes, etc.; the older and more interesting, the better
Scissors used for sewing, including pinking shears; scissors cases and sets
Old beads used for clothing, glass ones are especially prized
Buttons (a collectible in their own right)
Pin boxes

Pincushions and pins
Tatting shuttles, knitting needles, crochet hooks, rug hooks, etc. - bone, ivory, tortoiseshell, Bakelite, plastic, etc.

Embroidery frames
Netting needles, lacework accessories
Instructional booklets and patterns - for some people, these form a very important part of a vintage sewing accessories collection, including knitting, crochet, tatting, embroidery, and sewing patterns
Antique linens - these are sometimes included in vintage sewing collections as the end products of the hard work using the sewing tools.

, There are a number on the market, just do an online search in a favourite book store. These will help you with more in-depth knowledge about each of the sewing tools and accessories of interest to you. Importantly, these will provide photographs of accessories, some of which will be completely unfamiliar to you until you have had them explained first. Once you're in the know, you'll know what to look for!

, This is where the thrill of collecting comes into play. There are a number of places to find your goodies, depending on your budget. They include:


Antique stores and shops.
Antique fairs, shows, exhibitions.

Museum stores (be careful of reproductions unless you collect those too).
Online auction sites - get to know which sellers specialize in selling vintage sewing tools and accessories, as well as keeping an eye out for bargains generally. Try to look internationally, as different countries can sell different items of great interest to you.
Online stores that cater to vintage sewing tools and accessories.
Family members and friends can be a great source of vintage sewing collectables when they are cleaning out their sewing room or attic, or when a beloved person passes on.
Estate sales.

, This is especially important when you are starting out, as you won't have a good idea of the worth of the items to begin with. Always keep within a budget and aim to buy items at a price that will ensure you a small profit if you need to sell it on at a later date. Note that:


Rare, older, and good condition items will be more expensive. Resale value is always better for items in good to excellent condition, especially when accompanied by original packaging and elements.
Mass manufactured, commonplace, damaged items will be cheaper. Their resale value is dependent on luck and novice collectors.

, Collecting vintage sewing accessories for financial reasons would be a fickle choice; if you want to collect for profit, you are better off collecting old wine or fine art! Collect vintage sewing tools and accessories because you love them, and what they represent - the love, effort, and wisdom of those who have used these items through the ages. There is great pleasure in knowing and observing this aspect of your collection.

Ensure your quilt is clean before storing.,
Vacuum the quilt.,
Air the quilt.,
Wash the quilt.,
Wash the quilt in the bath.,
Wash by machine.,
Be very careful when cleaning antique quilts.,
Determine the age of your quilt.,
Wash your hands.,
Fold the quilt.,
Place the folded quilt inside a suitable protective cover.,
Bear in mind what not to do when storing a quilt.,
Put the quilt into a closet, or anywhere that is dark.,
Deter insects by adding some sort of repellent.,
Remove the quilt from storage periodically.",How to Store a Quilt," Any food scraps or stains need to be removed prior to storage as these tend to attract insects as their own food source. Also remove dirt, smudges and any other source of stains. The safest method for cleaning a quilt is vacuuming, followed by airing, then washing. Each approach is discussed in the following steps.;
, The best vacuum is a hand-held one, such as a dust buster. Alternatively, use the upholstery nozzle of a standard household vacuum cleaner, covered with muslin/cheesecloth or similar light fabric. Set the vacuum to the lowest level and sweep it back and forth across the quilt to collect loose fluff, debris and dirt. Check that the quilt looks okay before deciding whether anything further is needed before storage.


If the quilt is antique, place a nylon or fiberglass screen across the quilt before vacuuming; this will protect the fibers from the strong suction.

, If the only noticeable problem with the quilt is that it smells musty or unpleasant, airing might be the answer. To air the quilt:


Wait for a dry day without too much wind.
Find a suitable shady spot outside. The spot should be fairly clean, such as concrete, nice grass or fresh new leaves, etc. Don't choose a spot where there is a lot of dust liable to blow over the quilt.
Throw a large cotton sheet across the ground. This will keep the quilt separate from the surface, preventing any potential stains.
Lay the quilt over the sheet, taking care not to overlap at the edges.
Alternatively, a quilt that is in good, strong condition can be laid over a clothesline. If so, throw the base sheet over several of the lines of the clothesline (as if you were laying the table), then drape the quilt across the sheet, over the several lines. This method will probably use up all of the clothesline, so avoid doing it on a usual washing day. Avoid pinning the quilt to the clothesline as usually done for drying clothing, as this will stretch the stitches and fibers too much.

, This requires full knowledge on your behalf of what can happen to the quilt, and given that quilts are made from varying materials, this can be hard to know sometimes. Issues that you might encounter include dyes running, fabric shrinkage, stretched stitches and fibers due to the heaviness of being wet and pummeling by the washing process itself. To know whether or not it's okay to wash the quilt, answer the following questions:


Do you know the age of the quilt? A more recent quilt may be less impacted by a wash than an older one.
What condition is the quilt in? If it's already falling apart, washing is not really an option. However, it is possible to baste fraying edges with tulle, organza or netting before washing, provided you're up for the extra effort.
Have you tested the fabric dyes in the quilt? This is easier done if you made the quilt as you'll likely have swatches of the fabric pieces used. If it's an heirloom quilt, and the person who made it is still alive, ask this person whether the fabrics are dye-fast. If neither is possible, test by dampening a back or non-obvious section of each fabric pieces and blot with a white face washer or other cloth. If the dye comes off on the blotter, you'll know it's going to run during a wash. Even if it doesn't come off on the blotter, try this test again with a little detergent this time; if the dye shows, the fabric will run when detergent is added. If both tests show no dye, it's safe to wash.
Has the quilt been washed before? If so, you'll already know how it stood up to a wash.
Is the quilt strong or fragile? Only strong quilts should be washed.

, If you've answered the above questions to your satisfaction, consider washing by hand. Machine washing is really only suitable for very strong quilts (or those cheap ones made in China that you intend to only hang on to for a short time). The bathtub is the best place as it's big and there's plenty of room to maneuver. Ideally, you will need a helper to wash and lift the wet quilt.


Fill the bath about 8 inches/20cm with lukewarm/tepid water. (If your local water is hard, consider using distilled water or rainwater from the tank, heated in a kettle or saucepan.)
Lower a large sheet into the bath first. This acts as a ""sling"" for the quilt.
Gently lower the quilt onto the sheet.
Press gently across the quilt. Swish the water around gently, but not the quilt; keep it steady.
If using a detergent, make sure it is suitable for the quilt. Ask at a local quilt retailer or society for advice on a suitable detergent. A wool wash will usually be okay if you can't find a specialized detergent but dilute it before adding it to the bathwater.
Drain the water, taking care to keep the quilt away from the drain suction. Refill with lukewarm water for a rinse cycle. Gently agitate, drain again. Do this about 4 to 6 times until you feel the quilt has been cleaned adequately and the detergent is off the quilt.
Drain one last time. Pat the quilt with large dry and clean towels. These will start to absorb leftover water from the quilt.
Lift the quilt out of the bath by holding the corners of the sheet it is sitting on. Carry it outside to dry (see Airing above, although you may wish to substitute a blanket for a sheet on the ground). This really needs to be done with a helper, to prevent a mishap (and wet quilts tend to be heavy). When drying, place right side down to keep this as clean as possible.
Allow to dry completely. It should not be stored until it is completely dry, to avoid the possibility of mildew growth.

, This is riskier than washing by hand but may be suitable for a strong, modern quilt that you know won't run when washed. It's also a fairly painful process because you can't just shove the quilt in and walk away. Here is what to do:


Check that the quilt will fit. Many times they won't and it's no good pushing it in so tightly that it'll break the washing machine.
Use the delicate washing cycle only. Use wool wash for the detergent, or a suitable quilt detergent.
Check the progress of the washing every half a minute.
Stop the washing after 3 minutes.
Use a short rinse cycle. If you have a gentle spin dry, use this.
Remove the quilt from the washing machine. Dry as for Airing above.

, These aren't just old, they're usually very delicate and they've suffered their fair share of wear and tear. The fibers and colors of such quilts are likely to have been exposed to light, moisture and acidic conditions over time and hence will have weakened.


If the quilt seems too fragile to wash, call a local museum or textile conservator society to ask for their opinion. There will usually be someone in such a community organization who is willing to offer advice on the best cleaning options.
Do not give an antique quilt to a dry cleaner unless a select service is recommended by a quilt society or textile conservator.

, Older quilts lack the strength and resilience of quilts made from more modern materials. As such, the age of the quilt will determine some of the storage method, requiring greater care about folding and using non-acidic materials for storing.

, Your body oils will transfer to the fabric as you prepare the quilt for storage. Either wash your hands and dry thoroughly or don a pair of cotton gloves.

, This will enable you to place it inside a protective cover and then place on a shelf or other storage space. However, it is a good idea to use acid-free paper between each layer of the quilt to protect it from staining and creasing, and wherever the folds are, stuff these with crumpled acid-free paper to prevent the holds from becoming too permanent.


If you can, store the quilt flat rather than folding it; this is the most ideal way of storing, although it is recognized that few people have such space to spare.
If the quilt is small and thin, roll it around a tube; this will prevent creases and folds from forming.

, The cover will protect it from insects, dust and other sources of potential damage. Cover with a cotton pillowcase or similar cotton sack. A large cotton sheet or length of muslin can improvise as a cover.


Plastic is not an ideal covering; it can sweat (creating humidity) and some plastic bags may even leach colors from dyes and damage the quilt, especially with long-term storage.
Anything that the quilt is stored in or on must be acid-free.

, Things that should be avoided during quilt storage include:


Direct sunlight
Direct or close heat (even from an incandescent bulb; if possible, replace with fluorescent lighting inside the storage area)
High temperature or high humidity
Acidic surfaces (this includes some wooden surfaces).

, If quilts are stored in semi- or full-light, they will fade overtime.


It is not a good idea to put quilts in storage anywhere that moisture is likely to occur, such as the basement or the attic. Moisture will cause mildew growth in fabric. And if the quilt is overheated, it will begin to fall apart, while very cold temperatures will cause it to turn brittle.
The temperature range for storing a quilt is ideal around 59 - 68ºF/15 - 20ºC, with humidity around 50 percent.

, Many herbs are suitable for this purpose, as are cedar balls or blocks.


Do not allow insect repellents to come into direct contact with the stored quilt (or any other fabrics in the storage space).

, Don't expect to be able to store a quilt for years without ever opening it. A quilt needs to be aired regularly and folded out to prevent permanent fold lines and musty odors. At least every 6 months, be prepared to remove the quilt, air it (see above) and let it remain unfolded for a few days before returning it to storage.


If you have a guest bedroom, this is an ideal space to leave the quilt spread out for a week to ""unfold"" before returning to storage.

Evaluate the precious metal content by checking an online coin melt calculator.,
Find out how many similar coins were minted.,
Evaluate the condition of the coins.,
Consider the popularity of the series.,
Note any historical significance.,
Account for unique design elements.",How to Buy Silver Coins1," The value of 90 percent silver coins (minted prior to 1964) tends to vary directly with the activity of the silver bullion market. However, in the case of rare silver coins, the precious metal content has little influence on the coins’ ultimate value.;
,


Find the mint mark. Coins minted prior to 1968 will usually have mint marks on the reverse, while coins minted after 1968 will have mint marks on the front. The mint mark tells you where the coin was made.
Note the year of the coin. When you know the location and the year of the coin, you can find out how many copies of the coin were minted at that time by checking a coin price guide or a coin encyclopedia. Coin lines with fewer minted copies tend to be more valuable than coin lines in which many copies were minted.
Search coin encyclopedias for any major varieties or errors. Some years and mints will have rare doubled die errors, or variations in the designs of the coins, especially with popular older coins that may be silver, such as Morgan Dollars. Particularly with Morgan Dollar Varieties (VAM Varieties), there are numerous variations for each year/mint and some command a very large premium. Varieties can be particularly rare and valuable even if the year and mint is common.

,


Examine the luster. The luster is the degree to which light reflects from a coin’s surface. Microscopic lines in the design will impact luster, and luster will diminish as the coin’s surface finish wears away.
Notice the color. Color can be negatively altered if the coins have been chemically cleaned. Look for vibrancy of color and the natural hue of silver.
Look for detracting marks, like fingerprints, that result from improper packaging or handling.
Evaluate overall eye appeal. Eye appeal is influenced by carbon streaks, vinyl damage, and other striking defects. While this category is a bit subjective, factors that detract from a coin’s overall appearance will lessen its value.

, Series that are rarer or have a higher demand will price higher than more common series.


Check a site like eBay and evaluate the price of the coin. If a coin is rare, people tend to bid the price up to high levels.
Check a coin price book or other publication once you know the mint location, condition, and year of production. This will give you the book value of the coin, although market conditions could have further influences on the price.

, If a coin was produced during a certain time period or to commemorate a specific event, it may have added value. Read up on your coin’s history in a price guide or an encyclopedia.

, Occasionally, minting errors result in one-of-a-kind coins that are far more valuable than other coins from the same period. Read about your minted coin in a coin price guide or encyclopedia to find out if you should look for any unique markings that will add to its value.

Choose a reputable dealer.,
Consider a dealer who is an Authorized Purchaser working with the United States Mint.,
Verify the current market price of silver before making a purchase.,
Avoid purchasing coins online unless you have experience in grading.",How to Buy Silver Coins2," You will be depending a bit on their expertise, so you should pick a dealer that you are comfortable doing business with.


Verify the length of time that the dealer has been in business. A measurable business history means that the dealer is more likely to be experienced and reliable.
Work with a dealer who offers a variety of coins. If silver coins lose value or if you decide to expand your investment options, this will save you the trouble of finding a new dealer.

, Choosing a dealer who is authorized by the U.S. Mint gives you an extra level of assurance and security.


Know that most Authorized Purchasers have been in business for at least 5 years and have a well-established wholesale network.
Rest assured that Authorized Purchasers have had a full financial audit by an independent Certified Public Accounting firm recognized by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Know that Authorized Purchasers are well capitalized. These dealers must have a net worth of $10 million for at least 3 fiscal years.

, You should go into the price negotiation knowing that the U.S. Mint charges dealers $2 per coin as a purchase premium. Expect the dealer to charge you a reasonable premium on top of the price of silver.

, The one exception to this rule would be making online purchases from the U.S. Mint.

Visit an online trading site to find tokens.,
Try antique stores.,
Try coin dealers.,
Join or visit clubs.,
Go to a public auction.,
Visit websites.,
Advertise in the newspaper that you're looking for trade tokens.,
Go metal detecting.,
Ask friends, neighbors and family for tokens.",How to Buy Trade Tokens," For example, Ebay. Online trading sites are probably the easiest places to buy trade tokens. For eBay, the following considerations hold when hunting the site for trade tokens:


Most United States trade tokens are listed in Coins and Paper Money/Exonumia/US Trade but there are many different categories of tokens listed under Exonumia including: Civil War tokens, Hard Times tokens, Transit tokens, Good Luck tokens, So-Called Dollars, Love tokens, Tax tokens, etc.
Some of these US tokens are trade tokens which circulated during a certain period of time. For, example Hard times Tokens were merchant tokens and patriotic tokens which circulated in the 1830s and 1840s and were the size of a large cent. Civil War tokens were patriotic or store card tokens which circulated during the civil war. Good Luck tokens were often issued by merchants and had good luck symbols.
Exonumia isn't the only place where you can buy tokens on eBay. Military tokens are sometimes listed under Exonumia, but many of them are listed under Militaria. So, a lot depends on the type of token you are collecting. If you collect World's Fair tokens - some of these are listed under Historical Memorabilia on eBay, some are listed under So-Called Dollars, come are listed under medals, etc.
Many coin collections have tokens included in the collection. There are paper tokens, which might be listed under Exonumia, but they also may be listed under paper currency or stamps, or paper ephemera; learning which categories to look for an item can take a lot of time and experience. A number of tokens can be found in the Collectibles area under wholesale lots/other, which is where the junk drawer lots are located (the junk drawers are typically a person's watches, tokens, coins, and personal items); sometimes there are interesting collections of tokens in these lots. A
Many sellers regularly sell large lots of tokens and medals to collectors and there are many of these lots for sale on eBay.
There are also tokens available in many other categories - such as Science Fiction and Fantasy tokens such as the Game of Thrones tokens, etc.;
, Many antique stores have old tokens and medals and coins. They are often not always priced reasonably but sometimes they have interesting tokens for sale. If there is an antique store locally where you can call in every once in a while, have the owner put aside tokens for your to look over and buy the ones you want.


Some stores will have a bowl containing a number of tokens and you can find many tokens at an antique mall.

, Many coin dealers sell tokens and many of them have quite a few tokens for sale in addition to their regular stock.

, There are many different clubs related to many different types of tokens - for example if you collect lumber tokens there are other lumber token collectors out there and you can join a club or organization which specializes in the type of tokens you want to collect. Many of these clubs have their own auctions and those clubs are a great place to pick up whichever tokens you may be looking for.


The clubs may also have swap meets, at which you can exchange tokens you have duplicates of, for ones you don't yet have.

, Many public auctions have tokens in their auction. Visit a number of different auctions. Auctions may sell better tokens individually or they may sell bulk lots of tokens. This is a good way to buy a lot of better items, or items in bulk. There are some auctions which specialize in tokens.

, There are many web sites where people specialize in tokens and are trying to sell tokens - some sell by the pound, etc.


Buy tokens on Amazon.com and other websites. These might be places you wouldn't ordinarily think of as having tokens but they may well have them if they specialize in selling ""everything"".
Visit https://www.listia.com/. This is a website where you give items away for points and then you can spend the points on items you wish to obtain. They have a few tokens on this site, but not very many.

, There may be collectors out there willing to part with some.

, You can find tokens with a metal detector but it isn't easy.

, Ask them if they've any such things stashed away in junk drawers, the attic or old coin collections. Trade tokens often get mixed in with amateur coin collections, so offering to rummage through these to find them can be a helpful suggestion and the person may be happy to let you do so.

Do not sell to “rogue” buyers.",How to Buy and Sell Gold Coins for Profit," It is good to have at least some knowledge about gold coins when buying and selling. The standard weight for a gold coin is one Troy ounce (31.1 grams, a little heavier than the standard ounce). There are coins that weigh less than one Troy ounce (1ozt), but they trade less frequently, and you will pay a bigger percentage premium to buy them from dealers. That will cut into your potential profits. , The Troy ounce is used because a standard measurement system is needed since gold is an important, universal material. The difference between the two measurements matters more as you buy more gold. For example, a 100 Troy ounce bar of gold is not the same as 100 ounces of sugar. You would be losing 8.85 Troy ounces of gold. Calculate carefully., Gold coins can be segregated into various types. The two main types are bullion and numismatic. Bullion coins are more commonly acquired by gold investors because the prices are transparent. The price of gold depends on the market price of physical investment grade gold.The most common bullion coins are American Gold Eagles and Canadian Maple Leafs.
Bullion gold coins of today usually have 90% or higher level of gold content and are 22k to 24k.

, Numismatic coins are most often purchased by gold collectors. The price of this gold coin is more dependent on outside factors, like rarity of coin, than market price. Rare collectible numismatic coins can sell at a very high premium--more than the gold value alone. Most of the buyers and sellers of numismatic gold coins have decades of experience. It is not recommended for beginners.A few examples of numismatic coins are British Sovereigns, 20 Swiss Francs, and $10 Eagle coins.Bullion coins are made year-to-year. Numismatic coins are not produced in modern times.

, Gold is sometimes traded in hard times for things like cigarettes and shoes, but it won’t get you by in a time of crisis. This is because gold loses its value in times of crisis. Gold is not stable, and it is actually a commodity because it is a metal. Gold is, however, a good investment if you follow the market, carefully choose the type of coins you buy, and don’t solely rely on it for financial insurance.As the value of money falls, the value of nominal gold rises and vice-versa. You should also consider investing in silver if you are looking for something to fall back on during hard times., You should check the price of gold the day you plan to buy. Don’t pay more than a 5% to 8% markup on the price, based on what the price is that day. A small markup is normal because the extra cost typically covers the price of minting and shipping, the dealer, and the authorized purchaser.You can check the current price of gold on websites like www.goldprice.org

, Look into extraneous fees and the validity of the company you are buying from before making a purchase. You should look into fees like shipping costs, hidden commission, insurance fees, or extra charges due to payment type. Use your judgment and compare with other vendors to make sure you’re not being overcharged., It is important to buy from a legitimate vendor when purchasing gold. Research the business you plan to buy from on websites like Better Business Bureau and RipOffReport.com The vendor should have many positive peer reviews, and a generally good rating.Before buying, you should also check to see if the vendor will buy back the gold coins, and if they will give you a fair price in years to come.

, There are many ways you can buy gold coins. You can buy from the government, online, or from a local retailer. Your best bet is to compare prices on whichever coin you're thinking of buying.

, Their coins usually come with a reliable guarantee of gold content, weight, and purity. The variety of coins may be limited, but you can feel safe buying from the government. Buying from the government, however, may not be the best option if you are looking for old and/or rare coins.The US government sells gold coins online at usmint.gov

, There are numerous websites to buy coins from online, like ebay.com and goldsilver.com. Because there are so many sites out there, be sure to check every website out before considering a purchase. Most retail sites offer multiple methods of purchase, like PayPal, credit card, money orders, and checks.Don’t jump on the lowest price. The vendor with the lowest price may not be the one that provides the best quality of purchase.

, You can buy locally from a jewelry shop or pawn shop. This is the riskiest route, however. Some dealers make shady guarantees in order to trick buyers into purchasing their coins. Try to obtain a price guarantee (a specific value guarantee that the dealer places on your coin). If buying within your state, check the United States Mint website for a list of reputable dealers by state.Go to www.usmint.gov to check by state. The US Mint checks the dealers, but does not vouch for them.

, If you want to buy coins below market value, like the dealers do, learn how to buy coins from the public. You can do this by looking through yard sales and buying online from websites like eBay. Make sure you do so legally though. Avoid soliciting others for their gold., Make sure the coins are real soon after you make your purchase. One of the most important things you can do to minimize your losses is make sure the coins are made from real gold without damaging them. You can do this by testing things like the weight, sound, and acidity.Gold is a dense metal. Even if the coin weighs what it should, check the diameter and thickness. Sometimes fake coins will make up for weight by a thicker diameter and thickness. Or, they will be underweight to make up for the size. Check the weight and thickness by using a jeweler’s scale and calipers.
Strike the gold coin with another coin. It should chime. Base metals will sound duller, and the sound will not last as long.
Buy an acid test to see if the gold coin is genuine. Do not overdo this because the test can cause permanent damage to the coin. You check the quality by rubbing the gold on a black stone, which will leave a mark. You then apply nitric acid to the coin. Any mark that is not gold should dissolve.
Have a third party certified coin dealer verify they are real.

, Any secure method of storage is going to cost you money. Consider a bank safe deposit box, a home safe, or a safekeeping program offered by some gold dealers. This mainly concerns investors, though. You will keep the coins on hand, in a lock box, or safe temporarily if you plan to resell them for a quick profit., It is just as important to know the price of gold when you’re selling as it is when you’re buying. Most newspapers report the price of gold daily, and you can get almost instantaneous updates online at several sites. Don’t sell the gold immediately unless the type of coin you have is doing very well. Check the site often and sell when the coin is doing well, or when you really need it.Keep track of the price www.goldprice.org
Even if the coin is doing particularly well, it is wise to wait years before selling certain coins.

, This is also widely reported. As mentioned, there tends to be an inverse relationship between that and the value of gold. It is best not to sell when the currency for your country is doing very well. Instead, wait for the currency to decline in value., This is where both research and intuition steps in. You want to sell your coins right before the value of gold starts going down, so that you walk away from the transaction with more money than you spent on the coins. Since timing the market does not always work, you should consider selling when the price of gold is at all time high, the demand is very high, the sentiment is generally bullish, and you are sitting at a sizeable profit.No matter what the reports say and how the market is doing, the choice to sell is ultimately up to you.

, It is an option to sell directly to a jeweler or pawn shop, but you should make a trip to either or both places no matter where you sell. Look for a reputable jeweler or pawn shop, take your gold coins to them, and ask to have an estimate to assess their value. Use that value as the base of what you charge, whether it is online, like on eBay, to an individual, or to a retailer.Go to three or four shops for estimations.

, Rogue buyers are those who come to town, set up in places like a hotel ballroom, and disappear without paying. These buyers will make false promises to buy for high prices, but will actually pay for less than what the gold is worth. For example, a piece of gold appraised for $250 may only get an offer of $130 from a rogue buyer.Stick to selling to retailers approved by the Better Business Bureau to assure that you are not being cheated.

If you plan to deposit the coins, first ask your bank for its requirements.,
Acquire coin wrappers.,
Separate your coins into different types.,
Lay out the coins of one type onto a bed or other soft surface.,
Separate the coins into piles of ten coins.,
Push open the wrappers.,
Check how many coins there are per roll.,
Pick up enough piles to make one roll.,
Arrange the handful of coins into a cylinder shape.,
Pour the coins into a wrapper.,
Fold the open ends of the wrapper.,
Repeat for your remaining coins.",How to Roll Coins1," Each bank develops its own policies for dealing with coinage. Your bank may only accept rolled coins, unrolled coins, or coins of a certain value. Ask a bank teller over the phone or in person before you start sorting your coins, to avoid wasting time on coins you won't be able to deposit.;
, Banks usually give these cylindrical wrappers out for free, at least in the United States and in countries that use the euro as currency, and they are also available for purchase at some supermarkets. The wrappers may be made out of paper or transparent plastic, and come in a different size for each type of coin.


These wrappers are usually labeled with the name of the coin, but there may be a color-coded system as well. For instance, in the United States, red wrappers are for pennies, blue for nickels, green for dimes, and orange for quarters., Gather your change and separate the coins by type. You can keep the different coins in rough piles for now; there is no need to stack them or count them yet.


If you have a large amount of mixed coins, you may prefer to look at the section on other methods for information on coin-sorting machines.

, Take your newly separated coins of one type, such as nickels or 25 euro-cent coins, and place them on a flat surface cleared of other objects. Spread them out with your hands until they form a single layer of coins.


A freshly made bed, a comforter stretched over a coffee table, or a similar soft surface makes it easy to pick up the coins, and to keep piles of coins separated in their own ""dents"" in the material., Work with both hands at once, counting to ten as you pick up one coin in each hand. Once you have ten coins in each hand, place each group of ten coins in its own separate pile. As you keep doing this, the task should become easier and faster.


You may be tempted to stack the coins instead of making piles, but this is usually a waste of time, since the stacks often fall over., Unfold one end of each wrapper if necessary. Some wrappers are sold as open tubes, in which case you can skip this step.


As with any task, this becomes faster with repetition. Opening all your wrappers at once will be faster than opening one, filling it with coins, opening the next, etc.

, Each wrapped roll of coins contains a certain number of coins, depending on the wrapper. You can calculate this based on the value printed on the wrapper, or refer to the following list:


Each U.S. roll contains 50 pennies, 40 nickels, 50 dimes, or 40 quarters.Each euro roll contains 50 one-cent, two-cent, or five-cent coins; 40 ten-cent, twenty-cent, or fifty-cent coins; or 25 one-euro or two-euro coins., For example, if you are picking up pennies, pick up five piles of ten pennies each, since 5 x 10 = 50. If you are rolling one-euro or two-euro coins, you'll need to pick up 2½ piles, or two full piles (twenty coins total) and half of another pile (five coins).


If you have small hands, you may need to pick up a smaller amount of coins and fill each roll in sections.

, Shake the coins gently in your hand, while using your other hand to arrange them in a sideways stack. Once finished, the coins will be standing on their edge, running in a line from your palm to your cupped fingertips. When you're rolling coins for the first time, make the cylinder of coins as even as possible, to make it easy to get the coins in the paper or plastic wrapper. As you practice this, you'll be able to work faster and make looser cylinders., If the wrapper is open on both ends, stick a finger from your other hand into one end of the wrapper, up to the first joint, to block it off. Then tilt your hand down toward the other open end, letting the coins slide down into the wrapper.


If the coins get stuck or fall out over the wrapper, slide all the coins out and repeat the process. This will happen less and less often as you practice., Place a finger on each end of the filled wrapper and move the coins from side to side until there is an equal amount of space on each end. Fold down each end of the wrapper to form a closed end.


For flat coin wrappers, fold the two creased edges down over the coin, then fold the two remaining points down over them. Repeat with the other side.

, Pick up another pile, form it into a stack, and pour it into the next wrapper. As you continue, you'll find this process getting easier and more automatic, allowing you to simultaneously hold a conversation, listen to a podcast, or perform some other task that doesn't use your hands.

Use a coin-counting machine at a supermarket or your bank.,
Buy a coin-sorting machine.,
Measure your change collection's value by weight.",How to Roll Coins2," Many large stores have coin-counting machines, which rapidly count inserted mixed coins and returns paper money. However, these usually charge you a percentage of your total coin value as a fee, or gives you full value only in the form of a gift certificate to certain retailers. Certain banks have similar services, but usually only for customers.


In Canada or the eastern U.S., even non-customers can use the coin-counting machines at BMO (Bank of Montreal) or TD Bank, although there may be fees.Find the nearest location of a BMO coin-counting service here.

, Coin-sorting machines for home use separate coins of different types into their own stack, or even into prepared paper wrappers. These range from a stack of cheap plastic trays with different sized holes, to machines that cost several hundred dollars or euros, and sort the machine in fast or visually appealing ways.


Cheap, electronic coin-counting machines may jam after a few uses.Look for reviews online before buying one.

, Because coins are minted with a precise size and composition of metals, each one weighs a certain, predictable amount. You can estimate the value of a mixed coin collection using CoinCalc.com for euros or for U.S. coinage, or separate them by type and weight them for a more accurate result:


One pound of quarters is worth $20. One pound of dimes is worth $20. One pound of nickels is worth about $4.50, and one pound of pennies is worth about $1.80.One kilogram of two-euro coins is worth about €235. One kilo of one-euro coins is worth about €133. One kilo of 50-cent euro coins is worth about €64. A kilo of 20-cent coins is worth about €35, a kilo of 10-cent coins is worth about €24, a kilo of 5-cent coins is worth about €13, a kilo of two-cent coins is worth about €6.67, and a kilo of one-cent coins is worth about €4.35.In the United Kingdom, banks will weigh bags of coins for you.

Is the coin uncirculated, and how can you tell?,
Will a dealer pay you premium for the coin in the future?,
Has the coin ever been re-struck?,
Does the coin have a low mintage (meaning not many were made)?,
Is the coin over-valued or under-valued?,
Is the coin over-graded?,
Was the coin minted prior to 1934?,
Is the dealer reputable or well capitalized?,
How do you grade a coin?,
How does the industry define a rare coin's condition?",How to Buy Rare Collectible Coins," The much-prized 1927-D $20 is one of the rarest collector coins because most were destroyed before they were released into circulation. Uncirculated coins are particularly valuable. But how can you determine an uncirculated coin just by looking at it?


One way to tell is by asking: would you expect an uncirculated, 100 year-old coin to be dull with tiny scratches, or bright and shiny? If your answer is ""dull with tiny scratches"", then congratulations - you're a natural!
In its original condition, an old coin tends to be dull and hazy and may have a few tiny scratches. If the coin is bright, shiny and has no scratches then this probably indicates that the coin has been buffed or cleaned.
Remember: a shiny coin attracts buyers looking for the wrong thing. Eye-appeal is important, but old coins should be purchased in their original condition, and not cleaned-up.;
, Almost all old coins carry collectible premiums. However, there are many coins being wrongly promoted as collectible, which a dealer won't necessarily pay you a premium for.

, Confusingly, in some instances, coins have been reproduced by a country using an old design cast.


For instance, Swiss and French franc were produced in the 1940s using an old die cast, and bearing an older date.
In Austria, Ducats bearing the date 1915 are currently being reproduced. And, of course, mistaken or dishonest dealers are offering them as rare old coins for a premium.
And so the problem emerges: no-one knows the true population of the coins made with that date, nor how to tell the old from the new. So what can you do? The answer is: keep your ear to the ground and pay attention to industry news. In today's internet and information-saturated age, once a coin is found to be illegitimate the world and his wife will quickly know about it.

, A rare coin doesn't necessarily have to be ""rare"" by population, but it should be scarce. So, although many US coins were made in big populations, what really makes a coin scarce is the condition it has survived in.


The reported mintage figure for the 1927-D $20 gold piece was about 180,000 pieces - fairly high. Yet it ranks as one of the all-time rarities in the series because most of the 1927-Ds were destroyed before they were released into circulation.
On the other hand, the 1913-D $20 had yet small mintage of 34,000 pieces. But there is little or no premium attached to these coins because almost the entire mintage survived.
Although, if a coin is in great original condition and has also originated from a small population, then you are looking at a seriously collectible buy.

, During the Y2K crisis, many dealers promoted cheap double eagle coins as great future investments, then priced just $80 or $100 above their gold value. Collectors bought them as bargain investments preferable to pricier uncirculated double eagles. These buyers were duped: after Y2K, it was discovered that many of the coins were worth little more than their melt value. So, if you are looking for less-expensive buy, keep an eye out for old and uncirculated coins with sizes and premiums similar to modern fractional bullion coins. This will help you spot good, appreciating coins.

, All too often, coin dealers will shirk the responsibility for the accuracy of coin gradings - that is, to value the coin by analyzing its surface preservation, strike, luster and eye-appeal (see below). Typically, they will refer to the current grading service standards. This can pose a problem, and can work against market trends. Coin grading standards can change or loosen-up in order to introduce more coins to the market. The opposite scenario is that there may be no demand for the coin.


Keep an eye out for dealers that respond to changing market trends - particularly ones who will guarantee to buy-back the coins at the same grade they sold them to you.

, The question particularly applies to US coins. In 1934, the US stopped minting coins as legal tender as ordered by President Franklin D Roosevelt, to take currency out of the hands of the public during the depression.


Numismatic experts agree that only 2% of US coins minted prior to 1934 are available on the coin market today.
Ninety-five percent of these coins were melted down by the US after being confiscated form the public, with others destroyed in private industry meltdowns, or simply lost.
As a collector, you can be sure of the rarity of your purchase thanks to regular figures published by the Professional Coin Grading Service (PCGS) and Numismatic Guarantee Corporation (NGC).

, In the United States alone, there are currently around 5,000 coin dealers. Only a handful of them are reputable and established with the ability to give you the best service and advice.


Research your dealer thoroughly before you do business with them, through their history, and other collector's feedback.
In the UK, Companies House (companies-house.gov.uk/info) offers free information on organizations date of incorporation, registered address, whether their accounts and returns are up-to-date and it has a list of disqualified directors.
The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has a section of its website dedicated to warning about scams (dti.gov.uk/ccp/scams/page1.htm).

, Here are the four factors taken into account when grading a coin:


Surface preservation: analysts look for bag marks, hairlines from cleaning or mishandling and other perfections (mint caused or man-made), their severity and their location on the coin's surface.
Strike: or the sharpness and completeness of detail in the coin's design. The normal characteristics of the coin's age, type and mint mark (or issue) are taken into account.
Luster: or the brilliance, cartwheel, sheen and contrast of the coin. Again, each issue's characteristics are considered. Evidence of cleaning, retoning or friction is also examined.
Eye-appeal: that is, the aesthetic appeal that results from the attractiveness of the coin's toning, the balance of the coin and the combination of all the coin's qualities.
Generally, surface preservation is considered the most important of the above four grading factors, with the other three equal in value and about half as important as surface grading.

, For US coins, the industry uses a 70-point numerical grading scale to define the condition (or grade) of a rare coin. Mint State (MS) coins were struck for general circulation. Proof (PR) coins were specifically struck for coin collectors. Coins graded MS63 or PR63, or higher, are usually recommended for purchase because they a) have shown the best rates of appreciation, and b) are more attractive.

Recognize mint state coins (MS). These are uncirculated coins of very high quality.
Look for almost uncirculated coins (AU). Many times, if a coin is in great condition but the light of the coin reflects differently from the high points of the coin as opposed to the lower points of the coin, then the coin is usually AU.
Identify Extremely Fine (XF or EF) coins. These coins have wear that is easy to see, but they still have their mint luster.
Recognize Very Fine (VF) coins. All of the major features of these coins will be intact, but the minor features such as hair detail and feathers will be worn.
Look for Fine coins (F). Fine coins have few details, but the original design is largely intact.
Identify Very Good (VG) coins. VG coins have a raised rim, but the details of the design may be lacking in detail.
Recognize Good (G) coins. These coins have a legible date and mint mark but do not have to have full rims.
Look for Almost Good (AG) coins. These coins will have a date that may be tough to identify. You will be able to see the outlines of the design.
Identify Fair (Fair) coins. These coins are identifiable as being a certain denomination but not much more. They may be bent or have holes.
Recognize Basal State (Basal) coins. The lump of metal is identifiable as a coin.

Never back down!",How to Be a Coin Dealer," If you are already well-vested in the hobby, beginning a business as a dealer may be as simple as hanging up a shingle over your own collection. However, if you're looking to turn your hobby to a long-term, profitable business, you need to be willing to invest time and money in the foundation. Start with a company name, business cards, and a website.;
, If your bookshelves are not already lined with books on coins, becoming a dealer may be an unrealistic business model for you. Books such as The Official Redbook: A Guide Book of United States Coins; The Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards of United States Coins, and the latest edition of U.S. Coin Digest are probably already staples of your coin library. However, you should also subscribe to magazines. Krause Publications publishes Coin World, Coins Magazine and Numismatic News, all of which are worth taking a look at.

, Before you can sell coins, you need to understand what will sell. Understanding coin value means knowing what is rare and what is in demand. While all numismatists want to get their hands on error coins or a 1969-S Lincoln penny, setting realistic sights is important.

, Grading is about the condition of the coins and, if you do not understand the full worth of the coins with which you will be dealing, you will never be a coin dealer. The grading book in Step 2 is certainly a start, but nothing can replace hands-on training. Practice grading coins new to your collection against coins for which you already know the grade.

, Purchase from coin and antique auctions and from fellow coin dealers. Once you have a good handle on what the buying public wants, buy what you can afford. Buy what sells.

, Place advertisements in coin magazines and online (in places like eBay and Craig's List) to gather inventory and clients. Attend coin shows, join online coin blogs, and put yourself and your company out in front of the public. Consult the American Numismatic Association for upcoming events and information on coins and publications.

, Take orders for specific coins when you can, and use your connections to satisfy your clients' wants.

, If you want success in an industry that sometimes includes unsavory participants, being honest about your product will guarantee you repeat customers. Being a coin dealer means cultivating relationships with your vendors and your clients.

Know what years proof sets are available for.,
Know the types of proof sets that are available.,
Look for the highest coin grades.,
Look for slabbed or cameo sets whenever possible.,
Buy from reputable coin dealers.",How to Buy Proof Sets," After allowing collectors to purchase proof coins and occasional proof sets from it, the United States Mint began marketing proof sets from its Philadelphia branch to coin collectors in 1936. Proof sets were available until 1942, when World War II forced a temporary end to their minting. Production resumed in 1950, then ended again in 1964. ""Special mint sets"" were issued for the next 3 years, then proof sets were issued again, this time from the San Francisco mint, from which they continue to be issued.


Because they were issued as special requests, proof sets from years prior to 1936 are extremely rare.;
, The types of proof sets that are available depend on the year the coins were issued.


U.S. proof sets from 1936 to 1942, from 1950 to 1972, and from 1982 to 1998 include the cent, nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar.
Proof sets from 1973 to 1981 include the coins above, along with the Eisenhower or Susan B. Anthony dollar.
Prestige Proof sets, sold from 1983 to 1997, included commemorative coins, while sets sold since 1999 include the 5 state quarters issued that year, and Legacy Proof sets, sold in 2004 and 2005, included the nickel designs commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
The metal content depends on the year of issue. Proof sets issued prior to 1965 featured dimes, nickels, and quarters with 90 percent silver content. The special mint sets issued from 1965 to 1967 included dimes, nickels, and quarters clad with 40 percent silver. Proof sets issued since 1992 are available in either silver or the metals used for circulation coins.

, Coins are graded according to the Sheldon scale, with the coins in poorest condition graded as ""1"" and those in the best condition graded as ""70."" Proof coins also include the prefix ""PR"" or ""PF"" in the grade to indicate they are proof coins. You want coins in the proof set to grade at least PR 60 or better, although the top grade of PR 70 is exceedingly rare and in some cases nonexistent for some proof set coins.

, Older proof sets originally came wrapped in cellophane, while proof sets issued since 1966 come in hard plastic cases called slabs. These cases better protect the coins in the set from damage than did the cellophane. In some cases, older proof sets have been transferred from cellophane to plastic, but the coins in such sets may have discoloration from fingerprints, breathing, or tobacco smoke.


Proof sets issued from 1950 to 1954 came in square boxes, with the coins in cellophane holders wrapped in tissue. Proof sets issued from 1955 through 1964 came in cellophane holders inside sealed brown envelopes, while the special mint sets of 1965 replaced the brown envelope with an unsealed white envelope.

, Recent-issue U.S. proof sets can be bought directly from the United States Mint, either from its website or by telephone. Older proof sets can be purchased through either brick-and-mortar or online coin dealers, or through online auction sites such as eBay.


Check the dealer's experience in selling coins, as well as his or her readiness to answer questions. For those selling coins through auction sites, check the feedback ratings as well as any positive or negative comments left by previous buyers.

Put 1 tsp (5 g) of salt into 1/4 c (2 oz) of vinegar.,
Place your pennies in the vinegar or the lemon juice.,
Leave the pennies for around five minutes in the glass of vinegar or lemon juice.,
Take the pennies out, and wash them off.",How to Clean Pennies1," For many pennies, one tablespoon (15 g) of salt in 1/2 cup (4 oz) of vinegar will get the job done. Stir the mixture to dissolve the salt.









If you don't have vinegar, use lemon or even orange juice. Copper oxide (the gunk on your pennies) dissolves in weak acid, and that's just what all three of these liquids are.;
, Make sure they are not directly on top of each other.








, If they're extra dirty or if you're cleaning a lot simultaneously, give them a few more minutes for good measure.









For those especially nasty pennies, scrub them with a scrubber or toothbrush after they've been resting in the solution for a bit.

, Let them dry for around five minutes so they will no longer be wet. They will now sparkle.









If you don't wash them off, a blue-green sheen will develop on your pennies. That's what happens when the copper, oxygen, and chlorine (from the salt) combine (called malachite)."

, For the record, with this method, you may be able to smell the ketchup on the penny when you are finished. Tabasco, on the other hand, may leave an orange tint. However, they will be clean!







, If you have a toothbrush handy (preferably your roommate's), after the three minutes are up, scrub the penny, working into the little ridges.








, And if you used your roommate's toothbrush, wash that off, too!









If the pennies are clean, but not shiny, mix a paste of baking soda and water and rub into the pennies. Wash it off and tada!

Warm the clay with body heat.,
Warm the clay using a heat source.,
Roll the clay in your hands.,
Roll with a rolling pin.,
Hit the clay with a mallet.,
Knead the clay.",How to Soften Polymer Clay1," If your clay is only slightly hard, you may be able to soften it just by warming and kneading it with your hands. Before you start kneading the clay, hold the clay in your hands to warm it. You can also warm it using the heat of your body by sitting on top of it.Warmth helps to revitalize the clay. If your clay is only a little bit hard, you may be able to restore its softness just using body heat.
No matter what method you use to soften clay, always warm it first.;
, If the clay is especially hard, you may need to use a heat source to soften the clay. Lay a hot water bottle over your clay for twenty minutes to help soften it.You can also use a heat lamp, but be sure to not heat the clay over body temperature. This can cause the clay to start to bake, which will make it unusable.
Additionally, you can put the clay in the microwave for 10 second spurts until it is warm.

, Once the clay has softened, roll it between your hands in a snake shape, then roll it into a ball. Rolling the clay creates friction, which helps to soften it.You can also cut the clay into small pieces, then roll it.

, If the clay is still too hard to roll with your hands, you may to use more force. Lay the piece of clay on a clean cutting board or on the counter, then press down on the clay to flatten it out as much as you can. Then roll the clay out with a rolling pin. After you roll it out, it should be warm enough to roll with your hands.

, If your clay is too hard to roll out with a rolling pin, you will need a large amount of force. Break the clay up into as small of pieces as you can, then place the clay pieces in a sealed plastic bag. Wrap the bag with a cloth and put it on the floor or on the cement or pavement outside.Use a rubber mallet to pound on the clay for several minutes. Using the mallet will break up the clay and add friction which will make it softer.
After you have used the rubber mallet, take the clay out of the bag and roll it with your hands into a ball.

, After you have rolled the clay, knead the clay with your hands on a counter just as you would with dough. Use as much force as you need to pull apart and reshape the clay.Kneading the clay ensures that you handle the entire surface area of the clay.
You can also use a clay-kneading machine if you don’t want to knead by hand.

Add in a liquid diluent.,
Use a bar of clay softener.,
Add in liquid clay.,
Add mineral oil.,
Rub the clay with petroleum jelly.,
Combine hard clay with fresh clay.",How to Soften Polymer Clay2," Liquid diluent is one product on the market that softens unworkable clay. Many diluents are manufactured by the companies that make polymer clay, and they are made specifically for rejuvenating old clay.


Use liquid diluents if warming and kneading the clay doesn’t work to soften it.
Add in liquid diluents a drop at a time as you knead the clay. Adding too much can make the clay mushy.
Liquid diluents can be used as a glue, and therefore may add stickiness to your clay. If your clay is becoming too sticky, wrap it in a paper towel to absorb some of the stickiness., There are also several clay softeners that come in bar form. Instead of being liquids that you add, the bars are made of a neutral mixing compound that help your clay become more workable.


Use one part of solid clay softener to five parts of clay. Warm the clay, then add the bar clay softener and knead until the clay and the clay softener are mixed.
Bar clay softeners are whitish colored, and therefore work best with highly saturated clay. Be aware that adding too high a ratio of bar clay softener can dilute the color of the clay.

, Liquid polymer clay is another material that can be used to make hard clay more pliable. Use liquid polymer in a similar way as you would the diluent, adding it drop by drop and kneading the clay in between drops until the clay has reached the right consistency.Try to use uncolored liquid clay so that it doesn’t affect the color of the clay.
You can also use tinted liquid clay, but it will slightly change the original color.

, Even though mineral oil is not made specifically for helping to soften clay, it does work wonders to soften and improve the texture of polymer clay. Add in a drop of mineral oil at a time, kneading in between each drop until the clay is workable., Petroleum jelly is a common household product that you can use if you don’t have access to commercial clay softeners. To use petroleum jelly, dab a small amount on your fingers and rub it into the clay. Then knead the clay to mix in the petroleum jelly. Keep adding more until you reach the optimal consistency., Another option that you have is to simply tack on fresh clay to the hardened clay, then knead the clays together. The more new clay that you add, the softer the combined clay becomes. Be sure to add clay of the same color unless you don’t mind the colors mixing.Knead the clay with your hands until the clay feels consistent throughout.

"
Chop the clay with a knife.,
Place the clay and a softening agent in a food processor.,
Grind in ten second spurts.,
Remove the clay and combine the pieces.,
Knead the clay in your hands.",How to Soften Polymer Clay3," If you are working with very hard clay, you may need to use a food processor to really break down the clay and warm it up. Before you put the clay pieces into the food processor, first use a sharp knife or cleaver to chop the clay into the smallest pieces that you can.

, Once you have chopped the clay as much as you can, take the chopped pieces and put them in a food processor. If you wish, add a few drops of diluent or liquid polymer clay to the food processor as well to further help soften the clay. Then place the lid on the food processor.You can also use a coffee grinder, but you may have to grind in several batches.
Try to get a separate bowl and blade for mixing clay because unless you clean them extremely thoroughly it is not advisable to use the same ones for food and clay.

, Use the highest setting on your food processor to grind the clay. Grinding the clay will separate it into smaller pieces and soften it, making the clay easier to work with. Grind for one to three minutes, until the clay is soft.

, After the clay is soft, take it out of the food processor. You may need to use a spoon to scrape the sides and get the clay out of the nooks and crannies of the food processor. Once you get all the clay out, press the pieces together to combine them.

, After you have chopped the clay in the food processor, it should be soft and pliable. Knead the clay in your hands to completely blend the pieces together. It should now be soft and ready for use!

,,,, Be sure not to staple too close to the coin because the metal can leach chemicals into the coin, and the coin can get scratched when it's being removed. At the same time, you don't want to put the staple so close to the edge that it doesn't hold it in place strongly enough.
• Even if your coin holder is self-sealing, the adhesive can wear out over time and cause the holder to pop open, exposing and possibly losing your coin. Use stapling in addition to the adhesive, or consider not using the adhesive at all if you're concerned about its potential damage to the coin.
•Use a pair of pliers to gently squeeze and flatten the two prongs of the staple that get folded at the back of the coin holder. This will ease sliding the coin holders in and out of the pockets of 8.5 by 11 inch clear plastic coin holder sheets.

Remove the air-dry clay from the bag.,
If needed, return the air-dry clay to the bag.,
Remove the clay again and knead.",How to Revive Dry Clay1," Knead it, bend it, and twist it to see if it will revive of its own accord. The heat and moisture from your hands may be enough to bring your clay back to life. Give it about 5 minutes of consistent movement and kneading to determine if this is the case.








In some instances, your clay will require more than your own natural oils and warmth. If this is the case, move on to the next step.
If working the clay with your hands is enough to give it new vigor, make sure you store it in a sealed, air-tight bag to prevent drying out again in the future.;
, Although most clay comes in large plastic bags, most of these bags do not have a means of sealing. Remove your clay from the bag it came in and place it in a large, sealable plastic bag.









If you do not have a bag large enough to fit all of your clay, cut your clay into manageable clumps and practice this method one small piece at a time.

, Using your hand or a spray bottle, apply a small amount of water to the clay. Don't add too much, or the clay will become sticky and unusable.








For easier clean-up, you can work with your clay in a sink or tub.

, Let the water and clay sit for a few minutes to absorb the moisture. Double check the seal to make sure it is air-tight and none of the moisture is able to leak out.









Keep it away from heat or direct sunlight during this process, as both can cause moisture to evaporate.

, After waiting 5-10 minutes, open the bag and remove the clay, checking the moisture content as you do so. Does it have more spring to it? Twist and knead your clay, checking for easy movement and manipulation.








If your clay has returned to a usable state, you are done!

, After returning your clay to a sealed bag, add a few more drops of water. Seal and set aside once more, leaving the water to seep into the clay for up to 30 minutes.









Once more, avoid heat and sunlight in this step. A bathroom is a great moist environment to allow your clay to sit in.

, If the clay has become malleable, success! Continue to store it in a sealed bag or container to prevent it from drying out in the future. If you cannot get to your clay regularly, consider storing it in a moist environment, such as the bathroom or kitchen, to keep moisture contained.









If the clay remains hard or difficult to work with, it may be past the point of saving, and will need to be replaced.

Do not stir the clay as it soaks. Stirring will interfere with the soaking process and will not allow the porous nature of your clay to properly take in water.

, Placing a towel or other cover on top of your container to keep out curious pets or pesky dust particles, give the clay 2-3 days to thoroughly soak up all of the water. At the end of the three days, the clay should look like a handful of mush.









If your clay does not seem to be affected after 3 days, allow it to soak for an additional day, until it begins to loosen up.

, At the end of the three days (or when the clay is moist), begin to remove the water. Because the clay will be extremely mushy in texture, you will not be able to turn the basin upside-down to drain the water. Instead, you can remove water using a ladle or siphon water out using a tool such as a turkey baster.









The tools you use may be at risk for coming into contact with clay. If you are not comfortable with the possibility of ruining the ladle or baster, purchase an additional set for this purpose.

, Remove the clay from the basin using your hands and place it atop a concrete slab, plaster slab, canvas, or denim surface, making sure your surface is clean first. Spread the mixture 2-3 inches (5-8 cm) thick to dry, smoothing your hands over the top of the clay to prevent uneven drying.








To help your clay dry out faster, you can place a fan beside it as it dries.

, Once your clay has dried, seal it in proper storage containers, making sure air cannot reach the clay and dry it out a second time.








You can simply place your clay in a sealed container once it has hardened or you can roll it into coils and place your coils into plastic wrap or sealed plastic bags.
The length of time you expect to store your clay will play a role in how you store it. If you plan to store it for an extended period of time, tight plastic storage is the preferred method.

Gather all of the pieces of putty or dough.,
Rinse the dough for 10-15 seconds.,
Knead the dough for 30 seconds.,
Rinse the dough a second time.,
Knead a second time.,
Repeat the process.",How to Revive Dry Clay3," Old children’s putty often separates into multiple dried, hardened chunks. Gather all of the pieces you want to moisturize and place them in your hand, molding them into a ball as much as is possible.








, Place your ball of clay beneath a steady stream of water for 10-15 seconds--or longer, if the dough is completely hardened. Hold it carefully in your hands, as extremely dried-out clay may begin to come apart and could fall down the drain.









Alternatively, you can fill a cup with water and pour the water directly onto the clay.
To prevent clogging the drain, lay down a drain trap to catch any runaway pieces of clay.

, Place the dough on a clean, non-stick surface, such as a granite counter or porcelain sink. Work the dough through your hands, keeping all pieces of the dough together.







, Take the kneaded dough and run it under the tap (or cup) for another 10-20 seconds, kneading the dough as you do so, allowing the water to reach all pieces of the clay. Squeeze the dough through your fingers to help the water penetrate the clay thoroughly.








If the clay persists in being dry or unworkable, add an additional 10 seconds to your underwater kneading time.

, Place your dough back onto the nonstick surface and knead once more, this time for 60-90 seconds. Make sure you work the clay through your hands, as well, as the oils and moisture from your hands can help bring the dough back to life.








, Continue the process of wetting and kneading until the dough has reached the desired consistency. Once it has reached the desired consistency, be sure to store it in a sealed, airtight container to prevent drying out in the future.









If the clay does not become usable again after repeating the steps above 4-5 times, it may no longer be viable.

Choose the type and size clayboard you wish to use for the painting.,
Sketch the basic outlines and main shapes of your painting with a pencil, if you desire.,
Start with a thin coat of watercolor paint with a paintbrush for background colors.,
Apply another coat of acrylic or watercolor paint to block out main shapes in your painting.

,
Allow the paint to dry.

,
Use an etching needle or scriber to etch details into your painting.,
Brush the next layer of acrylic or watercolor paint onto your clayboard, painting over the etched areas.,
Continue this process until you have completed your painting.",How to Paint on Clayboard,"


Smooth clayboard allows you to create your own texture with the paint, while textured or rough surfaces gives the paint something to grab onto and results in a different look. There is no right or wrong type of clayboard surface, it is simply personal preference.
Just like using a regular stretched canvas, you need to determine the size of the clayboard before you begin. This is an important step to remember for watercolor artists who are used to cutting and cropping watercolor paper to the size of their final painting.;
, Since clayboard is manufactured to be ready to paint and you do not need to prepare the board for painting, your pencil lines will show up as a guide when you begin to paint on clayboard.

, If you choose to use acrylic paint, remember that acrylic can take on both translucent and opaque properties, so you must thin out your paint to create an underlying, translucent color.

,,, When you scratch through the paint, the etched lines will show up white, which makes it easy to see the details you are creating.

, The etched lines begin to add texture and depth to the painting.

, You can finish your painting with etched lines that you want to leave white as a contrast to your painting, or let the etched lines simply be colored details in your painting.

Prepare your clay.Good clay is soft enough to be worked with by hand straight out of the box or bag.,
Use the pinch method.Probably the most ancient and easy way to mold clay is by pinching it with your fingers.,
Try coiled construction.Forming objects from coils of clay allows more versatility, but also requires nothing more than your hands.,
Form slabs.You can also form clay objects from flat sheets of clay in various shapes.,
Use an extruder.An extruder is a tool that can make more uniform coils and/or produce them more quickly.",How to Mold Clay1," However, by kneading the clay you will make it more pliable and remove any air bubbles and debris. This process of kneading and preparing clay is known as wedging.Place a lump of clay on a porous surface, such as concrete or canvas.
Using your palms, press and roll the lump toward you.
Pick up the clay, set it back down, and again press and roll it toward you.
Repeat this process until the lump of clay is uniform in consistency (perhaps 50 times).;
, Once your clay has been wedged, press and pull at it with your fingers to form it into a desired shape. For instance, to shape a simple bowl using the pinch method:


Take a lump of your clay and roll into a ball.
Set the ball down on your work surface, pushing it down slightly to hold it in place.
Make a small impression in the center of your ball. This will make the opening of the bowl.
Pull the clay horizontally away from the center hole to widen the bowl.
Pinch the sides of the clay and pull them upwards to form the sides of the bowl.
Continue to pinch and pull until the bowl is the desired size and shape.

, Start with a lump of clay that has been wedged properly.


Separate the clay into several smaller lumps of about the same size.
Take each lump and roll it into a ball.
Using your palms, push down on each ball and roll it back and forth. This process will start to form a long thin coil.
Move your palms horizontally and continue rolling each coil to make it longer.
Stop when your coils are the desired thickness. They can be thicker or thinner depending on the form you want to make (use smaller coils to make a thinner-walled bowl, for instance).
Shape a coil into a desired shape. For instance, to make a round bowl, shape the coil into a circle, and pinch the ends together to close it.
Stack coils on top of each other to make the object higher.
Use progressively small coils to close off an object (for instance, to make the bottom of a bowl). You can also start with a slab of clay to form the bottom of an object (such as a small flat circle to serve as the bottom of a bowl).
Gently press on the coils to join them together and to smooth the sides of your object.

, Fuse the shapes together to make your object. For instance, to make a clay box:


Take a lump of wedged clay and roll it into a flat sheet using a rolling pin or similar tool.
Use a knife or semi-sharp object to cut slab into the shapes you desire. To make a box, cut the clay sheet into squares or rectangles of the same size.
You can also use another object as a guide when cutting shapes. For instance, take a square sheet of paper, lay it on your clay sheet, and cut the clay by tracing around the edges of the paper using a knife.
Once you have all of your shapes cut, score them by making many small cuts along their edge. This will create a good surface to fuse them together.
Set one scored edge against another. Gently press using your hands or a small tool to join them together and smooth the edge out.
Repeat until all of your shapes are joined together to make the object.

, Extruders can be purchased from ceramic supply stores and catalogues. Place a lump of wedged clay inside the extruder. Using a lever, you will then push at the clay to force it through an opening of a desired shape, such as a circle or square. This will form coils or slabs that you can use to shape into various objects.

The process of making a Polymer Stamp is a fairly easy once you learn the basics.,
Design the Negative The first step in making a polymer stamp is to create the negative.,
Print the Negative .The final step in creating the image is translating the image to transparency film (the type used for overhead projectors) which can be purchased from any office supply store.,
Setting up for Exposure Once the negative is created, you can start to prepare the exposure unit.,
Wash out the Stamp.,
Final Conditioning There are two ways to condition your finished stamp, depending on what you intend to use it for.",How to Make Polymer Clay Stamps," There are two pieces of equipment that you will need to make to expose your rubber stamps, although both are very simple to make. The first is the UV exposure light. If you think you might be doing a lot of rubber stamp making I would invest in a fluorescent light fixture with UV (black light) bulbs to fit. You will need to attach two 6"" x 6"" wood boards to the side of the light to raise it 4"" off of the table surface. Some light fixtures will need to have a cord attached, which can easily be done by cutting a 6' extension cords female end off and direct wiring to the fixture. To make the light fixture easy to use a on/off switch may be wired to the light as well to make turning off the light between exposures easier. Another solution for those who don't want to wire their light fixture is to simply purchase a clamp light and hang it 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the tabletop. They come with cords attached and a turn of button on the top of the fixture. You can purchase a flood style black light bulb to fit the fixture.The second piece of equipment is the glass exposure plates. These are simply two matching sheets of 8"" x 8"" single pain clear glass , with the edges wrapped in electrical tape to keep your hands clear of sharp edges. Along two parallel edges of the taped plates lay magnetic tape on both sides. This will hold the plates together and keep them from shifting during the exposure process.;
, This will allow UV light only to penetrate the polymer where you choose. To create the negative, first either select or draw a black and white image that has bold lines or shapes. The reason for this is fine lines do not survive the washout process well, and will not make a strong impression in clay. If you are only looking to use your stamp like a traditional rubber stamp you can get away with having finer detail on the stamp. Your image must be strong black and white contrast, no grayscale or shading. Once you have your image you need to translate that into a negative. That means making the black parts white and the white parts black. This is easily done in most graphics programs, and it is usually listed as an “invert colors” command. You can also design you image in negative format by hand if that appeals to you more, although it is a much more time consuming process.

, If you are creating your image by hand then you will need to paint the negative space of your design with opaque paint. Paint pens work very well for this. If you are going to print your negative from a computer, make sure you use Laser Transparency Film in a laser printer of the negative will not be opaque enough to block the excess light. If you try to use regular transparency film in a laser printer you will melt the film to the print head, a very expensive mistake.

, It is a good idea to have everything laid out and ready because the photopolymer is light reactive, and will set up quickly once exposed, even to ambient light. Place the light fixture on a level surface covered in butcher paper, or vinyl tablecloth to protect the surface. In one of the liquid containers, add two cups warm water and 1 tbsp. washout concentrate and set aside. In the other shallow container add 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cool water, and set aside. Cut the negative out of the larger sheet leaving at least 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) black border around the edge of the image. Place the negative down on the inside cover of one half of the glass sheets at surround the image with damming tape, leaving small gaps at any edges to let excess photopolymer to ease out of the edges. Trim a piece of substrate to the same size and the negative and set aside.

, It is now time to start the washout process.Immediately separate the two halves of the glass and peel the negative off of the polymer. Always peel the negative off the polymer not the substrate off or the stamp will not have a good backing for washout. Place the polymer image in the washout solution and gently scrub with fine bristle brush or soft toothbrush until all of the excess liquid polymer is dissolved from the stamp surface. Rinse in water to remove the last of the washout solution. At this time you can trim off the excess hardened polymer. Place the stamp in the plain water container and set under the UV light and expose for 10 minutes. This fully hardens the stamp, and makes it less tacky.

, If you use your stamp to make impressions in soft clay then simply dust your stamp with talc or baby powder to separate it from the clay, and keep it from getting tacky. If you intend to ink you stamp use a pink eraser to rough up the surface of the image. This allows the ink to stick to the stamp long enough to make the image. Your stamp is now ready to use and enjoy.

Set up your wheel.Potter’s wheels may be either manual or electric.,
Prepare your clay.Wedge your clay by setting it on a porous surface and pulling it toward you as you push down.,
Attach your clay to the wheel.Take a lump of clay that has been formed in to a rough ball shape.,
Center the clay.Using dry hands, tap at the clay to move it to the very center of the bat.,
Wet your hands.Once your clay has been centered, it is ready to be molded.,
Shape a rough form.Start running the wheel at a higher speed.,
Open the clay.Place your fingers in the middle of your lump as it spins.,
Raise the clay.Hold your fingers or another tool against the clay as it spins, working from both the inside and outside of the opening.,
Remove the clay from the wheel.Clear away any excess clay from the bat of the wheel.",How to Mold Clay2," Prepare the wheel before molding your clay by:


Setting the right rotation direction (counter-clockwise if you are right-handed, clockwise if you are left-handed).
Making sure the splash pan is installed. This will catch any clay that falls or spins off as you shape the clay.
Adjusting the height of the wheel so that is comfortable for you to sit at and use.
Plugging your wheel into a power source, if applicable.
Checking to make sure that your wheel spins properly before using.

, Repeat this process until your clay is pliable and uniform in consistency.

, Place it firmly in the middle of the wheel surface (known as the bat).

, Start moving your wheel slowly, and tap at the lump of clay to make sure that it is uniformly in the center, with no large portions sticking out.

, When using a wheel, it is important to work with wet hands. This helps form a slick surface on the clay (known as a slurry or slip) as it turns, making it easier to mold. Keep a bowl of water near your wheel that you can dip your hands into as needed while you mold the clay.

, Wrap your hands around the lump and push slightly as it spins. This will shape the clay into the initial form. With a bit of practice, you will learn how to push the clay to get it into the shape you desire.


To make a relatively tall object, like a mug, keep the clay close to the center as you push at it. This will force the clay upwards.
To make a relatively wide object, like a low bowl, first push the clay slightly forward to help smooth the sides. Then, push downwards as the clay spins to make the form wider.

, This will create an initial impression. Push and pull with your fingers, whole hand, or a tool in order to get the opening into the size and shape needed for your object.


Keep the opening narrow for a relatively tall object, such as a mug or jug.
Pull at the clay to widen the opening for objects such as bowls and plates.

, This will thin the sides of the clay form. Keep working until you reach the desired shape.


For tall forms, like jugs or mugs, you may want to pull slightly upwards.

, Then slide a stretched out wire or a spatula underneath the bottom of your object. This will separate it from the wheel. Using a spatula or another flat surface, gently lift the object off of the wheel and leave it in a safe place to dry.

Mix clays to improve consistency.Ceramic and art suppliers usually stock several kinds of clay.,
Keep your fingertips out of the clay when kneading.It is important to work with your palms when kneading clay.,
Don’t set the wheel speed too high.Start your wheel slowly.,
Anchor your arms.If your arms wobble as you shape the clay, the form will become warped or slide off-center.,
Keep your hands and the clay wet.If your hands or the clay become too dry while molding it, your form may become misshapen or ruined.,
Rewedge your clay if needed.If you are molding clay and something goes wrong, you can start over.,
Try different tools to raise and shape clay.Your hands and fingers alone are often enough to mold clay into desired forms.",How to Mold Clay3," You can mix various kinds of clay together if you find that a certain kind is too difficult to work with. For instance, add coarser clay to clay that is too sticky, or more pliable clay to another variety that is too coarse to work with.

, If you push at it with your fingertips, this can create impressions in the clay that can form air pockets as you continue to knead. These air pockets can ruin a form when you try to mold it.

, This helps to ensure that your clay is well-attached to the bat. As you shape and raise the form, take care not to spin the wheel so fast that it warps the clay. Setting an appropriate speed will also prevent your clay from flying off your wheel, ruining your project.

, To prevent this from happening, anchor your arms by holding your elbows against your knees as you work. Keep your arms firm as you shape and raise the clay.

, The goal is to keep a wet, slick surface as you mold the clay. Make sure to wet your hands before starting to mold the clay, and wet them again any time they start to become dry.

, However, you must remove the clay from your wheel or work surface and wedge it again. Knead in more clay if you need to alter its consistency (for instance, if it is too wet).

, However, you may find that various tools make molding easier, or just give you more options. For instance, using a sponge instead of just your fingers to raise clay on a wheel may allow you to make smoother or thinner sides. As you practice, don’t be afraid to experiment with all sorts of objects to help mold your clay.

Assemble all of your supplies.,
Loosen up the polymer clay.,
Pierce the ball of polymer clay right down the middle with your toothpick.,
Lay your bead on your baking sheet.,
Repeat these steps with all of the colors of clay you have.,
Make marbled beads.,
Make a two-sided multicolor bead.,
Follow the baking directions given on the wrapper of the clay.,
Remove the beads from the oven and let them cool before assembling your necklace.,
Assemble your necklace.,
Put on your brand new necklace!

",How to Make Polymer Clay Jewelry1," You will need several colors of polymer clay, a toothpick, a pan that can go in the oven (that will only be used for polymer clay, not food), a piece of string, and a needle that can be threaded onto the string.


Polymer clay is available at all craft supply stores and easily available online as well.;
, Polymer clay needs to be worked and warmed up a little bit before it can be easily manipulated.Cut off a small piece of the first color you want to use, about the size of a marble. Roll it around in your hands, making it round and loosening it up.









If your clay is really hard, cut it up into small pieces with a knife. Lay the pieces on on a cutting board and add a drop of mineral oil. Now knead all the little pieces back together. The mineral oil should make it more pliable., Be careful that the ball keeps its round shape and that the hole made by the toothpick is big enough to get your needle through later.









Polymer clay does not really expand or contract when cooked, but bead holes may tend to shrink a bit. This means that you should make your bead holes a little bit bigger than your needle., Remember that the baking sheet you use will should not be used for baking food after it's used for baking polymer clay.

, Try to keep your beads all the same size, so that they look the same.

, Once you have practiced making beads of a single color, try mixing several colors together to create a marbled effect. Simply take small pieces of several colors and knead them together. However, be careful not to knead them too long or the colors will simply combine and create a new solid color.









Different brands of polymer clay may have different baking directions, so it's best to only combine polymer clays of the same brand., Roll each color into a long skinny tube, about a quarter inch wide and four inches long. Press all the tubes of color into each other, making one long roll. Roll out this larger roll a little bit, just to make sure that it is round. Then slice off marble size pieces and roll them into beads. Your finished bead should have two multicolored sides.









You can make a variety of patterns and designs by using this process. Try slicing thin round pieces off of your multicolor roll and then applying the flat sides of them to the surface of a single color bead (as made in the steps above). Once the surface is covered, smooth the surface out by rolling the bead lightly in your hands.

, Be sure to follow the directions carefully, as over baking or under baking your bead can damage them.


No matter what brand it is, it will smell up your kitchen a bit while baking. These fumes are not good for you. Be sure to open us some windows or turn on a vent to get proper ventilation.

, The beads need to be completely cool before you touch them. When they are still warm they will not be totally hard, so touching them could damage the surface.

, Thread your needle with the string you got. Then string the beads on, paying attention to any kind of color pattern you would like to make. Once all of your beads are on the string, take the needle off the end and tie the ends of the string off, making sure the loop you make is big enough to fit over your head.

Purchase several different colors of polymer clay.,
Choose some jewelry making accessories.,
Mix and blend colors.,
Sculpt your polymer clay.,
Add metal accessory pieces to your sculpted items before baking.,
Place your sculpted items on a foil covered cookie sheet.,
Bake the polymer clay items according to the package directions.,
Allow sculpted items to cool completely.",How to Make Polymer Clay Jewelry2," You'll want to choose colors with projects in mind. Polymer clay blends very well, so keep in mind that you can mix colors.


There are several different brands of polymer clay available. You may wish to purchase more than one brand to see which one you like best. Some are softer than others. Remember, however, that different brands may have different baking directions, so you may not want to mix them together.
You can also make your own polymer clay at home.

, You will need to plan what type of pendants you want to make. For a necklace pendant or several hanging earrings, you will need to purchase an oven-proof band holder. This is basically a piece of wire that you can stick into the clay before it is baked that is made to withstand the heat of the oven. This wire will have a loop the sticks out of the pendant, that way you can attach the pendant to a necklace string or chain or to earring wires.


You can find a wide variety of jewelry making tools and accessories at any craft store.

, Pick your favorite colors and blend them together just enough so that they create a marbled effect.









You can also mix colors together completely in order to make a brand new color. It might be fun to only buy red, yellow, and blue polymer clay and try to make other colors yourself by mixing them together.

, Using your fingers alone you can sculpt pendants, figurines, or beads. Begin with simple shapes, adding small pieces of clay on top of that to create a pattern.


Make unique shapes. There are no limits to what you can do with polymer clay. Try to make an abstract shape out of a variety of colors or a tiny version of your favorite animal. The options are endless on what you can make.
Try covering a square or circle of polymer clay with small dots of other colors of polymer clay. Once covered, smooth out the surface gently or leave it with a textured surface.
If you run out of ideas, try looking online for inspiration. There are a wide variety of websites that can give you ideas to start from.

, There are some accessories that need to be baked into the piece. Be sure anything you put in the oven is oven-proof.








, This protects both the pan and the back of the jewelry pieces.

, Most clays are baked at 275 degrees F (135 degrees C) for 20 to 25 minutes.

, You can lightly sand with extra fine paper if needed. If you are making a necklace, thread your necklace string or chain through the wire loop on your pendant. If you are making a pair of earrings, simply attach the earring wires you purchased to the loops coming out of the pendants.

Now when you pop it out, resist the temptation to jab it with a knife to see how hard it is.,
Make it look old.","How to Make Primitive Utensils, Pots and Pans Without Using Metal1"," You can do this by squeezing it for a minute or two. This helps because as the clay is heated, the molecules expand, which makes the clay softer and easier to work with.;
, You do this by lightly pressing while making circular waving motions with your hand on the clay. It doesn't have to be perfect, it will even itself out a little in the next step.

, Now, since this is primitive pottery NO POTTERY WHEELS, sorry! OK, now do something VERY sophisticated. ""Stab"" the clay with your thumb. Come on, really do it hard! But Be careful to leave at least half an inch thick bottom, or your bowl may break!

, Or you can make it taller by repeating this motion, but not very much, then pinching and pulling upwards. Don't exaggerate height nor width as the bowl may break. There must be enough clay in all areas to support itself!

, Just do what makes you happy!

, Just put the right temperature your package says, and cook for 15-20 minutes.

, The clay is softer when first out of the oven then when cooled down. The overall result will be harder if you pop it directly in the freezer when out of the oven. Do this immediately!

,


Use pale yellow paint as the base.
Then do your ""Tribal"" designs.
When finished, you can use the lighter to burn parts of the bowl. DO NOT PUT THE FLAME DIRECTLY ON THE BOWL! This will result in the bowl igniting.
Instead leave the flame an inch or two away until the area you're heating is light brown at the center. That's your bowl!

Condition any polymer clay until it's smooth and pliable.,
Roll the clay into a smooth ball between palms after conditioning.,
Put a release on the clay and/or the item to be molded if needed.,
Push the item being used to create the mold into a ball or a slab of raw clay.,
Gently remove the item from the clay.,
Place the raw clay mold on a metal baking tray or on another oven-safe carrier.,
Bake the clay in a preheated oven.,
Set a timer for 20 to 45 minutes depending on the thickness of the mold and the brand/line of clay used.,
Remove the hardened mold from the oven on its carrier and allow it to cool.,
Make as many molds as you want once you've gotten the hang of it.

,
Rigid or silicone molds can also be purchased already made.,
If you want, make casts from your molds with scrap clay then number the matching molds (""innies"") and casts (""outies"") on their back sides to keep matching molds and casts straight.,
Roll the clay into a smooth ball as above.,
Remove the cast from the mold.,
If you want, highlight or antique the casts.,
Use the casts in many ways (including casts from texture molds).,
If desired, the clay cast can be cut into another shape before baking.,
Follow the instructions for making regular molds as in the above method, but start with a flat sheet of clay for most texture molds.,
It will be best to place a sheet of paper or deli wrap, etc, under the clay sheet before continuing so the clay won't stick to the work surface later.,
Use a release, then press anything shallow but dimensional and at least somewhat firm into the clay sheet.,
Carefully separate the clay and texture material.,
Use part or all of the raw textured sheet in some way for a final piece and bake later.,To create a reverse mold, first make and bake a mold or a texture sheet.,Press new raw clay into or onto that mold to create its opposite.,
Separate the hardened clay from the raw clay, and bake the new clay.,
Cut two thick slabs of clay.,Roll over one wide side of each slab with a roller or jar to make it very flat.,
Dust the rolled-over side of one slab well with cornstarch or baby powder. ,
Press the item down into that side of the slab until it is about halfway into the clay.,
Remove the item from the first slab, and bake it.,
Heavily dust one side of the second slab (especially since polymer clay will bond to other polymer clay when heated if it's bare), then carefully press it down onto the first slab and snug all around the item as much as possible.,Cool, then separate the halves of the final mold and remove the item.,
To use the two-part mold later, experimentation may be necessary to find the right amount of raw clay for the mold, i.e., just enough to fill, but not enough to overfill, and the best shape of clay to use.,Do everything as above but instead of using two slabs, wrap a wad of clay (flat or any shape that works) halfway around the item, leaving the upper edges of the wad uneven or adding registration marks.,
Use a second wad of clay as above rather than a second slab.",How to Make Polymer Clay Molds," Most will require at least some kneading and warming.

The firmest brands and lines of polymer clay will make molds with the highest detail (Kato Polyclay, Fimo Classic, Premo, etc) but any brand or line can be used with good results. (Image doesn't show Kato Polyclay, Cernit, Souffle or Craftsmart, or other doll and flesh-colored clays.)





;
, Then form the ball into another shape if needed (perhaps a teardrop or log)., No release will be necessary for mold materials that won't easily stick to polymer clay. When a release is needed, several materials can work although water and cornstarch are the most frequently used:


Cornstarch (or baby powders made from 100% cornstarch) - Apply cornstarch onto the clay and/or into the mold with the tips of a soft fluffy brush or perhaps a homemade pounce bag. Brush or blow until no pockets of cornstarch remain in crevices. Cornstarch will rinse off the casts later if necessary.

Water - Mist or wipe the mold lightly with water. (It's best not to use water when using certain brands of raw clay such as Fimo and Cernit since one of their fillers may absorb water causing stickiness.)

Other powders - Apply metallic-colored powders, colored chalk powders, etc, to the clay with a soft brush.

Metallic leaf - Apply to the clay, making sure to adhere the leaf well. (Note that metallic leaf and the colored powders will change the color of the clay's surface.)

Oils - Mineral oil, etc, can also work though may make the clay slippery. ArmorAll spray is effective too but the silicone in it may prevent paints and clear finishes used after baking from adhering to the clay.







, Or instead press the clay onto or partly-around the item, whichever works best to create the mold., (Sometimes removing the item from the clay is not necessary if it's able take the baking temperatures of polymer clay and also won't swell, stick, etc in the mold while baking, but usually clay molds are baked alone.), Use a carrier that's rigid so it will be easy to move in and out of the oven without disturbing the clay and one that won't warp in the heat.

Position the raw clay mold on the carrier on any of its flat sides. If the mold is not flat or thick, place it instead on a wad of tissues or stuffing or in a pile of baking soda or cornstarch-- all are heat safe at polymer clay temperatures.
If the raw clay mold is thin in any area, first lightly stuff its interior with tissues, polyester stuffing, etc (or just re-make the mold so it's thicker). Polymer clay softens slightly with heat and may droop where thin so stuffing will add support.
If desired, avoid the shiny spots that show up on polymer clay after it's been heated in direct contact with very smooth surfaces like metal baking sheets, aluminum foil, glass or ceramic dishes, etc. To do that (or any time polymer clay is baked), place another material on the carrier before adding the clay. A flat material like a sheet of ordinary blank paper, patty paper (for separating hamburger patties), parchment paper or deli paper work well; or a non-flat material may sometimes be wanted like a sheet or wad of tissues, bit of polyester stuffing, pile of baking soda or pile of cornstarch, etc. Bare *unglazed* tiles work well too and are their own rigid carriers. None of those materials will change the natural texture of cured polymer clay which is similar to ordinary paper. (When making molds, shiny spots may not be a problem though.)

, Use an oven thermometer if possible, and bake at 265-325º F (130-160º C) depending on the brand or line of polymer clay. Some polymer clays will darken at those higher temperatures but darkening isn't important when making molds.

, Allow enough time for the clay to polymerize throughout, but polymer clay just becomes stronger the longer it's heated. Bake the clay in the *center* of an oven or a toaster oven., Or leave it in the oven until cool.,, They will be molds ""for polymer clay"" or molds made for other purposes (candy molds, etc). The molds may be faces, body parts, geometrics, flowers, trims, etc; most are small molds but some may be large.

, This can be very helpful for faces in particular.

, Form into a teardrop or log or any shape that will best fit into the mold. If needed, use a release on the clay or in the mold or both. Firmly press the clay ball into the mold, especially in the center to make sure all crevices will be filled (if there's a particularly deep and narrow depression inside the mold, put the tip of a clay teardrop in that spot first). To create a flat-backed mold, press on the back of the clay in the mold with an acrylic block or anything hard and flat., It may come out easily and without distortion or it may not depending on the shape of the mold, the stickiness and warmth of the clay used, etc. If there is excess clay on the back side, grab it like a handle and pull. If not, pull gently with your fingers from one edge or all around the outer edges till the cast is free. Another method is to use a wad of soft raw clay, press it onto the back of the cast, then roll it over the cast with an upward pull. Allowing the clay to cool in the mold will stiffen it and make removal easier as well (leave out overnight, or put into a freezer or refrigerator a few minutes)., Or do both. Polymer clay items created in molds (or texture sheets) are often ""antiqued"" or ""highlighted"" since both techniques will give molded clay pieces much more visual dimensionality and bring out their textural detail.

Antiquing involves coloring only the lower areas of a dimensional surface; highlighting involves coloring only the upper areas. Antiquing is often done with brown (or any color) acrylic paint, and after baking. Highlighting is often done with metallic powders (mica or real-metal powders), and usually before baking. To apply powders, touch a middle or index finger into the powder then tamp into the cap or onto another surface; rub the powder lightly in circles on the topmost parts of the clay. Permanent paints won't require sealing. Mica powders won't require sealing if they're rubbed in well, but some real-metal powders can oxidize and require sealing.











Metallic leaf can also be used for antiquing using a special technique, or for completely covering the item with leaf. (If a clay surface is not oily enough to grab the leaf in all spots, it can probably be coated very lightly with polyurethane or even thinned white glue which is allowed to tack up before the leaf is applied or raw or baked clay). Most leaf will need to be sealed against later oxidation so polyurethane or other sealers can be added before baking and then again after baking, or after baking then baking again and recoating.
Many colorants and materials can be used on polymer clay surfaces in addition to powders, paint and leaf. For more information on highlighting and antiquing, etc, see a concise summary here: http://glassattic.com/polymer/stamping.htm, under Basic Techniques (scroll down to Raw Clay). And for more on leaf, see http://glassattic.com/polymer/leaf.htm










.

, More and more ideas will come to mind once you begin using them. Casts may be already baked or still raw when they're used depending on the situation (raw ones will require baking at some point). Just a few examples of uses would be:


onlays and embellishment - placing onto (raw or baked) clay surfaces and items, or onto non-clay ones like wood/metal/cardboard boxes, Altoid tins, glass votives/jars, phone cases (decoden), Christmas ball ornaments, lids, cabinet knobs, light switch covers, bow centers, or almost anywhere







beads, jewelry, buttons - making cabochons or beads of any kind, pendants, earrings and other jewelry; using as onlays on clay jewelry parts; making buttons (wire shanks if wanted, can be pressed into the backs of buttons while still in molds)

clay faces or body parts - using for dolls and other human or animal figures including amulet figures, Halloween or Christmas figures, diorama figures, etc; or face casts can be used alone on more clay or other surfaces then be embellished with different kinds of hair, headgear, scarves, collars, bodices, etc. (for more details, see http: Faces Used Alone)

duplicates - making identical casts any time many copies of the same thing are needed (saves time and creates accuracy)

replacements - making molds, and then casts from them to use as replacement parts (polymer clay will be quite strong if it's not thin and doesn't have projecting parts)

, Various kinds of flexible or stiff blades and shape cutters can be used (e.g., the cast could be cut into a square, disk, curved and/or irregular rectangle, etc). Or if the clay used in a mold extends beyond the mold's edges, the extending clay can create an interesting frame effect around the cast.

, The thickness of the sheet will depend on the thickness of the texturing item being used and personal preference., This will help with separation of clay and texture sheet as well., Or rock it into the clay if it's not flat. If the texturing material is flat, roll over it with a roller or jar to create a deeper or more consistent impression in the clay; thin texture materials and clay can even be put through the rollers of a pasta machine together.

Just a few examples of texturing materials found around the house would be plastic canvas, areas of textured plastic from packaging or from anything, wire mesh, rough sandpaper, tree bark, the skin of cantaloupe or other veggies/fruits, salt, fabrics, lace, string, backs of leaves, stiff bristles, brick or stucco, textured wallpaper, etc. Texturing materials can also be created by making impressions all over a sheet of clay with ""stamps"" of any kind, including wads of aluminum foil, ends of ball point pens, bits of bark, stiff bristles, etc, or they can be made from hardened clays, paints, and more. Pointed tools, combs, tracing wheels, etc, can also be dragged or rolled across clay sheets to create texturing materials.
(Note that most texturing materials can also be used to texture polymer clay directly without being used as molds or stamps.)






Texturing materials can also be purchased in as thin flexible sheets of plastic, or various textured plastics can be found around the house or purchased (e.g, from the scrap bin of Tap Plastics, as cutting boards, etc).







, (Having put a sheet of paper, deli wrap or plastic wrap under the clay when pressing earlier can help with separation now by allowing the clay and paper to bend so they can more easily be peeled apart without distortion.), Or bake the textured sheet now, and use it later as a texture mold/sheet for new raw clay.

To use the new textured clay sheet while it's still raw, cut parts of it into one or more rectangular, circular, etc, flat shapes with a blade or a shape cutter, or shape cut parts any way you want (e.g., roll into a cylinder to make a bead, etc). Embellish the cut piece with more clay or non-clay items, or use it with other textured pieces of clay, or use larger pieces to cover whole lids or box sides, etc. Then bake.
To make the raw textured sheet into a hardened texture mold/sheet, bake, then use it later to texture new raw clay (that will create a reversed pattern). (If you want a very flat texture sheet/mold, be sure to use a flat rigid baking surface in the oven.)
Textured clay can be used as backgrounds for other clay or as focal elements, can be attached to the lids of boxes or wrapped around bottles, and more. Molds and texture sheets can also be used directly on raw clay to cover fingerprints in the clay, create animal skins, texture background areas or beads and other jewelry items, etc.

,,, Many of these can be considered to be ""stamps"" rather than ""molds;"" the distinction can become fuzzy., Make each one at least twice as thick as one-half of the thickness of the item used to make the mold.,,,

Add ""registration"" marks, if you want, which will help the two hardened sides fit together exactly when used later. That can be done, for example, by pressing a hole/etc. into the dusted side near each corner with the end of a paintbrush, or by pressing something hard and bakeable into the clay near the corners and leaving in place permanently.

, (That will be the first half of the final mold.)

If the item used is not bakeable, remove it before each baking for this method. It should fit when placed back in the baked mold before using the second slab, but to be sure wiggle it around in this first slab before removing to make a slightly larger impression.

,

If using a non-bakeable item, carefully remove the item and the bake second half separately.

,, (Try a vertical egg shape or a teardrop.)

Dust the surfaces and press the clay into one half of mold, then press the other half of mold on top being careful to align the registration marks.
Open, remove the newly molded clay item, then bake it separately. (If excess clay called flashing has squeezed out between the mold halves, trim it off with a blade or just smooth it down if possible.)







,, The resulting two-part mold can be any shape you choose to create around the item, and can save clay because it will conform more closely to the shape of the item being molded."

Add design elements.,
Use a cola can to form your clay into bracelets.,
Place the bracelets on a parchment lined cookie sheet.,
Bake the bracelets.,
Remove the bracelets from the oven and let cool.",How to Make Polymer Clay Bracelets," Making polymer clay bracelets is an easy project, but it does require some special materials. Before you get started, you will need:


Polymer clay in the color(s) of your choice.
A knife to cut the clay, such as a butter knife.
A non-stick cutting board to work on.
An empty can of soda.
A cookie sheet.
Parchment paper.;
, Baking your polymer clay bracelets will set them and make the shapes permanent. To make sure that your oven will be hot and ready to go when you are finished molding your bracelets, take a moment to set your oven to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.If your polymer clay suggests a different baking temperature, then preheat your oven to this temperature.
If you prefer not to bake your bracelets, you can also look for air drying polymer clay., Before you begin forming your clay into bracelets, you will need to get it nice and soft. Knead the clay in your hands for a few minutes or until it feels pliable. To knead the clay, squeeze it in your hands and roll it around the cutting board.

, You can make a polymer clay bracelets that are round, like bangles, or you can make flat cuff bracelets. Decide on the types of shapes you want to create and then begin to form them with the clay.


To make a flat strip for a cuff bracelet, roll the clay into a ball and then begin to form a long tube. Then, flatten the tube. You can use a rolling pin to do this or just flatten it with your hands. You can also use a knife to cut along the edges and make your strip into a long rectangle.
If you want to create a tube shaped bracelet for a bangle, then roll the clay into a ball and then shape it into a long tube. You can also make multiple small tubes and braid them to create a braided bangle., You can make bracelets that are simple strips or tubes of one color clay, or you can add other design elements to the strips or tubes you have created. You can embellish the strip by imprinting a design onto it, or by pressing different pieces of clay onto the strip.


To imprint the clay with a design, you can use a knife or toothpick to carve designs into the surface of the strip. For example, you could carve heart shapes into the bracelet. Or, you could carve words or initials into the strip. You could also use objects to imprint designs in the clay, such as by pressing a shell or coffee bean against the clay to imprint a shape.To add clay shapes to a bracelet, cut out the shapes you want from your other clay, and then gently press the shapes onto the strip. For example, you could use a cookie cutter or butter knife to cut out small triangles and press these onto the strip. Or, you could sue a small cookie cutter to cut out shapes and press those onto the strip. It is okay if they shapes cover the strip or go over the edges.

, When you are satisfied with the design of your clay strips and tubes, fold each of them around the bottom of a cola can to shape them into bracelets. If you are making bangles, then the strips will need to go all the way around the cola can.If you are making cuff bracelets, then you will need to leave about a one to two inch gap between the two ends of the strips.For a cuff bracelet, the gap will need to be wide enough to slip the bracelet over your wrist from the side, so you may want to measure this. Look at your wrist from the side and measure the height.
Cut off any excess clay using a knife.
Press the ends together if you are making bangle bracelets.
Slide the clay off of the soda can to maintain the shape. If the clay does not come off easily, then try wrapping a piece of parchment around the soda can before you wrap the clay around it.

, Line a cookie sheet with a piece of parchment paper that is big enough to cover the surface area you need for your bracelets. Parchment paper will prevent the clay from sticking to your cookie sheet.


If you are using an air drying polymer clay, then follow the instructions on the package for how long you need to let them dry. Plan for at least 24 hours and place them somewhere that they will not be disturbed.

, Place the bracelets in the center rack of your oven. The bracelets will need to bake for at least 25 minutes to make the shape permanent.Make sure that you set a timer before you put them into the oven.


Before you put the bracelet into the oven, ensure that it is preheated to 250 degrees Fahrenheit.
If any of your bracelets are thick tubes, then you may need to bake them for around 30 to 35 minutes.
Check the bracelets now and then while they are baking. If you notice the edges of a bracelet start to turn brown, then take them out of the oven.

, When the time is up, remove the bracelets from the oven. Place the cookie sheet on a potholder or trivet to let it cool. Do not touch the bracelets until they are completely cool! They will still feel soft after you remove them from the oven.When your bracelets are completely cool, then they are ready to wear!
If any of the edges of your bracelets turned brown from over-baking, then you can either paint over these spots or use an nail file to file them away."

Select quality ribbon.,
Use suitable thread.,
Use the correct needle.,
Work with short ribbon lengths.,
Start each ribbon length by leaving a small tail of about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) / 3/8"" long at the back of your work.,
Don't hold the thread or ribbon too tightly.,
Prevent the ribbon from twisting as you work.",How to Work With Ribbon for Embroidery," Always buy ribbon that is made well, carries a good colour and is recommended by the pattern. Pure silk ribbon is often a suggested preferred ribbon but there are other good quality ribbon types available, including rayon, satin etc. Cheaper ribbon from bargain stores may not be worth the savings in the long run; their fabric content can be questionable and the color might bleed if it becomes moist.;
, Embroidery thread is usually suitable for ribbon work but you should also be guided by the pattern's suggested thread.

, A chenille or tapestry needle is the right needle for ribbon embroidery. The large eye in each of these needles will make a bigger hole in the fabric, making it easier for the ribbon to pass through and less wearing on the ribbon.

, Ribbon tends to fray easily, hence it is better to work with it in shorter lengths so that it does not have to pass through the fabric too often. A good length to adopt is 30 centimeter (11.8 in) / 12"" long. This will provide adequate length to work with, without tempting fraying.

, Again, finish off with the same amount at the back each time. Stitch these tail ends at the end by sewing a thin embroidery thread through them from one end to the other or by letting embroidery stitches on the rest of the work sew through them. This will keep them in place without leaving bumps under your work.

, Work with a loose tension when embroidering using ribbon. This will help to keep the shape of your stitches and won't pull the ribbon out of shape, threatening fraying.

, Do this by making each stitch on the fabric and holding that in place with your thumb, and pulling the ribbon through at the same time.

Add least 1 inch (2.54 cm) to each of your object's measurements before marking cut lines on your box. You'll need the extra space for the mass of the mold.
Out of foam core board, cut 2 walls for the width and 2 walls for the length, keeping in mind the object's height. Cut 1 square (width measurement by length measurement) for the floor piece.

For a 1-part mold, secure the flat face of the object to the floor section of the mold box using an easy-release adhesive compound. This prevents any of your moldmaking compounds from leaking.

You may want to stay away from Insta-Mold and stick to modeling clay.


For a 2-part mold, layer the bottom of the mold box with clay and push the object into the clay, leaving 1/2 of its height exposed for molding. Once you feel you have submerged the lower portion of your object to its approximate half-mark, smooth the top surface of the clay as much as possible before moving on to the next step to make a mold.

, There are a number of varieties out there, so it's advised to do your research before you purchase anything.

Carefully remove the clay, leaving the rubber mold half intact.
Use a hobby knife to cut 3 or 4 pyramid shapes into the face of the mold. These will serve as matching-up joints for the 2 finished mold halves.
Create a new box to make a mold in, this time to the existing mold's length and width, allowing enough space in the height to pour the second part of the mold on top.
Set the object, mold side down, in the box. Make sure it fits snugly enough to not allow any new rubber compound to drip down the sides.
Paint the face of the mold you will be pouring on with mold release compound or thin film of vaseline. This will prevent the 2 mold halves from sticking together.
Pour your mold, let it set, then remove the box and pull the 2 sections apart. Your 2-part mold is complete.

",How to Make Pottery Sinks,";
,, Remember that sinks should be much thicker then most of the pots you have ever made. You probably will need about 6-9 kg (13.2-19.8 lb) of clay for a 30 cm (12 in) external diameter sink or 12-15kg (26.4-33 lb) for 42 cm (16 7/8 in) diameter sink. The quantity of clay depends on the sink type. Vessel sinks need to be thicker than drop-down sinks.

, If not, mix it with recycled softer clay or soak it in water for 24 hours before kneading.

, If needed, divide your clay to smaller lumps and knead them separately. You will combine them later directly on the wheel head.

Start a row of stitches.,
Finish a row of stitches.,
Create a fringe edge.,
Create a clean edge.,
Connect pieces of plastic canvas.",How to Stitch Plastic Canvas2," When you create a plastic canvas, you don’t want any loose threads hanging from your masterpiece. To accomplish this, and secure your row of stitches in the process, you need to stitch over the tail.


Thread your needle with approximately three feet of yarn or floss.
Insert the needle through the backside of the canvas until you are left with a two inch tail of yarn or floss.
Hold the tail against the back of your canvas so that it runs along your stitch line.
Execute your stitches over the tail until it is completely covered., When you complete a row or rows of stitches, you do not want to mar your creation with a bulky knot or a hanging tail. To create a clean, finish on the back of the canvas:


Flip the canvas so that its back faces up.
Insert your needle and yarn through several completed stitches.
Pull the yarn or floss tight.
Trim the yarn or floss as close to the canvas as possible., There are two basic stitches you may use to finish the edges of your plastic canvas: the lark’s head knot and the overcast stitch. The lark’s head knot is used to create a fringe edge. On patterns this stitch appears as “larks head.”


Insert the needle through the top of the canvas at an edge hole.
Pull the thread or yarn to the left side. Pull the needle up through the back of the canvas at the same hole.
Create a loop in the thread or yarn. The loop will hang from the backside of the canvas.
Insert the tails through the loop and pull tight.
Repeat., If you prefer a clean edge, use an overcast stitch instead of a lark’s head knot. On patterns, this stitch appears as “overcast.”


Pull the needle up through the back of the canvas at an edge hole.
Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edge of the canvas.
Pull the needle up through the back of the canvas at the neighboring edge hole.
Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edge of the canvas.
Repeat.
Produce one stitch per hole along the edge and inner corner of the canvas. Create 2 to 3 stitches per hole located on the outside corners., If you need to create a larger canvas, you can stitch together two or more pieces with a whipstitch. In patterns, this stitch appears as “whipstitch.”


Stack your canvas on top of each other so that the edges are flush.
Pull the needle up through the two canvases at the top edge hole.
Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edges of the canvas.
Insert the needle into the next hole and pull it through.
Wrap the thread or floss tightly against the edge of the canvas.
Repeat until you reach the bottom of the canvas."

Select your plastic canvas.,
Pick out a needle.,
Select yarn or floss.",How to Stitch Plastic Canvas3," Plastic canvas is a grid structure formed by a series of holes and bars (gridlines). It comes in a variety of colors (clear or colored), shapes (rectangular or pre-cut shapes), and thicknesses (soft, regular, or stiff). It also comes in 4 different hole counts.


5-count plastic canvas has 25 squares per square inch. This canvas is only available in a clear, rectangular sheet of regular thickness.
7-count plastic canvas has 49 squares per square inch. It is the most common plastic canvas. It is the only count available in a variety of colors, shapes, and all three thicknesses.
10-count plastic canvas has 100 squares per square inch. This count is available in a small selection of colors. It is only available in rectangular sheet of regular thickness.
14-count plastic canvas has 144 squares per square inch. This count is available in clear, black, and white. It is only sold in rectangular sheets of regular thickness., The tapestry needle is most commonly used for plastic canvas work. Tapestry needles are characterized by their large eye and blunt, round tip. The large eye allows your to thread multiple strands of yarn or floss. You will need a different size needle for each plastic canvas count.


7-count requires a size 16 tapestry needle.
10-count requires a size 18 tapestry needle.
14 count requires a size 20 tapestry needle., In addition to using a different size needle for each count, you will also need to use a different size yarn or thread. While the 5-count requires multiples strands, the others require only one strand.


5-count plastic canvas requires 2 strands of 4-ply worsted wool.
7-count requires 1 strand of 4-ply worsted wool.
10-count requires a 3-ply sport wool, #3 Perle Cotton, or a 12-plies floss.
14-count requires 6-plies floss or a #5 Perle Cotton."

For each poppy that you want to make, punch out ten circles with a circular cookie cutter. Once you’re done, press your finger along the edges of each one to soften and thin them.Pressing the edges down may cause the circles to stick to your worktable. Use any thin tool that you have handy to scrape them off as needed.;
, For each circle, choose one edge to be your top and its opposite to be your bottom. Run the ball end of a medium-size stylus from the center of the bottom toward the top to create a slightly depressed line running straight up the middle. Repeat several times on both sides of the first line, with each line fanning outward from the bottom of the center line toward the circle’s edges.You don’t need to start each line in the exact center of the circle’s bottom edge, but the bottoms of your lines should be grouped close together toward the center and then spread outward from there.

, Ball up the clay left over from punching out your petals and roll it out again, as thin as before. Your base should be thicker than your petals, however, so either fold the sheet in half to create a double layer, or trim two squares from it and press them together. Punch out a circle for your base with a cookie cutter.Of course, if your original sheet of rolled clay has enough left for two squares, don’t worry about balling it up and rolling it out again.

, First, press the ball of a fatter stylus into the center of your base to create a bowl effect. Apply gentle pressure to avoid flattening the whole thing. Use your fingers to smooth and fix the edges afterward if they appear uneven.Repeat if desired for an even deeper bowl. Just be sure not to break through the bottom of the bowl. You want to keep that intact.

, Lay a headpin flat across one rim of your bowl. Line up the head of the pin with the center of the bowl. Once the pin’s head is centered, gently press the body of the pin through the rim. Work slowly so the pin remains perfectly horizontal as it goes down. Stop once the pin’s head comes to a rest at the bottom of your bowl, about halfway down the base, depending on how deep you made your bowl.As before, be careful not to push the pin all the way through your base. You want to keep the bottom of your bowl intact for the next step.

, Take a strip of clay from your flattened sheet. Lay it over the rim of your bowl where the body of the pin cut through it. Use your stylus to lightly press the strip into the clay and reshape the rim as needed.Then, once the body of the pin has been secured in the rim, dab some clear liquid clay into the bowl to keep the head in place.

, Set five of them aside for later. With the remaining five, place the bottom of one petal along the inner rim of your base’s bowl. Use your stylus to smooth the petal’s bottom into the rim itself until the two clays join. Then add a second petal in the same fashion. With this one, however, line the bottom up so half of it is covering where you just attached the first petal.Repeat with each petal, using each one to cover about half of the previous petal.
By the time you’re done layering all the petals over each other, the bowl and hairpin should be covered and hidden from view.

, Notice how your petals are still relatively flat. Give them some more life by reshaping them. Gently place the ball of one stylus on the upper side of a petal. Now do the same underneath the petal, a little farther along its edge. Gently manipulate your styluses to slightly twist the petal’s edge as you please.Use the same technique with each petal. At the same time, try not to shape each one exactly the same. You want to suggest natural growth and movement, so try to avoid a uniform look.
Go over all five petals as many times as it takes until you’re satisfied with your sculpted flower.

, A flower’s “peduncle” is the base from which the petals grow. Use your fingers to shape a ball of green clay that’s small enough to fit in the very center of your flower where the bottoms of your petals overlap. Then flatten the peduncle’s bottom on your worktable so it’s dome-shaped. Press your thinnest stylus into the center of the dome’s top. Now use your stylus to draw lines from the center, down its sides, to the bottom, all the way around the dome, so it resembles a buncake.Once you’ve drawn your lines, roughen the texture by lightly brushing a toothbrush over the surface.
If your toothbrush smooths out one of your lines by accident, just go over it again with your stylus to correct it.

, Dab some liquid clay in the center of your flower. Set the peduncle in place. Apply just the slightest pressure to help it set into the liquid.Once it’s in place, use the same stylus as before to reshape any lines that might have smoothed out while being handled.
If necessary, go over it again with your toothbrush as well.

, First, trace a thin line around the edges of the peduncle. Secure it that much more to your flower. Then add lines of liquid clay from the peduncles’ edges straight up along the petals.Remember: you’re trying to replicate nature, so try not to be too orderly about drawing lines.
Avoid patterns (like one short, one long, one short, one long, etc.) or drawing two side-by-side lines that look exactly the same.
When it’s finished, there shouldn’t be any open space between the lines radiating out from the peduncle.

, Harden what you have so you can move on to the flower’s back without wrecking its front. Heat your oven to 130 degrees Celsius (266 Fahrenheit). Once it’s ready, set your flower on a baking sheet and bake for ten minutes. However, always check the directions of your particular brand of clay first. If the manufacturer advises a lower temperature, follow their instructions.Polymer clay is safe to bake in a home oven, as long as you don’t burn it. If it burns, it may start to release toxic fumes.To be extra safe, use an oven thermometer to confirm that your oven doesn’t heat higher than the temperature you set it to.
A baking sheet is probably very easy to clean, but to be extra safe, devote one exclusively for clay. Don’t reuse it for cooking.

, After your clay is done baking, let your flower cool off before handling it again. Once it’s cool enough to touch, brush liquid clay along the back of the base. Use fresh red clay to form a thin disk that’s a little smaller than the flower’s base. Press this into the liquid clay.Once your disk is attached to the back of the base, add your remaining five petals to the fresh clay. Use the same technique as before. Smooth the bottom of each petal into the clay. Use each petal to cover half of the previous one. Then use your styluses to twist your petals’ edges for a more natural, random effect.

, A flower's sepal is a leaf-like growth that cups the back of the flower. Roll out a thin sheet of green clay. Use your stylus to trace outline for a sepal to add to the back of your flower (these resemble a bikini shape), and then cut it out with a sculpting knife. Run your stylus down the center of each one of its three offshoots. Then use your thinnest stylus to draw veins from the center line out to the edges of each side.Once you’re done, place one sepal over the back’s center, using your fingers or stylus to gently press it into the new petals so their clays join.
Go over your sepal’s lines with your thin stylus again to sharpen them if they smoothed out while you pressed.

, Return the clay to the oven to bake for another 15 to 20 minutes. Remove it and let it cool off again. To add even more detail in and around the peduncle, apply brown or black acrylic paint with a fine brush along its lines, as well as the surrounding lines of dried liquid clay.Once the paint dries, brush the whole thing with sculptor’s glaze for a shiny finish, if you like.

Trouble-shoot your handspinning.",How to Spin Wool," You will have to decide if you prefer a drop spindle or a spinning wheel. Both have benefits and drawbacks. Drop spindles are good to use when starting out, but spinning wheels tend to be a faster way to spin.Using a drop spindle. Creating your own drop spindle is simple and easy. When you've mastered the spindle, you'll have mastered all the different steps for spinning (drawing out the fibers, twisting the fibers into yarn, and winding up and storing spun yarn).
The best drop spindle to begin with is the top whorl drop spindle with a hook at the top. This one is sturdy enough to be dropped on the floor as you're getting accustomed to spinning.
The spinning wheel is more difficult to master than the drop spindle, because it requires pedals to work the speed of the wheel and has more parts than a drop spindle. However, once you've gotten the hang of spinning on a wheel, you can spin more quickly than with a drop spindle.
A spinning wheel works by rotating the bobbin using the drive band. While you treadle, the wheel turns and the flyer and the bobbin rotate. You twist the fibers in your hand and these are wound around the bobbin. You have to change the speed of bobbin in order to get the yarn on the bobbin automatically. Different types of spinning wheels can facilitate the wrapping of the yarn around the bobbin in different ways.;
, There are lots of words that you're not going to be immediately familiar with when you're just starting out. You'll need to learn the words for the different aspects of the spinning process before you can start spinning.Roving is a continuous rope of fibers that have already been carded and are ready to spin.
Carding is when you prepare cleaned but unprocessed wool by hand carding or with a drum carder. A drum carder is a mechanical device, either hand cranked or electric, that cards fibers for spinning. The device you use to hand card is typically a large paddle set with 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) curved metal tines.
A niddy-noddy is a double-headed tool used in skeining spun yarn. Skeining basically means to wind the thread off the spindle.
A skein is a length of yarn or thread that has been loosely coiled and knotted. When you're spinning you're looking to create skeins of thread.

, Spinning wheels have the same basic equipment whatever type they are. Some have more components than others, but usually the basic components are the same. You'll need to keep the different parts of the spinning wheel in mind when you're learning to spin.The flywheel is the piece that rotates when you treadle, which causes the rest of the pieces to move. Not all wheels look the same (or look like the typical ""fairytale"" wheel), but all spinning wheels have some type of wheel.
The drive band wraps around the flywheel and the flyer whorl (which is the pulley attached to the flyer and driven by the drive band. There are different sized grooves on the flyer whorl that determine how fast the wheel will spin) and the flyer (a U-shaped piece of wood that has hooks lining up one or both arms; these hooks store the yarn on the bobbin). The drive band rotates the flyer which puts the twist into the fiber.
The tension knob adjusts the tension of the drive band by lowering and raising the mother-of-all (which is the bar that mounts the flyer, bobbin, and tension knob).
The bobbin is what operates on the spindle along with the flyer, storing the yarn. It can operate with or separately from the drive band. The orifice is the opening at the end of the spindle where the yarn goes through and connects to the flyer's hooks.
The treadle is the pedal that operates the wheel and is used by your feet. This determines the speed of the spinning wheel.

, If you've decided that you want to use a spinning wheel rather than a drop spindle, then you'll need to learn about the different kinds of spinning wheels. If you're just starting out it might be best to rent or borrow a spinning wheel, so that you get the hang of it and decide it's really what you want to do. There are several different basic types of spinning wheels.The Saxony is the typical fairy tale type of wheel with wheel on one end, flyer on the other, sloping frame, and typically three legs. This spinning wheel tends to be more expensive.
Castle wheels have the flyer positioned above the wheel. They normally have three to four legs, but tend to be more compact than the other types of wheels. They are good for someone who has less working space. In terms of more traditional wheels, this one is the cheapest.
Norwegian wheels are similar to the Saxony. They typically have three to four legs, a large wheel, and are usually quite ornate. They are also typically within the same price range as the Saxony
Modern wheels can often have an odd appearance as they are typically hybrids of other types of spinning wheels. They often have better engineering than the other kinds and some can even fold up! As for price, it depends on the wheel, but they typically run less than the previous wheels.
Electric spinners are nice because you don't have to worry about the treadle or the wheel (they don't have them). They can be placed on a table and used manually and are easy to carry and store. These also tend to run more cheaply than the typical, full length spinning wheel.
Spindle wheels don't have a flyer and bobbin. Instead, a pointed spike both twists and accumulates the spun yarn. These are also less expensive than the typical spinning wheels.

, There are certain things you'll need to consider when you're choosing a spinning wheel. These will determine the kinds of thread you spin, what speed you spin at, and how easy the treadles are to use.


The speed of your wheel (what ""gear"" the treadle is in, essentially) determines how quickly the twist develops in your yarn. Fine fibers like Merino wool and angora or short fibers like cotton require faster speeds. More coarse fibers like Romney or Border Leicester need a slower speed. It's best to find a spinning wheel that has a range of speeds so that it can be more versatile.
On single drive wheels the drive band goes around the wheel one time. Then it goes around the drive pulley on the flyer or the bobbin. Double drive wheels also use one drive band but it goes around the wheel twice. The single drive is easier for beginners to use, because it has a separate break system. When you have to change the speed of the bobbin it's easier to do on the single drive wheel (because it breaks). On the double drive wheel, you actually have to speed up.
Bobbin capacity depends on the manufacturer. There are no one-size-fits-all bobbins. The best way to compare bobbin capacity is to calculate the volume of the bobbin available to wind on the yarn. Many manufacturers have a selection of different bobbin sizes.

, Try to get a fleece that has been just sheared, because the grease makes the wool softer. You will also need to keep a few things in mind when choosing your fleece. These include what you're making out of the spun yarn, color, and faults in the fleece that will make your spinning experience difficult!


Think about what you're planning to do with the finished yarn. Are you making socks? Weaving? Knitting? Making outerwear? Different kinds of fleece have different softness levels, which you'll need to look into when you're choosing the fleece to spin with.
Watch for certain faults in the fleece that will inhibit your spinning. Avoid buying fleece with a break in it. If you give a lock of fleece a sharp tug and it breaks (typically in the middle), this will cause pilling in the roving and make for weak yarn. Fleece that has vegetable matter in it makes for difficult carding and cleaning (if you like combing the fleece and have the time, you can get this, but otherwise it's best not to).
Check that the crimp of your fleece is even. Spread out the fleece and check at least three different areas (haunch, shoulder, mid-side, for example). You want to make sure that one area isn't coarser and hairier than another area.
Wheel-to-flyer ratio determines what type of yarn can be spun. A wheel that has a ratio for medium or bulky yarns will be used for spinning wool, so the size of your yarn will depend on your wheel.

, Often you have to scour (wash) the fleece before carding and spinning. This is to remove the oils from it, which can make it difficult to spin. Although you can wash in cold water, it's recommended that you use hot water. You want the water to be hot enough to be uncomfortable, but not so hot that you can't actually wash the wool.


Use a large bathtub or basin. You can divide into sections to make it easier to wash it well, and so that you don't crowd the fleece.
Some handspinners like to leave the grease in (called ""spinning in the grease"") and wait to clean the fiber when setting the twist into the yarn. However, leaving in the grease can make it difficult to dye and can ruin the carding cloth on a drum carder.

, You can use just about any laundry detergent as long as it doesn't have bleach or added conditioner. Conditioner can leave behind a filmy residue on the fleece.


Don't completely strip the oils out of the fleece. Removing too much of the natural oils can make it as difficult to spin (which is why some handspinners spin with the oils and wash later).
You also want to make sure that you aren't using so much detergent that you have to wash the fleece ten times to get all the suds out. Washing too much and too vigorously can turn the fleece into felt, which you want to avoid.

, You will want to soak the fleece in the water to get rid of dirt, oils, and other unclean undesirables. Leaving it to soak means that you won't accidentally turn it into felt.Do not allow running water to run directly on the fleece.

, You will need to stir the fleece around gently, with your hands or a wooden spoon handle. Remember, too much agitating will turn your fleece into felt.

, Each time you rinse the wool, make sure that the temperature is the same as the times before. The more open you allow the fleece to be in the water, the fewer wash/rinse cycles you'll have to go through. Depending on how dirty, or how fine the wool is you may have to do more wash/rinse cycles.


Soak the fleece in hot water with about one-half cup of white vinegar for 30 minutes, for the last rinse.
Mohair, merino, rambouillet, and other finer wools tend to need multiple washes.

, Gently squeeze the wet wool. Spread on a towel or drying rack, or hang over your porch railing. If you can put them outside to dry, do that. The best weather for drying wool is sunny and windy.

, Carding aligns all the fibers in the one direction. It fluffs them to make the drafting easier. You can send it to a factory, use a drum card, or a hand comb. Consider using a metal dog comb, which is the most inexpensive choice.If you're using carding paddles (which are a good, easy way to go), take a piece of the clean, dry fleece and drape pieces of it it one direction. With the other paddle, you'll gently swipe across the fibers, aligning them in the same direction. When the fleece is fluffy and aligned, put the piece aside.
No matter what type of carding you're doing, the same basic principle is the same. You are trying to align the fibers one way, whether you're doing it with a metal dog comb, with paddles, or with a drum card.
One of things people tend to do wrong is over-card their fleece. Your goal is to make the fleece look presentable, fluffy, and aligned. You don't need to beat the fibers into submission.
Make sure that the wool is completely dry. Fleece is amazing in its ability to retain water, and wet fleece isn't going to card properly.

, One of the best things about a drop spindle is that it is relatively easy to make and to use. If you decide to go this route, then you can make your own drop spindle without much cost. Gather the materials listed below.


A one-foot long wooden dowel. Although size isn't that important, a recommended diameter size is 3/8 of an inch. This will act as the main shaft for the spindle.
A hook, or wire that can be bent into a hook. You'll make sure to hook your yarn through here.
Two heavy CDs to act as the whorl.
Rubber grommets that match the diameter of your dowel. You can get these at any farm store or auto part store. So if the diameter of your dowel is 3/8 of an inch, the inside hole (bore diameter) should be 3/8 of an inch, the panel hole should be 5/8 of an inch to match the hole in the CDs, and the outside diameter should be about 7/8 of an inch.
Get a serrated knife, or small saw and scissors to cut the dowel.

, To do this you'll need to make a hole in the center of the dowel with a pushpin. Screw the cup hook into the hole so that it will stay in place.

, You want the grommet to fit snugly in the center of the CDs. This can be a little frustrating since it's a tight fit, but once you've pulled the edges of the grommet up, it should be good to go.

, As long as you've judged the sizes correctly you should be finished making your drop spindle. If it doesn't quite fit, wrap the dowel with electrical tape until the dowel and CDs slip on and fit tightly.

, For a beginning spinner, one piece of roving is going to be too big. Break that piece down into sections that are about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. Carefully split your roving down the middle to form two strips instead of one. This will make spinning easier if you're just beginning.

, Your leader is a piece of yarn about 18 inches (45.7 cm) long that's tied onto the spindle shaft right above the whorl (the CDs). Put the yarn over the whorl and loop it around the shaft underneath. Put it back over the whorl and secure the end to the hook., Letting the spindle hang beneath your hand, suspended by the leader, take the spindle in your right hand and the leader in your left hand. Spin the drop spindle from the dowel (or shaft) in a clockwise direction.


Repeat this process in the same direction until the leader begins to take in the twist. You'll leave a fluff of fiber at the end so you can join on more fiber.
It's a good idea to practice making the spindle rotate, so that you get a feel for the direction you'll be spinning the drop spindle to make the yarn.

, Keeping tension on your spun yarn, allow the twist to run into the newly drafted fiber. Keep repeating this process and check that there is enough twist before you move on. When the yarn is long enough that the spindle almost touches the ground, unhook it and wrap it around the base of the spindle next to the whorl.


This is called a single. You'll want to leave enough yarn unwound so that you can slip it back on the book with a couple of inches to spare.
If you find that the yarn is pulling apart or too slack, spin your spindle again to store more of the twist.

, Overlap the wool a few inches of the fluff of drafted fibers, so that you can catch and twist more onto the leader. Allow the twist to run into the joined fibers, adding more twist by spinning the spindle, because you want to make sure that your join is secure.


To test the join, give the spindle another twist and bring your right hand back to where the left hand holds the yarn. Move your left hand back about three inches, as you pull and draft out more fibers of wool and allow the spindle to turn a few times.
Release the yarn with your right hand and left the twist move up into the fibers as you did previously. Now, gently pull more fibers from the fiber mass by pulling back with your left hand, and allowing the twist to run into the drafted fibers.

, This is when you pull fibers from material to be spun and thin them down to form the size of the yarn you want to spin. If you draft more fibers, your yarn will be thicker; less fibers and it will be thinner.If your fiber is in a long, continuous narrow strip, this is the form of fiber processing called roving. If it's in a wide, rolled-up bundle that unrolls into a wide rectangle, that is the form of fiber processing called a batt.
Pick a strip about 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and approximately thickness of your thumb (this doesn't have to be exact).
Hold the strip of fiber in one hand (doesn't matter which). Pull a few fibers from one end of your strip with your other hand. Drafting things the fiber down the the desired thickness for your spun yarn.
The spinning process will twist the fibers, which also thin them down. As you get better at drafting and spinning, you'll find it easier to judge the size of your drafts.

, The leader is a piece of yarn that has previously been spun and can be attached to the shaft of your bobbin. Cut a piece of yarn about 36 inches (91.4 cm) and tie it to the shaft of your bobbin. Make sure that you tie it snugly.


Pull the leader through the orifice on your spinning wheel. Once you do this you're ready to begin the actual spinning!
If you're just starting to spin, it's a good idea to practice spinning just with the leader so you get a feel for how the spinning wheel works, how to start spinning the wheel just with the treadles.

, You will want to overlap them for about four to six inches. You'll hold the bundle of fiber in one hand (the fiber hand), and the leader and fiber in the other hand (this is the drafting hand).

, You want to make sure that the wheel is going in a clockwise motion. This will create the ""Z"" twist in your single strand of spun yarn. Allow the leader and the fiber to twist together, holding them for a moment while they twist, so that they are secure.


Make sure you let the wheel take up the fiber as you draft more fiber.

, Overlap un-spun and spun fiber, holding it with your non-dominant hand and turn the wheel clockwise. This will cause the fiber to twist, which is what turns the fiber into yarn.


Make sure that your drafting hand is between the fiber hand and orifice of your spinning wheel. You don't, however, have to keep your hands close to the orifice as you spin.
Always make sure to spin the wheel in a clockwise manner.

, You will want to slide your drafting hand towards the bundle of fiber to draft more fiber to be spun. It's best when you're just starting to stop spinning, draft the fiber, and then spin, then stop and draft again. As you grow more comfortable, it will turn into one continuous motion.


Take care that you don't allow the twist to travel to the fiber in your fiber hand.
Your non-dominant hand should be closest to the wheel and the dominant hand closer to you.

, You will do this once the spindle is full. Wrap around your hand and elbow, much like winding cord and tie at intervals with acrylic yarn.


This is when you might use the implement known as the ""niddy-noddy."" Wrap the yarn from the bobbin onto the niddy. This will create a large loop in a small amount of space, which you'll then tie in sections and remove by sliding it off one shoulder of the niddy.

, You'll do this by soaking the skein in hot water and hanging it to dry. You can use a plastic hanger, or hang it over a drying rack. Hang something heavy from the skein while drying.

, Sometimes your yarn gets tangled between the bobbin and the flyer. Basically this means that your treadling isn't even (which happens a lot with first time spinners!). Break off the yarn, hook it back up, and start over again.This can also happen because the bobbin is too full, which causes the yarn to spill over the edges of the bobbin and tangle around the shaft. Empty the bobbin as you would normally and start fresh.

, Sometimes when you're spinning you lose the end. Don't fret! Roll your bobbin around a few times. Often the end is under the last hook that it was over.


Try using a piece of tape to see if you can pull up the loose end. This solution works about half the time.
Otherwise, pick the most likely end and pull enough yarn for a new leader so you can start again.

, If your yarn is lumpy and bumpy it means that you aren't spinning it consistently. You might be pulling out too much fiber. If so, what you need to work on is getting into a consistent rhythm for spinning.

, Some of the same problems happen in handspinning that happen with a spinning wheel. Sometimes there is a different way of fixing it as opposed to a spinning wheel (for example, you don't have the flyer and the bobbin and so those types of tangles aren't typical).


Spindle gets away from you. If your spindle gets away from you and the twists runs up into the fiber mass, stop your spindle and untwist your fiber mass. Then, start the drafting again. This is a very common occurrence for beginners.
If you have thick and thin spots in your yarn (known as slubs), you can do something like keep them and have a novelty yarn (good for knitting scarves). Otherwise you can remove the slubs by pinching the yarn with your hands on either side of the slub and untwisting until the fibers draft out a little.
Over-twisted yarn is a common beginner's problem. You can tell your yarn is over-twisted if you have a thick strand that feels very hard and dense. The strand can kink back on itself when you relax your tension. To fix this, loosen some of the extra twist by drafting out more fibers.

However, even then it is safer to pin, sticky tack or gum the four corners of the two sheets together. This is especially useful in case of interruption such as the telephone ringing, as it is difficult to fit them together again exactly.
, The tracing may be done with a pencil, or, with a gel ink pen or water-colour paint., The process of tracing is easy enough, so long as the hand does not get tired. Depending on how complex and large the pattern, you will become tired, hence the reason why it is best to tack the pattern to the window to take rest periods., Use as required."

, Bring the needle through the back of the fabric a short distance below your first stitch. This new hole should be in line with the first two (not off to either side.)

, Bring the needle under the initial stitch from the side. You may need to use the needle tip to work the stitch open slightly. Pull the thread through so that it's reasonably tight (but not so tight that the fabric bunches up.)

, Next, put the needle point through the same hole that you came up through in Step 2. Your stitch should look like a skinny oval or slit. You've just made the first ""link"" of your chain!

Get a binder or box.,
Choose a organization method.Depending on the type of trading cards you're using, it's a good idea to figure out early on how you're going to sort your cards.,
Sort by your chosen category.Before you put the cards into a binder, it's a good idea to sort them out first.,
Label your sections.,

Keep track of your card values.Trading cards can have enormous monetary value.,
Set aside duplicates and tradables.An avid collector will inevitably run into plenty of duplicates.,
Organize your collection as early as possible.",How to Organize Your Trading Cards," Most card collectors use binders to keep their cards. A binder offers safety and an accessible showcase if you want to show your cards off to someone. You should prepare to buy a high-quality binder that's appropriate for displaying such high-value items. Boxes, on the other hand, offer more safety, but don't have the same readymade presentation. If you get a box, index card dividers will act as a trusty partition between categories.Each of these index partitions will help you categorize the cards within each box. Sticky tabs may be used to the same effect in binders.


If your cards are too valuable to be worth storing in basic binders, it may be worth it to buy high-protection plastic sleeves for each of the cards.This will reduce smudging and tear risks. Toploaders are recommended for the most hardcore, high-value collectors.Depending on the size of your collection, you may need multiple binders and boxes. If this is the case, you should try to turn each binder/box into a broad category.;
, Most card brands offer prescribed categories. You may choose to follow these categories if you want. Otherwise, you can order them numerically (if applicable) or alphabetically. A numerical or alphabetical ordering system can be used within each category as well.


Sports cards might be categorized by player type, team, year, set and the sport itself. Some collector choose to specialize in specific teams. Collecting all of the cards in a given team will increase your collection's value.
Pokemon cards might be categorized by the particular card type or its rareness. Other ""character"" cards may be sorted according to the unique categories of that given product.
For duplicate cards, you can place them side by side. For less valuable cards in binders, a common trick is to make the cards share the same sleeve. It is helpful to make a note somewhere that the duplicate exists, as it won't be readily visible from the start.

, Place each card in its assigned pile. Keep a healthy distance of space between certain piles. If you are dealing with enough cards, the piles may get big enough to the point where separate piles eventually merge.

, Once you have your card piles sorted out, it's time to list the categories listed in your box or binder. With a permanent marker, neatly list the category on a tab and place it at the beginning of a given category. It helps to have all of your categories planned out before you get to this stage. That way, you can allot enough space to each section in your storage.


Though it may seem obvious, you should make a point of marking the box or binder itself. If you're storing them in your attic, they can get lost amidst a number of other things.
There's a tendency for collectors to scribble the categories. While you obviously don't need to make the lettering perfect, it is a good idea to ensure the writing is legible for anyone who might see it. Furthermore, giving your lettering some creative flair might add to the aesthetic value of your collection.
It's a good idea to count out the number of cards in each category before marking your sections. That way, you can give each category ample space in your binder.

, Put on a show or listen to music while you arrange the cards by type. This will make your time feel more worthwhile. Make a point of placing the cards in carefully. If your cards have a monetary worth associated with them, the slightest crease or tear could ruin their value.

, If you're a passionate collector, you'll always be on the lookout for new additions. With this in mind, it's good to organize your binder with future finds in mind. Leave some extra space at the end of each category to accommodate for this.


If you're ordering within each category itself, you can save yourself organizing in the future by taking account of the cards you still need. If there's a limited amount needed to complete a collection, leave an open space where that card will eventually go. This also gives you a visual reference as to how complete your collection currently is.
If your collection expands beyond the capacity of your given storage, it may be time to reorganize the collection. Luckily, with your cards already in their proper categories, reorganizing will only take a fraction of the original time it took to get things together.

, With that in mind, finding a spot where they'll be safe and untouched is paramount. A temperate basement or attic is a good place to store basic hobby cards for the long-term. More valuable cards should be kept somewhere heat and moisture controlled, like an office. Renting out a moisture-regulated lockup to keep your cards in is recommended if they're sufficiently valuable. If you want quick access to your collection, a filing cabinet is a good idea. Binders are more frail than boxes, and should be placed in a storage box if you're storing them for a long time.


Make sure your basement or attic is free from excess issues like heat or moisture. If this is the case, you should store it somewhere more temperate, such as a bedroom closet.
If you have to store your cards in a damp or hot area, you should invest in rigid snap-cases. This will protect your cards from most of the environmental issues. They can run up a cost if you need enough of them, but they're worth it if your cards are sufficiently valuable.If your collection carries some significant monetary weight, it's not unreasonable to lock it up in a safe.

, While a digital representation of your card collection may be redundant for smaller collections, it becomes increasingly useful once your collection crosses over into needing multiple boxes or binders.


Make sure to include the essential card data, including the name, category, and estimated monetary value. Sports cards will indicate the maker of the card, the year, sport, player name, number, condition and whether or not the card itself is signed. Other card systems (such as ""character"" cards) should be catalogued according to each of that brands specific properties.
There are software programs specifically designed for card-collecting. If a spreadsheet is too impersonal for your needs, you should look up a card organizing program., This offers a shorthand method of referring to certain cards. Again, this is a card-keeping method that only really makes sense if your collection gets really big.

, A lot of things factor into a card's market worth, including condition, rarity, desirability and historical significance. If you aren't sure of the values themselves, you can show them to trading card specialist. For a fee, a specialist will appraise the condition and rarity of a card and give you a rough estimate of its worth on the market.

, Having more than one card isn't usually seen as a particularly desirable, but a card copy can come in handy if you're trading with other collectors. With this in mind, it's a good idea to set aside the cards you want to trade. At a convention, you may run into another collector that has a card you want. By trading your duplicates for cards you want, you'll be able to get a solid use out of them.

, The longer you let your collection grow unchecked, the more harrowing it will be to ultimately get it in order.If you're starting out with a trading card collection, it's never too early to start sorting them out by type. As time goes on, your categories will get more elaborate. However, even a basic set of 5-10 cards can be arranged in a way that makes logical sense.

Decide what kind of cards you want to collect and for what purpose.,
Have a target list of what you want to collect.,
Research what kind of cards are currently in print.,
Buy in bulk.",How to Collect Pokémon Cards1," Trading cards often have dual purposes and for Pokémon cards, you can either collect the cards for the fun of hunting them down or you can collect them so you can play the Pokémon Trading Card Game.If you only want to collect and display cards, you have the freedom to go in any direction with the kinds of cards you want. You can collect based off of Pokémon types, card values, sets, or any category you can think of. , Some people exclusively try to collect rare or special cards while others are looking for certain types of Pokémon or want to catch them all. Being more specific with your list can help narrow down your search among the 700+ Pokémon that currently exist. As you start out, keep in mind that there are different rarities for cards. 'Rarity' is a term used to determine how hard a card is to find and the rarity is marked on the bottom right of the card with a symbol:Easier to find cards include common (black circle mark), uncommon (black diamond), or rare (black star).
Harder to find cards are either holofoil rare (black star with holographic art), ultra rare (white star), or secret rare(rarity symbol with a serial number).
Some of the most sought-after cards are either full art (cards with only art), EX ('EX' is next to the Pokémon name), or reverse holos (holographic sheen is on everything but the art). These cards are limited edition and can be worth a lot of money in mint condition., It's easier to start collecting the most recent printing of cards because they are more widely and readily available. Pokémon cards are released in sets when they are printed by the manufacturers but the sets are spread out across the world in separate packs of cards, such as starter or booster packs. Many people aim for collecting a whole set; there are generally 102 different cards per set. Be aware, sets can also have expansion packs that extend the list of cards you will need to complete that particular set. It is easier to collect a set while it's in print. The older a set is or if it goes out of print, the more difficult it will be to find those cards and they will often become more expensive as well., Vendors online as well as places like flea markets and hobby stores will often have options to buy cards in bulk. You can purchase a large amount at a discounted price and usually save money on shipping as well. One downside to bulk purchases is that you may not find anything of high value. But sometimes there's a rare card hiding among a few hundred common ones. The hunt for valuable cards is part of the advantage and allure for buying in bulk."

Start by making a single ""link"" of a basic chain stitch.,
Make a second ""link"" through the original stitch.,
Make a third link through the first two links.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Sew Chain Stitch2," This variation on the basic chain stitch has a thicker, more defined appearance, making it a great choice for stitching borders and outlines that you want to stand out. To begin, you'll want to create a one-link basic chain stitch according to the method above.In other words:Start with a single small stitch
Come back through the fabric at a spot in line with your stitch (less than an inch or so away)
Loop your thread through your first stitch
Put the needle back through the hole it came from.

, At this point, the heavy chain stitch starts to differ from the basic method. Come back through the fabric a little ways from your first link as you normally would, but then make a loop that passes through the original ""anchor"" stitch — not the link you just made.


After this, pull the thread through and put the needle back through the hole it came from once again.

, Come back through the fabric below the second link. Pass the needle under both of the previous links. This is crucial — you want the thread to pass under not just the second link, but the second and first links together. When done, put the needle back through the hole it came from as before.


Ignore the original ""anchor"" stitch — we don't need to deal with it any more.

, Continue this pattern to extend your chain. Each time you come up through the fabric, loop your thread under the last two links you've made. If you do this correctly, a thick, ""tight""-looking chain stitch should begin to form.


It takes careful attention to get the pattern down, but once you get it, this stitch isn't difficult. Until it becomes natural, be careful about missing a stitch and looping your new link through just one previous link instead of two — if you don't catch your mistake, this will give your finished product an uneven ""kink"" in the chain.

"
"
Start by bringing the needle up through the fabric.,
Wrap the working thread around the needle.,
""Scoop"" up a short length of fabric.,
Pull the needle over the working thread.,
Repeat as needed.",How to Sew Chain Stitch3," This variant on the basic chain stitch actually looks like a real chain. Unlike the method above, we won't start with a basic chain stitch here. Instead, simply bring the needle from the back side of the fabric to the front.

, Next, bring the needle in front of your working thread (the ""slack"" length of thread that you haven't used yet.) Wrap the working thread one complete turn to form a tight loop around the needle.

, Stick the needle back through the front of the fabric a short distance from where you brought it through. Then, without pulling the thread tight, bring the point of the needle back through the fabric again a short ways down the line.


An easy way to do this is to bring the needle through the fabric at a shallow angle, rather than at a 90-degree angle. This way, you can slip the needle into the fabric and back out again using only the length of the needle, so you won't need to pull on the thread.

, Start pulling the needle to tighten the thread. Make sure the needle travels over the working thread rather than under it. Finally, pull the thread tight.


If you've done everything correctly, at this point you should be left with a stitch that looks like an oval shape or the number 0.

, Though it may not seem like it at first, all you need to do to continue your cable chain stitch is just repeat the steps above. As you lengthen your stitch, you'll eventually get a string of ""0s"" joined by short ""-"" segments that resemble the links in a real chain. To recap, for the rest of the stitch, you'll need to:Wrap the working thread around the needle
Scoop up a short length of fabric by putting the needle through the thread and bringing it back through without tightening the thread.
Pull the needle back over the working thread
Pull to tighten.

Buy strategically.,
Keep a ratio of 1 to 1 when trading cards.,
Hold on to duplicates for later use.,
Trade in baby steps.",How to Collect Pokémon Cards2," If you want to play the card game, you may want to focus on finding certain Pokémon or trainers and building a strong team to challenge other collectors. Pokémon cards can be usually be bought in boxed sets of themed decks, booster packs, and tins.A theme deck will generally have 60 cards but will be more expensive overall. It's a great way to get your collection for playing started because it will give you a wide range of Pokémon, energy cards, trainer and item cards, as well as a decent mix of different card rarities. Booster packs will have about 10 cards in the newer expansions (and around 11 in older ones) and can cost as little as $3 or $4. Tins serve a similar purpose and are a great way to expand your collection., Trading cards with people you play against is a great way to find new cards out in the ""wild"" and you can negotiate trades to expand your team of Pokémon. This maintains that fair deals and no one is being taken advantage of within the trade. Some people make the mistake of trading several of their cards for one rare one they have their eye on and instead end up trading several cards of value for just one good card. Trading uneven amounts of cards is a quick way to lose large chunks of your collection and it's best to swap one at a time., Some people might think that duplicates aren't of any use and just take up space. Instead, think of duplicates as opportunities to trade with other collectors whether in person or online to expand your collection. It's very likely that another collector will have multiples of a card you want and vice versa, so you can swap cards with each other without taking a card from your overall set. Having duplicates can also be beneficial when building a deck and having back-ups when playing the card game.

, The best way to go from owning a low value card to a high value one is to trade up gradually. Start by trading a card for another that is just slightly more valuable than the one you started with. Then, continue to trade that card for a slightly more valuable one each time you trade it. This is also a great way to obtain rare cards without going bankrupt. Selling cards is an option, but trading doesn't require any monetary transactions and you can still end up with a great card."
"
Pick your method of organization.,
Use groups and subgroups when organizing your cards.,
Sort through your cards periodically to make sure that you're maintaining the system you have in place.,
Invest in supplies to help organize and also protect your card collection.,
Protect your cards from the elements.,
Double up on protecting your cards.",How to Collect Pokémon Cards3," Organization should be based on your own preferences such as whether you want to be able to pull out certain Pokémon types for battles or want to keep them in numerical order so you can know what's missing in the set you're collecting. There are several ways to categorize Pokémon cards including:


Type (i.e. grass, ground, fighting, water, fire)
Set
Evolution
Pokédex number- each Pokémon is assigned a number in the master list of Pokémon.
Rarity., You can combine different organizational methods by layering them. For example, you can have a group of all water type Pokémon and then as a subgroup, they are arranged by rarity, going from most rare to the most common card type. It's helpful to keep a master list somewhere easy to find, like the front pocket of a binder, so that you can reference it and locate a card within a group or subgroup quickly.

, As you accumulate cards, you want to make sure that you stay organized so that you know where to find a card when you need it. Label makers are a great way to mark your binders and tins with the groups and subgroups you have chosen. Also, have a separate space for duplicates or similar cards so that your main collection doesn't become cluttered.

, There are several options for storing and preserving your cards. A 3-ring binder can hold sheets of page protectors with special pockets for trading cards. The clear plastic is a great way to display your cards with easy access so you can organize the cards as you collect more. Another option is to buy individual sleeves or toploaders to hold separate cards that can then all be stored in a box or tin. Sleeves help protect from scratches and toploaders are a stiffer plastic sleeve that prevents cards from bending. You can buy binders at office supply stores or online and sheets and sleeves can be found at any hobby store. To cut down on costs, buy in bulk to save money in the long run., Since the cards are made from paper, they are susceptible to becoming damaged and this will decrease their value. Keep your cards safe from these possible risks so that you don't have to worry about losing parts of your collection. Additionally, store your cards in a cool, dry place such as a closet or plastic bin. Avoid rubber bands for holding cards together since the bands can bend the cards and compromise the card structure.


Wear and tear from handling the cards
Water damage
Smoke damage
Food and drink stains
Sunlight and fading from light exposure, As you continue to collect, you'll start to accumulate some valuable cards, such as holographic or rare cards. Put those cards into a sleeve and then put them in a top loader. A binder is good for easy access to your cards, especially if you use them for battling other collectors, but using both a sleeve and toploader will prevent extra dust, water, and handling from ruining your special cards."

Inspect the card for irregularities.,
Hold the card up to a bright light.",How to Collect Pokémon Cards4," Pokémon cards can be found at major stores such as Walmart and Target, as well as hobby stores, comic book and video game stores, and online stores or sites such as Ebay. When buying in bulk online, check the reviews for a website to make sure the seller is reputable. bulk, Pokémon cards have intricate details and fakes can be easy to spot if you know what to look for. A genuine card will have several distinct characteristics:


An accent on the 'e' in 'Pokémon.' The accent needs to be present on both the back and front of the card as well as within any text on the card.
Reasonable HP and attack numbers. Fakes will sometimes have ridiculously high stats.
Font sizes are uniform and a Pokémon's attacks will be in bolded font.
No spelling errors.
Copyright and trademark symbols will be visible.
Real cards will not have grainy or fuzzy images or raised textures on the card.
The energy symbol on a real card will not take up the entire circle it is in. Fake cards have an almost ""bolded"" symbol in the bottom right-hand corner., Fake cards are often made from a flimsier material than the usual lightweight, cardboard type of paper. When holding the card to the light, if the card is translucent or the back image is visible, then you have a fake card."

Keep learning more about collecting postcards.",How to Collect Postcards," The breadth of postcards is so wide that it's probably a good idea to develop your focus early on to avoid having box loads of unsorted postcards and not knowing what to do with them all. Postcards can be collected in many ways but some of the most common approaches are as follows:



Postcards by a particular artist.
Postcards from a particular location or country.
Postcards dating from a particular time.
Postcards with a particular theme such as a specific animal like a cat or wildlife, structures such as tall buildings or bridges, natural wonders such as waterfalls or canyons, household items such as teapots, artwork from museum collections, transport such as trains, trams or planes, beach scenes, Valentine's Day, Christmas, Star Trek, etc. (the possibilities are endless).
Postcards that are humorous, cheeky (risque) or have cartoons on them.;
, For example, if you love horses, then postcards of horses will always appeal to you. All sorts of interests like ballet, rugby, board games, aircraft spotting, museums, dinosaurs, weapons, food, alcohol, etc., are likely to be found on postcards in one way of another. This can add a very interesting dimension to postcard collecting that will bolster your love of your other interest in a unique way.


Some people only collect postcards when they travel. Given the great photos that professional photographers can take of a place you're visiting, it can be a good way to ensure that you have at least one really good photo of the place you've visited! It's also helpful to get postcards that depict different seasons or weather than what you're experiencing on your visit.

, While it's incredibly hard to date many postcards because anyone can print them anywhere and that's precisely how it's always been, there are some factors that can help you determine the era of postcards:1898-1919 is known as the ""Golden Age of Postcards"", when picture postcards were most popular

1901-1906 – undivided backs on picture postcards
1907-1915 – divided backs on picture postcards (in the U.S.A.; most other countries had divided backs a few years earlier, e.g. Canada from 1903)
1915-1930 – white border postcards were common


1930-1950 – linen collectible postcardsPost 1940 postcards were produced as modern chromes, namely color photographs instead of the photo-chromes generated from black and white photos in earlier postcards – early chromes date from the 1940s to the 1960s.
Given that postcards are usually sent within a few years of production, the postmark can be an indicator. Then again, everyone has seen very dusty old postcards that haven't sold for years in some stores, and there is nothing to stop anyone from posting a very old postcard 50 to 100 years later if they feel like it, so the postmark isn't always a good indicator!
If the postcard presents a city, street or other view that can be matched to photos of a certain time, that can help to date the postcard.

, Once you start getting quite serious about collecting postcards, you'll learn that there are quite a few things to take into account when collecting them. As a beginner aiming to have fun with your hobby, simply be aware of these initially and over time, you may want to direct your attention more to the collectible indicators to ensure that you have a postcard collection of the highest quality should you wish to show it at a special event or sell it for good value. Things of importance when collecting any paper collectible such as postcards include condition, age, anything interesting about the postcard such as its age, the artist/photographer, the image, sometimes the printer, and the postcard's rarity. Other things that might be notable include the author of the writing on it, the content of the writing, the address, the stamp/postmark, and any other elements such as the post office marking the postcard as ""prohibited/censored"" due to censorship or war, etc. Any one of these elements alone could cause a particular postcard to be very special and any of these elements could also form the basis of your collection. For example, you might want to collect postcards by famous people or by women from a certain era or that have never been posted and are in perfect condition. In terms of condition, postcards are rated as follows (the first three ratings being for serious vintage postcard collectors):


Mint: This means that the vintage postcard appears as it would have fresh off the printing press. There cannot be any writing, postage marks, creases, bends, etc. on the postcard for it to be in mint condition. They should be stored in acid-free, archival covers and kept safe from being bent.
Near mint: This is almost like mint except for a very minor flaw such as a little yellowing at the edge. There cannot be much of a flaw though or it starts to fall down the list. Again, this should be stored in acid-free, archival covers to protect it for the long term.
Excellent: This is a vintage postcard that is in excellent condition, so no tears or wear. It can be postmarked or written on, provided the postcard itself is still in perfect shape. As above, keep this in acid-free, archival covers.
Very good: This postcard is often mailed, postmarked and written upon but it has very few signs of wear and is definitely one to be proud of in a collection.
Good: By this stage, the postcard has lived a little and shows signs of its journey. There may be bent corners, a fold, creases, faded colors, etc. This one is unlikely to be worth much unless it's particularly unusual, rare or was written by something famous.
Fair to poor: The rest of the postcards in their grimy, beaten up, bent, crushed, creased and other states. The reason you keep them? Mostly because they're sentimental, because they complete a set, because you like them anyway, and so forth. Just don't expect to make a fortune from them any day soon! Even so, a rare card or a card with great content can be worth a considerable amount even if damaged and in some cases certain forms of wear may even add to the aesthetic appeal of a card (the moral is go with what you like without worrying that it isn't expensive).

, It's a good use of time to browse through postcards for sale on auction sites such as eBay. Doing this will give you an idea of what's available as well as giving you an idea of the prices the postcards are worth and what you can expect to pay for them. However, at this stage don't get hung up on high values or you won't develop your own style and taste. Instead, focus on buying what you like for now and developing your own theme. Once you feel more confident that this is the hobby of choice for you and that you want to spend more money on it, then you can get serious about spending more money on particular types of postcards. Until then, just enjoy the thrill of adding to your collection for very low prices!

, Real photo postcards were popular in the Golden Age (less so later). They are usually black and white and look like photographs, because that's what they are. Unlike the majority of early postcards, which were lithographed (sometimes called ""lithos"" for short), ""real photo"" cards were photographs developed directly onto special postcard backs. Lithographed cards, by contrast, were usually made from photographs but they were mechanically printed in printing presses. You can tell the difference by looking closely at the image: if it is a lithograph card the image will be composed of tiny dots (like a photograph in a newspaper) while the ink in a real photograph will be continuous. Real photo cards were usually produced in very small quantities, because they had to be developed in a darkroom, one by one. Often they were family photos or photos of local events produced by a local photographer for immediate sale. On average, a real photo postcard will sell for more than a lithographed postcard -- typically 5 to 10 times more. So, when you see one box of views of your town selling for $1-$5 and another box selling for $10-$50, chances are that the reason for the difference is that the first box contains lithographs and the second contains real photos.

, The places for finding postcards are many and varied but the sources will be determined by how you have narrowed down your collection criteria. For example, if you're not fussed about the age, quality or provenance of the postcard, you'll find postcards literally everywhere you go from newspaper stands on the street to your grandma's attic. It gets more complicated the more you narrow down your interests and the more you seek older, antique postcards but there are still many avenues for finding them even then. In particular, the places you're likely to find postcards include:


Stores that sell magazines, newspapers, stationery, candies, etc. will often carry modern, current postcards. These will usually be souvenir postcards aimed at tourists but you never know what you mind find, so be sure to look wherever you are.
Check out truck stops, gas stations, department stores, souvenir stores, motel lobbies, anywhere that is heavily visited by tourists. Any place associated with tourists, travelers, traveling etc. will probably have current, modern postcards.
Many museums, art galleries, zoos, national parks, theme parks, science centers, aquariums, space observatories, and other display, learning and entertainment areas often carry modern, current postcards.
Look online for a very wide variety of postcards both new and old to antique. Auction sites, antique sites and postcard seller sites will provide you with a wide array of choices.
Visit a postcard trade show. Here you'll find nothing but postcards!
Visit antique stores, flea markets, garage and yard sales, secondhand bookstores and other similar stores for older postcards. Auction houses may also sell postcards, and if you're after someone's existing collection, an auction house or an art or vintage collectibles auction are good places to start.
Ask family members for old, unwanted postcards and go through boxes of stored papers in the attic to see if anyone has stored any over the years that have been sent to them or that they've collected on trips away.
Ask anyone you know who travels or is going on vacation to send you home at least one postcard. This can be a lovely way to treasure their words as well as the postcard.
For a beginner collector, bulk lot purchases of postcards can be a lot of fun. You never know what you might get in such a mix but it'll be fun rummaging through it and it might spark more creative ideas for how to put together your postcard collection.

, It's easier to check the condition of a postcard in a store than online and yet it's likely that many of your cards will be internet purchases. In this case, be sure to seek as thorough a photo as possible of the card's condition before buying. If you can't see all of the condition or the description is very poor, either don't purchase it or only purchase it if it's exceptionally cheap. Some of the things to be aware of when purchasing cards include:


Cleanliness of the card: This is not about whether or not it has been written on. It's about the splotches, marks, grime and grease that builds up on old paper items over time. Look for postcards that are clean and free of age or grime marks where possible. It won't always be possible but it's worth aiming high where you can.
Edges: Try to find postcards that have even and unbent edges and haven't been torn or dog eared.
Content: It's always preferable if you can actually read what has been written on the postcard if it has writing. That makes it a lot more enjoyable and gives a sense of history behind the postcard.
Markings: Mostly this is about the postmark. The more legible, the better and if it has a date and location that can be read, a lot can be learned about the postcard.
Avoid: Things to avoid include moldy postcards (they will never become un-moldy), really badly battered about unless there is a sentimental or content reason for getting the postcard, foxing (spots and age marks) and grease marks (these detract from the overall look), stains such as blood, grime or water, too many folds or creases, tears, etc. If it looks tattered, the only reason to get it is because it's rare, what is written on it is worth keeping or you've fallen in love with it (but not if it's moldy).

, The manner in which you keep the postcards is important for safeguarding their quality over the coming years. For the really old and the valuable postcards, store in archival, acid-free covers available from hobby stores, stamp and postcard retailers and online. These will keep dust, grime and stains off the postcards and the paper will be safe from acidity. Keep the cards stored flat and in a place where they cannot be crushed, bent or warped. Ensure that the environment is dry and cool and not humid and that there is no possibility of insect damage. If you have children (and/or pets), store the postcards out of reach, at least until the children are old enough to know how to handle them properly. Most of all, try to find a way that makes it easy to see and enjoy your postcard collection as often as you like. Some ideas include:



Scrapbooks are ideal for creating themed collections and can be the perfect vehicle for protecting, displaying and explaining your postcard collection. Indeed, people have kept postcards in albums since Victorian times, so this will be carrying on a fine old tradition.
Another great way to keep a record of your postcard collection is to take digital images and post them into an online collection for all to see. It will help you to keep track of the postcards and many other people can enjoy your collection too!

, This article has been intended to aid the beginning hobbyist or sentimental collector to get started on honing choices, organizing the collection and learning the basics. More in-depth knowledge should be pursued through talking to other collectors and reading widely in the field of deltiology and about collecting in general.

, J.L. Mashburn publishes new editions of ""The Postcard Price Guide"" regularly. He also publishes guides for ""topicals,"" or postcards featuring a specific subject, such as sports, Americana, fantasy and more.

, The following things will affect the sale and the marketing of your postcards:


If the postcard collection is filled with topicals, it may need to be sold together to get a higher price. This means that the postcard collector is dedicated to 1 kind of card, which may include rare cards. If the collection is region specific, such as the New York skyscrapers, you may want to sell them in or around New York.
If any postcards originate before World War II, they will be more valuable. Set those postcards aside from modern versions and sell them individually.
If the postcards are in poor condition, but originate after World War II, you will likely want to sell them together, in bulk. Buyers may want them for reuse in art or other projects.

, Gather information about how much similar postcards are going for on the resale market. In general, you will be offered 10 to 50 percent of this price.


Pay attention to the selling prices, rather than the asking prices on sites like eBay. There are usually discrepancies, which can help you calculate a good price.

, This is a common way to sell entire collections or individual postcards because it reaches a wide base of customers and it is a fairly secure place to sell. Make sure you enter the photographer, publisher and series number of the postcard if it is listed before posting the card for sale.


It is a good idea to pay the extra money to post 2 pictures if you are selling individual postcards. The buyers will want to see the condition of the front and the back. List any messages, stamps or postmarks on the back side of the card. Be honest with the condition, or you may find your postcards returned from the buyer.
Place a short description of the image in the title of your auction post. Your post may say ""Empire State Building Postcard 1933."" This will lead people who invest in topical cards straight to your auction.

, This craft website also boasts a ""vintage"" section. You can sell a whole postcard collection as vintage ephemera, or specific cards. Some sellers frame vintage postcards and display them as art.

, You can either consign your cards to a particular auction house, where they will take a percentage of the profits, or you can sell to them directly. This may be the best option if your collection is worth more than $500.


If you consign your cards to an auction house, you will sign an agreement with them, then ship the cards securely. Upon receipt, they will describe the cards and tell you the lot in which they will be auctioned off. They are likely to split the collection into valuable cards to be sold singly and less valuable that will be sold with other cards in bulk. An auction house will often ask for 30 percent of the profits.
If you sell your cards to the auction house outright, they will ask you to ship them the cards. They will offer you what they feel is a fair price after perusing the collection. If you accept, you will be paid. If you do not, you will likely be asked to pay for postage.

, Many sellers run low-cost websites that list their postcards in detail. The website should have a contact form and accept payments through PayPal, in order to appear as a trusted seller.


When creating your website, pay special attention to meta tags and meta descriptions. A meta tag lists words that people will use to search for postcards. A meta description is what appears when the search results are listed.

, This is a form of income, and unless you did the transaction in cash, it is already recorded somewhere in your financial data.

Add water.Gradually add clean water to the dry ingredients.,
Enclose the plastic dinosaurs.Take each plastic dinosaur and wrap it in some of the dough.,
Let the eggs dry.It may take several days for your dinosaur eggs to dry hard to the touch, depending on how wet the dough was, and on how high the humidity in your area is.,
Crack the eggs.The thoroughly dry eggs can be cracked open using a hammer to “hatch” the dinosaur inside.",How to Make Dinosaur Eggs2," Once the dough dries, you can have fun cracking the eggs open to “hatch” the toys. Small plastic dinosaurs can be found in many toy stores.

, Make sure that the dry ingredients are thoroughly and evenly mixed. This will make the base for a dough.

, Stir as you pour just a little bit at a time. The exact amount of water to add depends on the type of dirt you are using and the humidity in your area. In any case, stir in enough water that the dry ingredients stick together so that they can be formed into egg-shaped clumps.

, Make sure to completely enclose each dinosaur. Using your hands, form the clump of dough into an egg shape.


You can dip your fingers in water and rub them over the eggs to smooth them out, if you want., Leave them in a safe, dry place while you wait.


Dry your eggs in the sun if it is warm in your area, but bring them in at night.
Rotating your eggs occasionally can help them dry evenly.
You can speed the drying process by placing the eggs in an oven set to 200 degrees Fahrenheit for approximately 4 hours, turning them every half hour. After the first hour, set the eggs on a rack on top of a baking sheet to help them dry more evenly., You can have fun by hiding the dinosaur eggs in your yard or a park, then letting children hunt for them and crack them open.

Use coffee grounds instead of dirt.Coffee grounds can provide a nice texture for your dough, and are more sanitary than dirt.,
Make fizzing dough.You can add a fun fizzy factor by using 1 cup of baking soda (instead of 1 cup of salt) in your dinosaur egg dough.As you crack open the dried eggs, set them in a dish of vinegar (or citric acid).The baking soda will react with the vinegar, causing fizzing and foaming.

,
Shape the eggs using plastic eggs.You can create dinosaur eggs by filling plastic Easter eggs with whatever dough mixture you are using.,
Make frozen dinosaur eggs.Take a small plastic dinosaur and place it inside an empty balloon.",How to Make Dinosaur Eggs3," Simply follow a recipe for dinosaur egg dough, but replace some or all of the dirt with coffee grounds.

,, Once the plastic egg is full, close it to squeeze out excess dough. Open it again, and remove the dough egg. Let the eggs dry thoroughly, and crack them open. While these eggs will be relatively small, they will have a uniform appearance.

, Fill the balloon with water using a faucet or funnel, then tie it closed. Place it in the freezer. Once it is fully frozen, cut the balloon away to reveal a frozen dinosaur egg! Have fun melting the eggs to “hatch"" the dinosaurs inside.

Pick your method.,
Pick your clay.,
Prepare yourself and the area.",How to Make Ceramics1," This is very important to do first as it determines what kind of clay you'll be working with. Don't rule out clays that need a kiln -- you can buy a small one for your home if you're serious about this hobby. Here is the rundown on the methods and varieties of clay used with each:


Oven bake, air dry, or polymer clay. These do not require use of a kiln; they either air dry or are baked in a standard oven. Due to expense, they are best used for small items such as jewelry, ornaments, etc. The oven and air dry clays are similar in look and feel to normal clay. Polymer clay comes in many bright colors (kind of like playdoh!), and can be made into beautiful designs which become plastic-like when fired.
Handbuilding with standard clay. The possibilities are endless for hand built ceramics. It does, however, require the use of a kiln. But otherwise the investment needed is very low. Clay itself is inexpensive, about $6-10 per 25 lb bag. A rolling pin, newspapers or cloth, and other ordinary household items are all that are required. With a book on handbuilding, most anyone should be able to start making pieces on their own.
Wheel throwing with standard clay. Again, a kiln is required. And once you are an experienced thrower you will undoubtedly want a large kiln, since you will produce pieces much more quickly than in handbuilding. You can learn to throw from books or even better, videotapes, and some people do, but it is difficult. Most people with no experience, buying a wheel and trying it out on their own, would get frustrated and give up. However, if you are patient, you can build your throwing skills, never firing anything (a large kiln is expensive -- but maybe you have access to one?) but instead recycling the clay to be thrown again. It is tempting to want to finish each piece at the beginning, because you are very proud of it, but soon you will hate the look of those early pieces! So not even firing them at all would be a fine strategy.;
, Now that you know what method you'll be employing, you can choose your clay. Most clays require a kiln, but many novelty brands will fire in a kitchen stove. If you just want to play with wet clay, don't even worry about firing it. A basic rule: wet clay and dry clay will not work together properly -- just make sure your clay is the same consistency.









If you are going to fire your clay, choose between high and low fire.

Low fire is usually best for bright colors and detailed decoration. The glazes are very stable at that temperature, the colors stay bright and they don’t move during firing. The drawback is that the pieces are not fully vitrified (the clay isn’t fully fused) so you are counting on the glaze to make the piece waterproof. This makes them less suitable to dinnerware or items holding water. The glaze is more likely to chip because it hasn’t interacted with the clay as in high fire. However, if the proper clay and glaze are used, it can be quite strong. The clay used for low fire is called Earthenware.
Mid to High fire uses clays that are called Stoneware or Porcelain. Bright colors can still be gotten in oxidation kilns (electric kilns), less so in reduction kilns (gas kilns). Pieces are very strong, when fired to temperature the clay is waterproof on its own, and can be used for dinnerware and ovenware. Porcelain can be made very thin and still maintain strength. Glazes at these temperatures interact with the clay bodies giving speckled, individualized pieces that many people find interesting. The glaze typically moves (a lot or a little) so detailed designs would get blurred., Working with clay can get a bit messy, especially if children are involved. Cover any area that you don't want to get exposed -- lay a tarp or newspapers on the floor or do your work in the garage or other non-living space.









Never wear clothes that you don't want to get dirty or stained. If you have long hair, pull it back. It'll be less messy and won't get in your eyes.

Prep your clay.,
Start the wheel.,
Center the clay.,
Form your shape.",How to Make Ceramics2," Air bubbles can be disastrous to an otherwise perfect product, so get them out before you start working. Knead or wedge your clay in small amounts -- start with the size of both your fists.









Knead the clay like you would a loaf of bread, mold it into a ball and then slam it against a piece of plaster (it's good for absorbing moisture). Do this repeatedly until the bubbles have ceased. If you're not sure, split the ball in half with a wire and monitor the insides.

, Throw the clay with some force onto the center. Since you're just starting out, stick to a large handful of clay for right now. Wet your hands with a bowl of nearby water and start shaping the clay.









Start coning the mass of clay. Brace it between your two palms are start squeezing upward.

For each step of working with the clay, make sure that your elbows are pressed into your inner thighs or on your knees -- whatever is comfortable. This will help steady your hands as they work.



, This is a method of spinning it until it's perfectly smooth with no bumps or wobbles. Once you have your cone shape, you're ready.









Push your tower down with one hand and keep it stable with the other hand. If you're right-handed, push it down with your right. Most of the pressure comes from the top.
Once the clay is in a wider lump at the bottom, start applying pressure on the sides, evening them out. A bit of clay may accumulate on your left hand; that's normal -- just place it off to the side.

, The specific instructions end here -- each piece (bowl, pot, etc.) will be formed differently. But regardless of your piece, make your movements deliberate and slow, letting the wheel make ~5 repetitions before you finish each movement. Make sure all 360 degrees of the clay receive the same treatment, keeping the work round. Wipe away any water that accumulates with a sponge.









When you are done, clean up your piece with the wooden knife, and smooth the surface with a rib.

Note: If you mess up and the clay is all twisted, unfortunately you probably shouldn't just try to reshape it into a blob and start over. The clay does not reset and will not cooperate well at all on the next try.

Make sure that your clay has no bubbles in it.,
Pinch, coil or slab.",How to Make Ceramics3," If put in the kiln, this will probably make it explode. As outlined in the Wheel Throwing section, slam your clay on plaster (absorbs wetness) and knead it like bread.


If you'd like to check the insides to be sure, take a wire and cut it in half. If bubbles are still present, persist.

, When you're hand building, there are generally three methods you can employ. Each creates a very different look. Slab works best for large pieces.










Pinch pots: Begin a pinch pot by forming a lump of clay into a smooth sphere that fits the size of the hand. This method is similar to the way the Native Americans shaped clay into useful pots. While holding the sphere of clay, press the thumb into the center of the ball, half-way to the bottom. While revolving the ball in one hand, press the walls out evenly with the thumb into the inside and the fingers on the outside. Smooth the surface with a damp sponge.

Coil Method: Coils of clay can be used to build bowls, vases and other forms in various shapes and sizes. Keeping the fingers flat, form the clay into sausage shapes, then roll into ropes 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) thick. Make a shallow dish with the pinch pot method and turn up-side down to serve as a foot of base. Place a coil along the edge of the foot. Dampen the fingers and join the next coil to it, with a little pressure. Keep adding coils. Coils may be pressed with the fingers or a tool on both the inside and outside to create interesting texture.

Slab Method: Place two strips of wood on canvas a little further apart than the width of the finished slabs. Working on a textured fabric will leave imprints on the clay slab. Place clay on the cloth between the strips of wood and roll out. Use a pointed tool to trim the slab of clay to desired size. You may make paper patterns to follow if a form that has a number of sides is desired. Rub a wet finger over the edges to be joined and score with a tool. Roll out a thin coil of sticky clay and place it along one edge. Press the two edges together. Slabs of clay may be placed over rocks, bowls, plastic forms etc. to create interesting shapes. As the clay dries, it shrinks away from the form but retains the shape of the form.If it is a medium or larger piece, make it hollow. Solid clay takes an eternity to dry and will explode in a firing most of the time.

Fire your clay at least once.,
Choose your glaze.,
Choose your method.",How to Make Ceramics4," After this, it can be glazed! Get access to a kiln if you don't have your own and let the pros take care of it. If you do have your own, make doubly sure you know how to appropriately work it and what your piece requires.


Different clays react differently to heat. Read the directions on the clay's packaging and do some research online. Take into consideration your piece's size, too.

, As with every other step, there are a multitude of options. Each kind will give you a slightly different look.


Liquid: You can purchase commercial glazes and underglazes in liquid form which are usually formulated for brushing. All you need to apply the glaze is a brush. Some glazes are difficult to brush on smoothly; as a result, you will see brush marks. Others will melt enough to erase the brush marks.
Dry: You can purchase commercial glazes in dry form, which are usually formulated for dipping, pouring, or spraying. In addition to a brush, you will need a bucket, some water, something to stir with, and a mask to avoid breathing the dust. The advantage of dipping is that you get a more even coating of glaze, and you can do interesting things you can’t do with a brush, such as double dip to get different colors on the same piece. Spraying is usually done by more advanced people since it requires good ventilation, a gun, a compressor, a booth, etc.
Make your own: This is the most advanced form of glazing. Using recipes, you buy raw materials and mix them. In addition to the other things, you will need recipes which may be obtained from books and web sites. You also need the chemicals which make up your glaze, a scale, a sieve, and a temperament which allows experimentation. Sometimes your glazes won’t turn out quite right. You will have to learn how to modify those glazes to solve whatever problem you’re having. Other times they will be stunning., You guessed it -- there a handful of ways you can glaze your item, too. Here's a fairly exhaustive list of the ways you can bring out the colors in your art:










Dipping:If you have a whole bunch of pottery to glaze, dipping will be the quickest method to employ. You simply dip it in the glaze (it should have the consistency of heavy cream) for about three seconds and set it aside. The coat will surely be even.

Pouring: If you're looking to glaze the inside, just pour the glaze into the pot, leave it for three seconds, and pour the glaze back into the bucket. If you're worried about excess, you can rid of it in plenty of ways.

Pouring is a viable method for coating the outside, too. It's often used a second, thinner layer. The two layers then interact, resulting in a colorful glaze with texture, shading, and visual depth.



Brushing: If you bought your glaze ready-to-use, it probably will go on well with a brush. If the glaze is thick, you're good to go -- it's designed for the purpose of camouflaging brush marks. If you like the look brush marks give your piece, vary the thickness of the coat when applying. Use a synthetic sable brush to get the job done.

If you want an even, opaque coat, use a big brush and apply the recommended number of coats +1. Put the piece on a wheel and spin it slowly while applying the paint to give it a very even finish.



Sponging: To sponge, dip your pot into a layer of the glaze you'd like to use for the background. Next, use a natural sea sponge dipped in another color of glaze to achieve your desired pattern. Commercial sponges from a craft supplier, cut into various shapes of your liking, can also be used to obtain interesting effects. If you have time, experiment by mixing and matching various shapes and colors to see what sort of combined effects are most appealing to you.

Etching: You'll need at least two different glazes here, preferably ones which you've previously test-fired together to make sure they give pleasing results when overlapped. Start off by dipping your pot in the lighter of the two glazes, then let dry. Dip again, this time in the darker glaze. Once it has dried, take a mini-ribbon tool and gently carve a pattern in the top layer of the glaze, exposing the lighter glaze underneath. Depending on how careful you are as you carve out the design, very intricate patterns may be achieved. Once fired, the carved patterns will appear in the color of the first glaze applied, surrounded by a ""background"" of the combined layered glaze color.

Stamping: Obtain some florist's foam (the stuff used to hold professional flower arrangements in place) from your local craft supplier. Then draw a pattern or design onto the surface of the foam. Carve out the design with your mini-ribbon tool, then dip the block into slip or glaze and use it as a stamp to decorate wide, flat forms which have already been dipped into a contrasting glaze and allowed to dry.

Wax Resist: Dunk your whole pot into a light glaze; paint on a pattern with a wash like cobalt oxide (blue) or iron oxide (brown); then carefully paint wax resist over the wash pattern you just painted. When the wax is dry, dunk your pot into a second color. If you go over the line so you're waxing on top of the white, you'll have three glazes (white, cobalt, plus final). Extra detail can be achieved by carving through the second glaze.

Tape Resist: For crisp, fine lines with sharp edges and angles, use thin masking tape instead of wax to achieve your resist pattern. This is done by glazing the entire pot, letting dry, and applying the masking tape in the pattern you desire. Dip the pot again, let dry, and remove the masking tape to expose the glaze underneath.Pay attention to firing temperatures on glaze bottles. If it is a high fire glaze, and you used a lower temperature clay, your piece will melt in the superheated kiln.

Poke holes into the beads using a tapestry needle or a toothpick.,
Let the beads dry.,
Paint the beads using acrylic paint and let them dry.,
Consider sealing the beads with lacquer.,
Use the beads.",How to Make Clay Beads1," Air-dry clay can get messy, it's a good idea to protect the table you will be working on. You can simply spread out some newspaper or a cheap, plastic tablecloth. If your project is very small, you can even work on a tray or baking sheet. This will make cleaning up much easier.


This method will work for stone clay, natural clay, and paper clay.;
, Most air-dry clays come in big blocks. You likely won't need the entire block, so just cut off a small amount and wrap the rest of the clay back up in its packaging. This way, the rest of clay won't dry out.


Most air-dry clays will come wrapped in plastic. If yours came in a tub, simply put the lid back on.
Is it better to cut off less clay than you think you might need. A little bit goes a long way, and you can always cut more clay off later.

, If you are going to make ball-shaped beads, cut the clay up into small, evenly-sized cubes. It will be easier to shape them later on. If you are going to make tube or disc-shaped beads, roll your clay out into a tube; try to make it between the thickness of a pencil and your finger.


Make the clay cubes between the size of a pea and a blueberry. Larger, grape-sized beads may take too long to dry.
If your clay is difficult to work with, dip your fingers into a cup of water and smooth them over the clay. The water will help soften it.

, If you are making round beads, roll the cubes between your palms. If you are making tube or disc-shaped beads, cut the clay roll to the length you need using a sharp knife.


For discs, try to make them about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) thick.
For tubes, try to make them between ½ and one inch (1.27 and 2.54 centimeters) thick. You can leave the cut edges as they are or taper them using your fingers.

, Dip your finger in water and run it over the bead's surface until it is smooth. Keep doing this until you get the texture you want. Remember, once the clay dries, it will be very difficult to change or repair it.

, Use a tapestry needle for smaller beads, and a toothpick for larger beads. Be careful not to smooth the beads.


If you made tube-shaped beads, poke the hole from top to bottom—the flat parts, not the curved.
If you made disk-shaped beads, poke the hole from the side—the narrow edge part. This way, when you string the beads, they will look like circles.

, How long it takes will depend on how warm or humid it is. It will also depend on how large your beads are; larger/thicker beads will take longer to dry. Most beads will need about a day to dry fully. The clay will lighten in color as it dries. For example, most grayish clays will turn white when they dry, and red/brown clays will turn a lighter shade.

, Stick them back onto the needle/toothpick, and place the needle/toothpick between two level objects. This will allow the beads to hang freely and allow you to paint them from all sides. If you wish to add designs to your beads, paint the beads a solid color first, let the paint dry, then add your designs. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Dots
Stripes
Simple flowers
Swirls

, This will not only give the beads a nice finish, it will also protect the paint. You can spray the beads with an acrylic sealer, or paint them with a clear acrylic sealer. For a glazed look, choose something with a glossy or high-gloss finish. For a natural look, choose a matte, semi-matte, or satin finish.

, You can string them onto beading cord or elastic, and wear them as jewelry. You can also use them to make key chains, charms, and bookmark dangles.

Take a large lump of air drying or firing clay.,
Mold part of the clay into a ball about an inch and a half in diameter.

,
Flatten the ball into a circle about a fourth of an inch thick (the base of the pot).

,
Roughen the top edge.

,
Use a brush dipped in water to moisten the top.

,
Roll a separate piece of clay between your hands or on the top of the table to form a long, narrow “snake.”

,
Wind the snake along the top edge of the pot’s base.

,
Make more snakes from clay and repeat this several times, winding the snakes on top of each other until the pots are about three inches high.

,
Smooth together the areas where the snakes touch each other, including where the first snake touches the pot’s base.,
Rub the surface smooth with a smooth rock, a shell, or the back of a spoon.,
Use a scallop shell, a piece of corncob, or string pressed into the soft clay to produce texture.

,
To scratch a design on the walls of the pot, let the pot dry a little.

,
Carve a design on the walls with a sharp stick once it is firm but still damp.

,
Let the pots dry for three or four days, or bake them at medium temperature for two or three hours.

,
Once the pots have dried, decorate them with tempera paints.",How to Make Anasazi Pottery,";
,,,,,,,, Do this by holding one hand against the inside of the pot to support the wall, while shaping the outside of the pot with your finger at the same spot. When smoothing the sides of the pot, try to keep the walls of the pot the same thickness.

, The clay has to be moist if the walls are to be textured.

,,,,, You can decorate the inside, outside, or both.

Make sure your hands and work surface are clean.,
Consider having some baby wipes close by.,
Cut off a small amount of clay and knead it.,
Shape your clay.,
Set your clay aside if it becomes too soft.,
Poke holes using a toothpick or tapestry needle.,
Consider using a soft paintbrush to smooth out any finger prints.,
Place the pieces on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake the clay.,
Use sandpaper to smooth out any uneven edges once the clay cools.,
Consider coating the clay with glaze.,
Use the beads.",How to Make Clay Beads2," Polymer clay is very good at picking up dirt and specks of dust. Wash your hands with soap and water. Wipe down your work surface with some household cleaner and a paper towel.

, Some colors, such as red, stain skin very easily. Other colors, such as white, pick up stains. If you are working with several different colors, wipe your hands clean with the baby wipes.

, Most polymer clays will be hard when you first get them, but they will soften up the more you work with them. In general, the solid colors will require more kneading than the glittery or pearly colors.


If your clay is too hard to work with, consider working in some clay conditioner or clay softener. You can usually buy it in the same aisle that sells polymer clay.

, Polymer clay is great in that it does not require water to be smoothed. It also does not harden or dry unless you bake it in the oven. Take your time to create your beautiful beads. Here are some shaping ideas to get you started:


To create a sphere: roll a small amount of clay between your palms until it is smooth and round.
To create discs: roll your clay into a thin cylinder or tube shape, about the thickness of a pencil. Use a sharp blade to cut the cane into discs.
To create tapered tubes: roll your clay into a thin cylinder, about the thickness of a pencil. Cut the cane into ½ to one inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) pieces. Use your fingers to pinch the ends of each mini-tube.
Consider making a little animal shaped bead. Keep the design simple.

, Polymer clay will soften the more you work with it. Sometimes, it may even become sticky and mushy. When this happens, the best thing to do is to set it aside for 10 to 15 minutes. You can also let the clay cool down in the fridge.

, If the clay is too soft and starts to lose its shape as you poke the needle through it, set it aside or stick it in the fridge. Let the clay sit for about 15 minutes until it firms up again. Once the clay is firm, you can try poking the holes again.

, Polymer clay picks up fingerprints very easily. These can be sanded out once you bake the clay, or they can be brushed out with a soft paintbrush. Simply brush the surface of the beads until the finger prints disappear. You do not need to use water.

, Different brands will require different baking times. Refer to the packaging or the manufacturer's website for exact baking times. Most polymer clays will bake at 275 °F (135 °C) for 15 minutes per ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) thickness.

, After you take the clay out of the oven, it will be very hot. Let the clay cool down before you touch it. If you see any sharp or jagged edges, smooth them away with some fine-grit sandpaper. The clay may turn chalky when you do this. This is just dust. Simply rinse the clay under running water, and pat it dry with a paper towel.

, Slide the beads back onto the toothpick or tapestry needle. Set the toothpick or tapestry needle down between two objects, so that the bead hangs freely. You can either spray or paint the beads with a clear glaze. Let the glaze dry and cure fully before you move the beads; if you use them too soon, the glaze may turn sticky. This may take two to four hours.

, You can string them onto clear beading elastic to make jewelry. You can also use them to make bookmark tassels or key chains.

Use the mold.",How to Make a Silicone Mold1," The water should be about room temperature—not too warm and not too cold. It should be deep enough for you to stick your hand into., You can use just about any type of liquid soap, including: body wash, dish soap, and hand soap. Keep stirring until the soap has completely dissolved and no streaks remain.Plan on using about 1 part soap to 10 parts water.You can also liquid glycerin. The glycerin will react with the silicone and cause it to clump together., Purchase a tube of pure silicone from the home improvement store; make sure it is not the quick-set kind. Squeeze enough of the silicone into the bowl to cover your desired item with.Construction silicone may also be labeled as silicone caulk.
If your tube of silicone did not come with a syringe, you will need to purchase a caulking gun, insert the tube, cut the end off, then poke a hole in the tip., Put on a pair of plastic gloves, and reach into the water. Grab the silicone with your fist and squish it together. Knead it until it is no longer sticky while keeping it under the water. This will take about 5 minutes., Begin by rolling the putty into a ball between your palms. Press it against a flat surface, and lightly push down on it. It still needs to be thicker than the item you will be molding.If the silicone is sticky, coat your hands and work surface with a thin layer of your liquid soap., Make sure that you are pressing the item with the design side face-down into the putty. Gently press the edges of the mold against the item so that no gaps remain., Silicone will never turn rock-solid; it will always remain flexible. Simply wait a few hours for the silicone to turn rigid enough so that you can still flex it, but no longer dent it., Take the mold by the edges, and bend it backwards and away from the item. The item should loosen or pop out on its own. Tilt the mold upside-side to tip the item out., Fill the mold with clay, then pull the clay out, and let it dry. You can also try to use resin in this mold as well, but let it cure and harden first."

Squeeze some of the silicone out into a disposable dish. You will need enough to cover whatever you wish to mold.You may also find construction silicone labeled as silicone caulk. Make sure that it is not the quick-set type.
If the silicone did not come with a syringe, you will need to get a caulking gun first. Insert the tube into the gun, cut the end off, then poke a hole in the tip., If you can't find any cornstarch, try cornflour or potato starch instead. Keep the box handy; you might need to use more.If you want a more colorful mold, add a few drops of acrylic paint. This will not make the mold any more or less effective., Keep kneading until the silicone and cornstarch come together and form a putty. It may be dry and crumbly at first, but keep kneading. If it is too sticky, add some more cornstarch into it.You may have some cornstarch leftover in your dish; this is fine. The silicone will have picked up all the cornstarch it needed.

, Start by rolling the silicone putty into a ball between your palms. Next, place it on a smooth surface, and gently press down on it to flatten it slightly. It still needs to be thicker than the item you wish to mold., Make sure that you are pressing it design-side-down into the mold, and that the back is visible. Use your fingers to push the edges of the mold against the item; you do not want to see any gaps., This will only take about 20 minutes or so. You are ready for the next step when the mold is rigid. It should still be flexible, but you should not be able to dent it or form it., Hold the silicone mold by the edges, and gently bend it back and away from your item. Flip the mold over to pop the item out. If you need to, use your fingers to pry the item out., You can push pieces of wet clay into them, then pull them out and let them dry. You can also pour resin into the mold, let the resin cure, then pop it out as well. De-mold any castings the same way you de-molded your initial object."

Most kits will contain two containers labeled ""Part A"" and ""Part B."" Sometimes, you have to purchase them separately.

Do not mix the silicone yet.

, Find a cheap, plastic food container made from thin plastic. Use a craft blade to cut out the bottom.Don't worry about how neat or jagged it is; this will eventually be the top of your mold.

Choose a container that is a little larger than the object you want to make a mold of.

, Remove the lid from the container. Cut several long strips of packaging tape, and lay them across the top. Overlap strip by about ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). Leave a couple inches/centimeters of tape hanging over all sides of the container.Run your finger along the rim to create a tight seal.
Make sure that there are no gaps, or the silicone will pour out.

, Once you fill the container with silicone, there is a small chance that some may leak out from under the tape. This will kept prevent the silicone from leaking out all the way and ruining your work surface., Place the container onto a flat, stable surface with the cut/open side facing up. Place your items into the box, and press them against the tape. Do not let the items touch the side of the container or each other. Also, make sure that the design portion of your item is facing up, and the back is pressed against the tape.Flat-backed items work the best for this.
Wipe the items clean beforehand, if necessary.

, You will always have mix Part A and Part B together. Some types of silicone are supposed to be measured by volume, while others need to be measured by weight. Read the instructions that came with your silicone closely, then measure them accordingly.

Pour the silicone into the cup included with your kit. If your kit did not come with a cup, pour the silicone into a plastic, disposable cup.
You need enough silicone to cover your items by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters).

, You can do this with a skewer, a popsicle stick, or even a plastic fork, spoon, or knife. Keep stirring until the color is even, and no streaks or swirls remain., Use your stirring utensil to help scrape out any excess silicone so that you don't waste any. The silicone should cover the top of your item by at least ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). If you make it too thin, the silicone mold may rip., How long this takes depends on the type brand you are using. Some brands are ready to use in a few hours, while others need to be left overnight. Refer to the instructions that came with your silicone kit for more specific curing times. Do not touch or move the mold during this time., Once the silicone has cured and turned rigid, peel the tape away from the box. Gently slide the silicone mold out. You may notice thin ""feathers"" if silicone around your mold. If these bug you, trim them off with a pair of scissors or a craft blade., The items you placed into the box will be stuck inside the silicone. Gently bend the silicone back to pop the items out. It is a little like remolding ice cubes from an ice cube tray., You can now fill the cavities with resin, clay, or even chocolate (if the silicone was food grade). If you used clay, you can pop the pieces out while the clay is still wet. If you used resin, however, you must allow the resin to cure completely before removing it."

Check the quality of the cotton net tulle fabric when used for embroidering.,
Cut out pattern shapes before treating the tulle with liquid fabric stabiliser.,
Add liquid stabilizer to the fabric.,
Test embroider.,
Once the embroidery project has been completed, prepare the piece for cutting away excess fabric:


Treat each area to be cut with a non-fraying product.",How to Prepare Fabric for Lace Embroidery," It is important to check the cotton net tulle prior to embroidering to see if requires cleaning or not. If you are certain of the quality of the fabric, there will probably be no need to wash it. If, however, you are not sure of its quality, be sure to wash and iron the cotton net tulle thoroughly prior to using. If you do need to wash it:


Wash the fabric gently by hand.
Avoid wringing it.
Dry it out of direct sunlight.
Iron with a low heat. Place a thin towel over the top of it until it sits flat.;
, Note that the embroidery work can alter the shape of the fabric. If you are embroidering the entire pattern piece (not just portions of it), it is wise to cut out the pattern shape wider in size than the pattern requires or suggests. This will provide you with plenty of additional give, and you can cut and reshape the fabric after embroidering it, to achieve the perfect shape.

, This liquid fabric treatment can be obtained from craft or fabric stores; it will wash out when the embroidery work is completed. Only treat the area that will be embroidered–there is no need to treat the entire piece of fabric with the stabilizer. Use a paintbrush to apply, or a spray applicator and follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Once treated, leave the tulle to dry out of direct sunlight. Iron flat, as noted above.

, It is important to test the embroidery on the tulle before proceeding with the real project. This will give you a good idea of the quality, strength, etc., of the fabric and yarn, and will indicate to you whether more preparation of the cotton net tulle is required. If the fabric does not retain its stiffness across an entire test piece, you will need start preparing it again.

, Follow the instructions provided.
Allow to dry.
Cut close to the embroidery carefully. If treated with a non-fraying product, the stitches won't come undone if you accidentally nick it.

Fimo comes in 58g (2 ounces) and 350g (12.5 ounces) packages. It is the stiffest of the clays and the most difficult to condition.Fimo's firmness lets it hold very fine detail, and smearing is rare. This is important to consider if you plan on painting your rose after crafting it.
When fired, Fimo is very strong. It has a slightly glossy surface. It also buffs well and develops a high shine.
This brand of clay also comes in a beautiful selection of colors, including two transparent clays, six ""stone"" textured clays, a glow-in-the-dark clay, and metallic colored clay (""perglantz""). There is also a soft formulation of Fimo that comes in a different selection of colors.;
, This is another strong type of clay - ideal for making a rose - but is slowly becoming hard to acquire because it is being phased out by Premo Sculpey clay.


Promat is firmer than texture than Premo (its common substitute). It is harder to condition but less prone to smearing and stronger when fired. It is also flexible in thin sheets, which is optimal for when you craft the rose petals.

, Cernit is the strongest of the polymer clays.


Cernit has a porcelain, waxy finish when fired and is often used for doll-making because of its high quality when fired.
Though Cernit is the strongest of the clays, it is not as difficult to condition as Fimo. If you have delicate hands, choose Cernit over Fimo to go easy on your hands while still ensuring sturdiness.

, For a better finished product, choose one as close to the color red as possible.


If you're going for texture, Fimo and Cernit are your best options because of their refined finish after being fired. If you're going for color, Fimo has the wider range of colors and may produce the best contrast when crafting your rose.
Light pink is also a nice color. When you attach the calyx, or the green outer whorl of the flower, the contrast between colors will make your rose pop with contrast.

, This is known as conditioning, and it is necessary for making the clay ready to work with.


The physical process of stretching and compressing, combined with the warmth of your hands, changes the texture of the clay, making it softer and more pliable.It also makes the clay stickier and less brittle, which is ideal when making thin sheets for the petals.
Take a chunk of clay (about a half an ounce or so) and squish it between your fingers. As it warms and softens, roll it between your palms into a snake shape. Then move your hands against each other in a circular motion to compress the snake back into ball. Repeat this process several times until the clay is soft and easily molded.
For stubborn clay like Fimo, there are techniques for speeding up the conditioning process. Sit on the clay for 15-20 minutes to mildly warm it. Do not lay it in the sun or on a heating pad, as excessive heat will cause the clay to start curing, making it unusable. You can also use a food processor to chop the clay into smaller pieces to condition.

, Further divide this ball into seven even pieces, as these will be used to form your petals.The pieces should be about the same size, but they don't need to be exact. Having different sized petals will actually make your rose look realistic and natural.
For a 2 inch (5.1 cm) wide rose, roll your clay into a 1 inch (2.5 cm) ball.

, This will become your first rose petal.


Roll the clay ball first to make it as smooth as possible. You want few visible lines on the surface of your petal.
The size and shape of this petal should be similar to a standard guitar pick.
The point, which will become the base of the rose, should be thicker than the opposite edge, which will be the top of the petal. The top edge should be about 1/16 of an inch thick., Hold the petal with the thick point down and use the other hand to gently fold the sides in on themselves.


The edges of the rosebud should overlap a little.

, The top edge should also be slightly thinner.

, The petal should be facing the bud, not attached to the smooth back end.

, They should also be thinner than the second petal.

, This should offset it so that the three petals form a spiral when you look at the rose from above.


Gently roll the edge of the third petal outward, using the tip of your finger. The edge of the petal should curl downward a bit and should stick up a little past the second petal.

, Be sure to maintain the even, spiral design that you established in the previous step.


Also roll the edge of this petal outward, making sure that it sticks up past the third petal.

, These petals can be the same size as each other but should still be larger than the third and fourth.


The edges of these petals should be paper thin.

, Be sure to evenly distribute the petals so that it retains its symmetrical shape and spiral design.


Gently roll the top of the edge back after attaching each petal. For a wider, more ""bloomed"" flower look, curl the whole petal back. For a more bud-like look, curl just the very edge.

, This will help meld the petals together.


Hold the rose gently and use a knife or needle to cut off some of the base, making the bottom of the rose flat. This will make attaching the calyx easier.

, Set the oven temperature so that it is above 210 °F (99 °C) but below 300 °F (149 °C).


Heating causes chemical changes in the clay, making it hard and strong. Polymer clays, like the ones used for clay rose, don't require a special kiln and can harden normally in a standard kitchen oven.
The oven temperature must reach at least 210 °F (99 °C) for the polymer to fuse properly; however, if the temperature goes above 300 °F (149 °C), the clay may burn, giving off dangerous fumes.Most manufacturers recommend temperatures between 250 and 275 degrees Fahrenheit for all clays that are not translucent. If you are using translucent clay, keep the temperature between 210 and 220 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid changing its color, Let it cool so that you can safely and easily attach the calyx after molding it.

, This will become the calyx, or the leafy outer portion, of your clay rose.


The calyx should have 6-8 points and should be about 1/16th of an inch thick. Pinch the edges of each segment gently to make them thinner.

, Press it firmly to make sure there is good contact between the rose and calyx.


Don't worry if the calyx doesn't perfectly stick to the rose. Re-firing the rose with a fresh piece of clay will create a strong bond and secure the attachment.

, Use the same temperature and baking time as before.


Once your rose is completely done baking, let it cool for a few hours before applying paint or other decorations.

, You can re-fire clay as many times as you'd like, offering a wide variety of decoration opportunities for your clay rose.


Make a box out of strong clay and carefully attach several clay roses to the top. Attaching fired roses is ideal since joining two soft clay items can be difficult and can distort the shape. After you've successfully attached the items, fire it in the oven using the same temperature and bake time as the clay rose. Your box is now both practical and pleasant.

, Use a clay rose magnet to hold up a nice family photo or flaunt a stellar report card.


Simply attach a cluster of roses to a plain oval plate of clay. You can either join the two separately fired items using super glue, or you can use the fresh clay/fired clay re-fire method outlined above.

, Before you re-fire your clay rose, use a needle to make a hole in the calyx.


Hang the rose on a jump ring to make a clay rose earring. Run a necklace through the calyx hole and use the rose as a pendant. Or, you can put a hair clip through the calyx hole and use it as a fancy hair clip.

, Then pound down flatter, to spread it into a circle shape.

, Using your fingers, mold the flattened piece into a perfect circular shape.

, Use a small round object to cut out a hole from the center, in much the same way as cutting a cookie. Measure the object first to ensure there is plenty of wreath left.


Cutting objects could be made from a toothpaste tube lid, a drink bottle lid, a miniature round cookie cutter, etc. Whatever you use, make sure it is clean and won't transfer drink dye or sugary stickiness onto the clay.

, Shape a little bow from the clay or use a ribbon bow; whichever you find easiest or prefer. Use fresh clay to adhere the bow to the wreath.


Smooth the edges on the inner circle once you've removed the inner circle of clay. This will neaten the wreath.

, This will depend on the type of clay that you have used; follow the manufacturer's instructions.

If baking, do not add the ribbon bow until after the wreath is baked; it risks burning or curling up in the oven.

, Thread a ribbon or piece of yarn around what is the top of the clay wreath decoration and hang it on the tree. Alternatively, hang it on your dollhouse door.

Select fabric that has counted threads.,
Choose a fabric color that suits your needs.,
Pay careful attention to accurately counting the threads.,
Learn the stitches used for Hardanger.,
Prepare the fabric well.,
Plan ahead.,
Place a basting line on the exact spots where the Hardanger embroidery will be placed on clothing and cloth items.,
Use a needle without a point with a large eye.,
Get used to the feeling that you do not use knots in Hardanger embroidery.,
Practice on small pieces when beginning.",How to Prepare for Making Hardanger Lace," The warp and weft threads must be approximately the same (this means fabric with and even, symmetrical weave). Heavy linen with coarse regular weave is ideal because it ensures that you can count the threads easily., While traditional Hardanger embroidery is white worked on white, today's range of fabric colors and threads open up a wider possibility of color choices.

, Hardanger is not hard but it must be accurate. Counting the threads is the most important part of Hardanger embroidery. One mistake will ruin the pattern and make it necessary to start the work all over again.

, The stitches used in Hardanger are the Kloster blocks stitch (satin stitch) for solid sections of the designs and under-and-over woven bars (or wrapped bars) for the cut and drawn pieces.


The Kloster block stitches are arranged to outline the cut spaces - it is these stitches that construct the major parts of the design.Additional stitches that may be used include: eyelet, back stitch, lace stitch, and fagoting.

, Prior to mounting the fabric for a Hardanger project, given that the fabric may have a tendency to fray as you stitch it, overcast it first on all of its cut edges.

, Make your design on paper first. By necessity, Hardanger stitches will be geometric in shape, taking on the forms of squares, triangles, oblongs, diamonds, rectangles, etc.While the outer edges of the larger designs will appear very straightforward, it will be the smaller shapes developed around the larger ones that create the textual contrasts and provide the interest to your Hardanger piece.

, That way, the Hardanger decoration will be exactly in place.

, A pointed needle will split the threads and make accuracy impossible.

, Start a thread by placing a few stitches into the fabric and covering these with the embroidery stitches. Fasten off threads by running back on the underside of the fabric.

, Try making little Hardanger embroidery squares or diamonds on a sampler. This way, you will become familiar with the work of counting threads and mistakes will be easy to remedy.

, Keep pinching until it's closed, make sure there aren't any cracks. It has to be very smooth. Use the slip to smooth out cracks and to help close the back.

, On the flat side, pierce a hole right below the neck, but it must go into the cavity though. If you mess up and don't hit the cavity, press diagonally into the cavity. Clear the opening of the whole and make sure there isn't any excess clay in the cavity and the opening.

, Be sure to clear off the tool so there isn't any clay in the blow hole. Test out the whistle-if it works proceed, if it doesn't now it won't when it is done. So if it doesn't work adjust the neck a little bit, squeeze around, and make 100% sure there is no extra clay in any of the holes or the cavity. Make the neck a little bit bigger if necessary.

Purchase or find a suitable embroidery hoop.,
Wash your hands before handling the fabric.,
Pick up the embroidery hoop in its entirety.,
Place the embroidery fabric over the inner ring of the embroidery hoop.,
Press the outer ring down around the inner ring of the embroidery hoop.,
Tighten the screw on the embroidery hoop to secure the fabric in place.,
Finished.

",How to Mount Fabric in an Embroidery Hoop," The size of the hoop needed will be determined by the size of the project you're working on, as well as your capacity to hold the hoop on your lap or in your hands. The hoop shown in this image is a standard round size, but hoops can also be oval-shaped, and larger or smaller.;
, This ensures that dirt, chocolate, etc., stains are not accidentally transferred to the fabric as you feed it in. Also check that the hoop is clean - give it a wipe down if needed.

, Look for the screw join - the outer ring will usually have a metallic screw opening that can be tightened or loosened by turning the screw. Note that sometimes it is a plastic screw. Unscrew the metallic screw from the outer ring to loosen the bond between both hoops.


Once unscrewed, remove the hoops. Note that some hoops will be joined at the center and you will only be able to swing the middle hoop around to the center position rather than completely remove it; this is a design feature to prevent loss of the inner ring and it still works for feeding through the fabric, although it makes it a little trickier to maneuver it in. Just ease in across the fabric gently while holding the hoops wide open in the center position.

, Check that it is sitting evenly.

, There should be fabric overlapping around all sides. If there is not, you will need to adjust the fabric to ensure that the hoop is holding the fabric evenly across each side.


Once you have captured the embroidery fabric between both hoops, adjust the fabric neatness as you tighten the screw and the rings start closing in next to one another. The fabric shouldn't be puckered or loose, but should sit taut and smooth across the embroidering surface.

, Keep turning until it feels firm and in place. Don't overtighten as this will place pressure on the hoops (especially wooden ones). Note that you will most likely have to make tightening adjustments as you work on your project, especially longer projects. Traveling with hoops can cause the fabric to be shifted when weight, etc., is placed on the hoops.

Slowly fill in the outline.,
Remove excess stabilizer.",How to Machine Embroider," To create an even, tight design, you'll need to start with fabric that has no wrinkles or creases in it. Use an iron to rid the material of any wrinkles before you begin.

If the fabric is dusty or stained, you should also wash it before use. Wait until the fabric is completely dry before embroidering it.;
, Cut it out and move it around your material to visualize the best possible placement for your design.

Once you've found that placement, temporarily pin the paper template in place.

, Use a washable fabric pencil to mark the top, bottom, right, and left sides of the design on your fabric. Mark the center of the design, as well.

The center you mark should be centered in your embroidery hoop after you place it on.
To find the center of your design, fold it in half crosswise and lengthwise. The point of intersection should be your center point. Poke through it and mark the point on your fabric.
Remove the paper template after marking out its placement.

, Unless you're using a very heavy material, you'll need to apply a stabilizer to the back of the fabric before you embroider it. Choose a stabilizer based on the weight of the fabric and the design of your intended embroidery.

For most fabrics, a cut-away stabilizer is best when you want to create a solid embroidery design only viewable from the front of the material. This type of stabilizer is permanent.
When you want to create embroidery that can be viewed from the front and the back, use tear-away, wash-away, or heat sensitive stabilizer. All of these options can be removed at the end of the project.
Most stabilizer choices are suitable for linen and cotton, but for knit and interlock fabrics, cut-away stabilizers should almost always be used.
Mid-weight stabilizers work well enough for most fabrics. Delicate and stretchy fabrics might need heavy-weight removable stabilizers, while stiff materials might only need light-weight stabilizers.

, Stick the stabilizer onto the wrong side of your fabric.

Some stabilizers are self-adhesive. These do not need to be sprayed with a separate adhesive; simply stick the adhesive side of the stabilizer to the wrong side of the material.
Note that the piece of stabilizer you use should be slightly larger than the embroidery hoop you plan to use.

, Most fabrics don't need a topping layer, but you should use one when you select a fluffy, loose pile fabric.

Embroidery can sink into the fibers of the fabric when that fabric is fluffy. A topping helps to prevent that from happening.
Toppings are actually just wash-away stabilizers. Instead of placing it on the wrong side of the fabric, though, you should set it on top of the right side.

, Close the pieces together in between the two halves of an embroidery hoop. The stabilizer should be on the bottom, followed by the fabric, followed by the topping (when applicable).

Embroidery machines usually come with hoops designed for use with that machine.
If you are using a sewing machine instead of an embroidery machine, use a standard 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) circular or rectangular hoop.
Center all two or three layers over the outer hoop. Lay the inner loop on top and tighten it in place. If done properly, the design area should be centered in the hoop, taut, and smooth.

, You should also select an embroidery thread instead of all-purpose thread.

The needle needs to be big enough the carry the thread into the fabric without causing any damage. A size 70 or 80 needle is usually a good choice for most fabrics.
Use sharp embroidery needles for most fabrics, but switch to a ballpoint needle when working with stretchy knits.
The top thread should be embroidery thread, but you should wind the bobbin with all-purpose thread. Embroidery thread is heavier and more durable than all-purpose thread, making it ideal for the top design. All-purpose thread is used in the bobbin to reduce the overall weight, though.

, Turn the machine on and thread both the needle and the bobbin. As with a standard sewing machine, you'll need to draw the bobbin thread up through the bottom of the machine using your needle.

Some embroidery machines also double as sewing machines. In this case, you'll need to remove the sewing machine section and attach the embroidery arm.
Since each machine can differ, you should consult the instruction booklet to determine the proper way to thread yours.

, Many embroidery machines load designs via a separate computer. If yours is a machine like this, you'll need to attach the machine to your computer using a USB cord.

These machines also come with an installation disc. Place this disc into your computer and load the appropriate software before using your embroidery machine.
Other embroidery machines have a computer built into them. For these machines, all you need to do is turn the computer portion of the machine on. You should not need to load any software or connect to a computer.

, If you're using an embroidery hoop that came with the machine, there should be a way for you to snap the hoop in place.

Check the machine's instructions if you do not know how to do this.
The hoop will need to be loaded in so that the right side of the fabric faces up.
If you use an embroidery hoop that didn't come with the machine, it may not snap into place. In this case, you might need to hold the hoop down with separate clips or small clamps to prevent it from moving during the embroidering process.

, The exact procedure can vary greatly depending on manufacturer and model, so there is no single generic set of instructions to follow.

Sort through the built-in library of designs provided by the software. Usually, you can also add new designs to this library from files previously saved to your computer.
When embroidering letters, look through the different font options, as well.

, The start mechanism can vary based on make and model, too, but there's almost always one button labeled along the lines of ""start"" or ""send design."" Press this button and allow the machine to take things from there.

After you initiate the process, the machine will run on its own. You do not need to press on a power foot pedal or turn the material by hand as it works.

, After it creates approximately six stitches, press the ""pause"" button on your machine.

Carefully reach in with a pair of scissors and cut the tail of thread at the start of your design.
Doing this prevents the excess thread from getting tangled in the design as your machine works.

, Press this button again to continue the embroidering process. Allow the machine to run automatically without any further interruption.

Even though the process is automatic, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on your machine as it runs.
Watch for any warnings or messages the software may flash as the machine runs.
Note that the machine should stop on its own once it reaches the end of the design.

, When the machine finishes your design, switch it off and remove the material. Take a sharp pair of scissors and snip away any threads connecting separate parts of the design.

For instance, there will often be small threads connecting the letters of a name or word. You can cut these threads off without unraveling the rest of the work.
Take the fabric out of the embroidery hoop during this step, as well.

, If you used cut-away stabilizer, snip away any excess stabilizer from around the design using scissors. Leave the stabilizer stuck under the embroidered design in place.

Tear-away stabilizer can be gently ripped away from beneath the threads. Wash-away stabilizer dissolves in a washing machine. Heat sensitive stabilizer can be loosened and removed by running an iron over the embroidered area.
If done correctly, the completion of this step completes the process.

, Use a washable fabric pencil to lightly trace your design onto the right side of the fabric.

If you marked out the position of your design earlier using a paper template, use these marks to guide you as you draw out the design.
Note that it might be easier to sketch out the design before you hoop the fabric and stabilizer. After drawing the design, you should be able to hoop everything together as usual.

, Attach a special embroidery foot to the sewing machine. You'll also need to swap out the standard needle for something a little sharper than normal.

Follow the machine manufacturer's instructions regarding the proper way to change the presser foot and the needle.
A needle specifically designed for use with embroidery thread is ideal. Sharp embroidery needles work well with most materials, but a ballpoint embroidery needle might be best when you are working with a stretchy knit.

, The material needs to be free to move around, so you should lower the feed dogs beneath the needle until they no longer rise out of the machine.

Alternatively, you can place a metal plate over the feed dogs to prevent them from interfering with the fabric.
The process can vary from machine to machine, so consult the machine's instruction booklet for advice.

, Turn the machine on. Thread the machine as you usually would, but use embroidery thread instead of all-purpose thread for the needle.

Thread both the top needle and the bobbin. Use embroidery thread for the needle but standard, all-purpose thread for the bobbin.
Catch the bobbin thread with your needle and draw it up as you usually would.
If you need help threading your machine, consult the instruction manual that comes with it. Each machine can vary.

, Both settings should be switched to ""0.""

Regarding stitch style, you should select a standard straight stitch.

, Place the hooped fabric underneath the needle. Lower the presser foot onto the material using the machine's presser foot lever.

Note that the material should be right side up.

, Gently tap on the foot control pedal and begin stitching with your machine. Start at one place on your outline, and gradually move the hoop around with your hands under the needle, following the pencil line you drew.

Move the fabric very slowly and in small increments. The faster and further you move the fabric, the wider and looser the stitches will be. Ideally, you should aim to have small, tight stitches.

, Once the entire outline is done, reposition the fabric underneath your needle and begin filling the outline in.

As before, you should work slowly and in small increments to create tight stitches.
This can be a time-consuming process depending on the size of your design. The rows of thread need to be side-by-side, almost overlapping. If you get too sloppy, gaps will start to appear.
This step is only necessary if you have a solid fill embroidery design. You don't need to worry about it if your design is nothing more than light line-work.

, Remove the fabric from the machine and from its hoop. If you used cut-off stabilizer, take a pair of scissors and trim away any excess stabilizer from around the design.

If you used tear-away stabilizer, carefully rip it away from your stitches. Wash-away stabilizers can be removed by washing the project, and heat sensitive stabilizers can be removed by going over them with an iron.
After you remove the stabilizer, the project should be complete.

Plan ahead.,
Don't over-obligate yourself.,
Set a time to work on projects.,
Work on uncomplicated patterns.,
Make multiples of the same project.",How to Plan Needlework Projects in Advance," The best thing you can do to make the most of your time, is to plan ahead. Start in January thinking ahead to the projects you would like to create in the coming year. You can organize these ideas into a notebook divided with monthly tabs. Simply write down the project plans in each month. You may even want to include necessary materials and how long you think it will complete.;
, Be careful not to plan too many projects within a given time. It's best to choose only as many needlework projects as you can take on, without creating undue stress on yourself. Try to remember that many needlework projects require quite a bit of time to complete. Make the most of your time by choosing projects that aren't trendy, and will be timeless for years.

, When working on a deadline, such as a holiday, one of the best tips is to set a daily, or weekly time to work on your projects. You may also consider packing a smaller project in a tote bag. (one of the best times to work on smaller needlepoint projects is when you're waiting on an appointment.) Around the holidays, it might be fun to set this work time apart to spend with friends.

, Though there is a time and a place for more complicated, multi-colored patterns and projects, during the holiday rush may not be the best. You might be surprised by how much time can be saved just by choosing patterns and projects that don't require a lot of color changes.

, Perhaps one of the best time saving craft project tips is to make multiples of holiday gifts you will be giving. If you are making one Christmas ornament, could you go ahead and make several for others on your holiday list? Over the course of working the projects, you will find just the familiarity of the pattern and the process will save you time and frustration.

Gather your scissors, warp yarn, warping board.,
Tie the end of your warp yarn to the end peg on your warping board.

,
Place two pegs between the end peg and the first turn of the warping board.,Wind the first thread over one cross peg and under the second cross peg, then around the first corner peg until you have wound the first 3.5 length

,
Turn the yarn around the last peg and retrace your first warp thread/yarn back to the cross.,
Turn the yarn around the initial peg and repeat from step 4 until you have wound 257 threads.

,
Cut several pieces of contrasting yarn.,
To remove the warp from the board, put your hand into the loop at the last peg - the end of the warp - not the ""cross"" end.,
Place your warp on the front beam of the loom.

,

Pull the warp through the lease sticks to reach the back beams tie on apron.,
Once attached to the back beam, begin to wind the warp onto the back beam using your looms back beam advance.,
Continue to the end, leaving about one yard hanging through the loom towards the front beam.

,
Cut the ends of the warp leaving plenty of warp to thread through the loom onto the harnesses and heddles.,
Set your harness to thread a plain weave - begin to thread each ;warp thread through the heddles, beginning at harness one, next two, three, four.,
Insert an 8 dent reed in the beater.,
Tie your warp threads to the front beam apron in small groups of about 12 threads each.,
Check that you have no crossed threads by depressing the pedals and checking the warp- is it lifting all the threads in correct order?,
Find some scrap fabric or newspaper to use to weave off the first 12 inches (30.5 cm) or so of your warp.,
Wind your weft thread onto a bobbin and begin to weave, checking for even tension.,
Continue to weave until you have woven 72 inches (182.9 cm).

,
Cut the warp off the back beam and unwind the finished scarf from the front beam.

,
Lay the scarf on a table and tie the fringe in groups of 4 or more.",How to Handweave a Scarf," A warping board is available from Schacht Spindle or LeClerc. Your warp yarn is medium weight, about 1,200 yards (1,097.3 m) per pound, strong, not easily broken when you tug on it, but interesting for a scarf. You will be winding 96 warp threads that are 3.5 yards (3.2 m) long each for a 12 inch (30.5 cm) scarf. You will need 257 yards (235.0 m) for one scarf's warp.;
,, This is where your ""cross"" will be. The ""cross"" keeps your warp threads separated and aligned.

,, At the cross, if the first yarn is ""over the peg"" this one will go ""under the peg"" and the same alternating pattern for the next cross peg. You can see the ""cross"" take shape.

,, Before you remove the warp from the warping board you will tie the warp in several places to keep the threads form tangling. Tie the separated groups of thread in the ""cross"" area so that the ""cross"" remains intact.

, Grasp the yarn, place the loop from the peg onto the wound warp on the board, pulling it gently off the warping board as you work, and pull the warp through the loop continue to ""crochet"" the warp chain off the board until you reach the ""cross"" area. Voila, you have chained your warp!

,, You want one end untied. Put the lease sticks through your cross. This forms your cross that keeps your threads from tangling. Once you have placed the lease sticks in the cross, tie the lease sticks back together.

, Tie the warp on in small groups of about 12 threads each group. Space it evenly over the beam, so the warp is approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide on the back beam.

, Insert paper or lease sticks into the back beam warp as you wind it on. This keeps your warp aligned.

,, (at least 20 inches)

, Repeat to the end.

, Measure where your 12 inch (30.5 cm) scarf will be centered on the loom. Begin to thread each thread through each space in the reed until finished. If your warp is off-center, remove the threads and re-do the threading so your warp will be centered.

, Tension should be the same across the front beam.

, If not, re-do the section that is incorrect.

, This aligns the groups of warp threads and your warp will even out and be perfectly spaced. This part will be your fringe, as well.

, At every shot of the weft, be sure to maintain your selvages.

,,, Trim the fringe to a desirable length. Voila!

",How to Make Tassels1," You can make tassels out of just about anything, but this method works best with stringy materials, such as yarn or embroidery floss. You can also use other types of string, such as twine, cording, or very thin rope.;
, The longer your cardboard is, the longer your tassel will be. For a standard tassel, start with a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) piece of cardboard.You can always trim the tassel shorter when you are done if it is too long for you.

, This will make the string your tassel hangs from. You can use the same color as the rest of your tassel, or a contrasting color. The string should be at least 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) long.Remember, you can always cut it shorter at the end, if you need to.


Consider braiding three strings together first, and then taping them to the cardboard. This will not only make the handing string stronger, but also prettier., Make sure you are wrapping across/over the string you taped to the top of your cardboard. The more you wrap, the fuller your tassel will be. Plan on wrapping it at least 24 times., Don't cut it any higher, of your tassel will be uneven.

, This will help hold your tassel together.

, Your tassel is almost ready. Don't worry if a few strings fall out.

, You can match the color to your tassel, or use a contrasting color.

, Make the knot as tight as you can without breaking the string.

, Try to stay as close to the knot as possible.

, If you are worried about the knot coming loose, you can secure it with a drop of super glue.

, Your tassel may not be even along the bottom. If this happens to you, take a sharp part of scissors, and trim the tassel across the bottom until it is even.

If your leather/suede is very dark, try a light-colored pen or a white colored pencil.
Use a ruler to make your line as straight as possible.

, These will be the cutting lines for your fringe. The vertical lines should not go past the horizontal line.


Remember to use a ruler so that the lines will be as even as possible.

, Do not cut past the horizontal line, or your tassel will be uneven.

, The edge of the loop should be aligned with the narrow end of the rectangle. The bottom of the loop should be touching the horizontal guideline.

, Apply some glue every inch or so to help the tassel hold together. Also, try to roll it as tightly as possible. This will keep your tassel from being too bulky.

, Once you reach the end of the rectangle, draw a line of glue along the side, going from the horizontal guideline all the way up to the top. Do not get any glue on the fringe. Press the glued edge down firmly onto the tassel.

, You don't need to wrap anything around the fringe part, because there is no glue there. Once the glue dries, you can remove the rubber band.

Choose an easy pattern to begin with.,
Use even weave fabric.,
Check that the thread you intend to use fits the weave of the fabric.,
Choose the correct needle for undertaking blackwork embroidery.,
Tie a waste knot to start a new thread.,
Help wikiHow improve its articles on embroidery.",How to Get Started in Blackwork Embroidery," Blackwork is created using a ""stabbing motion"". This action takes the thread from front to back and back to front. It is absolutely essential to avoid gliding across the fabric.;
, When you first start blackwork embroidery, be sure to choose something simple for practice purposes. The first attempts will likely not provide the appearance you're wanting but keep trying.

, Blackwork must be exact and even; uneven fabrics will skew this and create an unbalance embroidery that doesn't provide a pleasing appearance.

, Do not use thread that is larger than the count of the fabric. If you try to do this, the larger holes will create a distortion, introducing undesirable unevenness to the design.

, The best needle is a blunt tapestry needle because it will be less likely to split the even weave threads. Note that the risk of splitting is a concern to be wary of as you undertake blackwork embroidery.

, A waste knot involves leaving a knot on the surface of the fabric, a short distance from the starting point of the embroidery.

, This article is merely about preparing for blackwork embroidery. wikiHow now needs lots more articles on the actual stitches involved in blackwork (with pictures where possible), as well as copyright free patterns. If you can help us to build up our needlework section, your help to build this volunteer-driven project will be greatly appreciated.

Bend one or two wires at the top of your design to make a loop.",How to Wire Wrap Stones," You might have found a beautiful piece of sea glass while walking the beach, or maybe you have a semi-precious stone that you think just breathtaking, but either can make a beautiful piece of wire wrap art.Symmetrical shapes can give your wire wrap a more professional look, but sometimes interesting shapes can further accentuate the centerpiece around which you will wrap your wire.


For the purposes of this example, a round, polished stone bead will be used. However, the principles of wire wrapping described can be applied to many differently shaped centerpieces.;
, Wire comes in many different varieties, both in terms of the material its made and its thickness, which is commonly referred to as the ""gauge"" of the wire. Larger and heavier centerpieces will require a thicker gauge of wire. All wire used in this example is either 20 or 22-gauge, which is frequently recommended for beginners.


The lower gauge your wire, the thicker it is. For example, 8-gauge wire is very thick, while 26-gauge wire is quite thin.You might consider using copper jewelry wire for your first wire wrap. Copper has a lovely color that compliments many different kinds of centerpiece, and is also relatively cheap.
Once you feel comfortable with your wire wrapping skills, you might use fine silver, sterling silver, gold plated, or gold filled jewelry wire., In this example of wire wrapping, a round, polished stone bead is used as the centerpiece and is wrapped in an inexpensive brass wire. Most of these supplies should be available at your local hardware or craft store, or even online. For this project, you'll need:


20-gauge square soft wire (4' (1.2 m))
22-gauge half-round hard wire (1' (30 cm))
22-gauge square hard wire (4½"" (11.5 cm))
A faceted stone
Eye protection
Felt-tip pen
Flat-nose pliers
Neck chain (or other fastener)
Penknife (or comparably thin knife)
Round-nose pliers
Ruler
Tape
Wire cutter

, You'll want to clear any obstacles that might get in your way and make working with your wire difficult. Clear a broad area; while you are trying to cut or bend a longer piece of wire, you don't want to accidentally knock something over with the loose end.


Consider making use of a work bench, craft table, or laying down a drop cloth where you are working. While shaping and cutting the metal wire, sharp pieces can fly or flake off. A drop cloth will make cleanup much easier.

, For centerpieces that are bulky or larger, you might need to measure out more wire. The central frame of your wire wrap should be:


Long enough to warp around the perimeter of your centerpiece.
Thick enough to hold your centerpiece. Heavy/bulky centerpieces might require you to use more than six piece of wire.

, Line up the wires and draw them tightly together, making sure each is parallel to the others. Then should use your tape to bind the ends. This will keep your bundle in shape while you work with the wire.


Depending on the contour of your centerpiece, you may find a rounded wire frame works best. In this example, the wire frame has been flattened to better contain the polished bead centerpiece.

, Now, with your felt-tip pen, you should mark this point.

, Use your wire cutters to snip free a five inch (13 cm) piece of 22-gauge half-round hard wire.

, Use your flat-nosed pliers to grasp the piece of 22-gauge wire you cut free, then bend the wire around the bundle. After each winding, pull the wire tight while holding it against your bundle with your free hand. The bundle should be wrapped so there are no gaps in its twinnings, and should be equal length on both sides of your middle mark.Grasping your wire close to its end with your pliers can make shaping it easier.
After you finish your bundling, your middle mark should not be visible.
This bundle will eventually make up the bottom of your wrap.
The width of the finished binding should be approximately ¼"" (6 mm) for a 12-carat stone, like the one used in this example., Then make another mark a ¼"" (6 mm) outward from each of your previous marks.


These double marks on either side of your middle binding define the width of your next bindings.

, Now that you've got your middle binding in place and your lines drawn on each piece your six-wire bundle, you can remove your tape, as it is no longer needed to keep your bundle collected together.

, Then, use your penknife to pry the topmost wire into the shape of an outward-pointing V. This V-shape should point away from the outer wires of your frame. Repeat this process until you have four Vs, one on each side of the top and bottom of your center binding.


Four V shaped twists on all sides of your center binding will create the sturdiest seating for your centerpiece. However, in this example, the polished stone bead is small and light, only requiring two V bends.
Each outer wire should have two V's on either side of the middle binding.
Each V begins at the edge of the binding, pointing out from the main bundle until the tip is in line with the first ¼"" (6 mm) mark. Then bend the wire to meet the second ¼"" (6 mm) mark.
After making your V bend seating, allow the remaining wire run parallel to the main bundle., This will ensure that your V bends stay on the outside of your bundle, which will create the most stable seating for your centerpiece. It will also keep your wire frame bundle together while doing the next bindings.

, Do this for both sides of your six-wire bundle.


While wrapping your second and third bindings, be sure you keep the wraps tight, neat, and equal in length. A few turns on either side should be sufficient.

, Let both side of your six-wire bundle cross at the center-top of the stone.

, Bend one of the outermost strands of your six-wire bundle from either side with flat-nose pliers. Shape the wire so that it sticks upward and away from the rest of the wires., Where both sides of your wire frame meet at the top of your design, align all strands so each faces the opposite direction of your first middle binding. The middle binding will form the bottom of your design, and the combined ends of your six-wire bundle will form the top.

, This will prevent your wires from becoming bent out of the intended shape of your design when making your final binding. Tape toward the end of your combined six-wire bundle.

, A few wraps of 22-gauge square hard wire at the top should do.


Once you have finishing this binding, you may remove the tape.

, Use pliers to bend the front and back Vs so as to form a secure seating in which the centerpiece sits. Once the centerpiece is in its cradle, take the final wire that has been pointing away from the bundle and wrap it around your centerpiece in a spiral design to further secure it.


The spiral design of your wire wrap will give a professional appearance to your jewelry.
If you notice your centerpiece is loose in its V and front settings, you may want to take another piece from your bundle and add another spiral wrap to the back for support.
Consider adding wavy designs, or spirals at the top of your wire wrap where you have extra wire to add your personal touch.

, Keep in mind while trimming excess wire that you'll need enough leftover at the top to make a loop of wire. You'll need this loop to thread a neck chain or some other kind of fastener, like a thin strip of leather., This O-shape will form the eyelet through which you will thread your neck fastener. Depending on the gauge of wire you have used, you may want to from your fastener eyelet with either one wire or two."

Opt for silver if you want your locket to withstand wear and tear without paying the price for gold. Alternative metals that are popular include cobalt, tungsten carbide, ceramic, stainless steel and titanium.If you have cool skin tones, your ideal metals are light or white. For example, platinum, white gold and silver.
If you have warm skin tones, you’ll look best in yellow gold, rose gold, copper or brass.
People with neutral skin tones can wear any shade of metal.;
, If you have a cool skin tone, look for gemstones in cool tones like red, blue and purple. If you have a warm skin tone, try yellow, green or orange gemstones. You may want to wear your birthstone or the birthstones of loved ones.Examples of gemstones for cool skin tones are ruby, amethyst, sapphire and aquamarine.Examples of gemstones for warm skin tones are citrine, emerald and peridot.

, Some of the available shapes are round, heart-shaped, oval and square. Choose a heart-shaped locket for a romantic vibe, or to give to a partner as a gift.A round or oval locket is versatile and makes a good gift for someone who is not your romantic partner.For example, you may want to give a heart-shaped locket as a gift for an anniversary or Valentine’s Day.

, Get a locket in a standard shape with minimal ornamentation for a piece to wear with many outfits. Alternately, go for a unique locket to wear as a statement piece.


A simple locket is often round or oval, and may be plain on the face or have a lightly discernible etched pattern.
Look for lockets in unique shapes like an oyster, or with an interesting detail – for example, a butterfly perched on a heart locket., Choose a chain that allows the locket to sit at your collarbone, by your heart, or just below your bustline. Alternately, choose a long slide chain if you want the locket to sit near your naval. Opt for thin chains if your locket is dainty and formal. Wear a thin or chunky chain for a casual vibe.Wrap or double-wrap a slider chain to change the length of your necklace.Try different chains with the same locket for different ways to wear the same pendant., Choose an image to display in your locket. Press a piece of tracing paper into the recess of your locket. Trace around it with a pencil to get the shape you’ll need to cut your photo down to.Use an image of one of your loved ones to fit into your locket. For example, you may want to frame a small photo of a family member, spouse or pet in your locket. Other options are an image of a religious icon, or a Victorian picture for a vintage feel.If you’re printing out an image, opt for a grayscale print on regular paper. Photo paper absorbs less ink and can fade more easily.

, Choose a small memento, such as a lock of hair, bit of ribbon, or a dried flower petal. Or take a small square of fabric, dip it in perfume or scented oil, and close it in your locket.Think outside the box! If your locket opens and closes, you can put a little souvenir in it that has meaning only to you. For instance, a small piece of a ticket stub.

, Take your locket to a jeweler or engraver to get custom text written on your locket. Choose words or letters that are meaningful to you. These can be initials, a name, a date, or a phrase.For example, you may want to engrave a few song lyrics, a Bible verse, or a short literary quote.
If your locket isn’t an engravable metal or you want a more temporary option, print the words on paper and display them inside your locket instead.

, Wear black or solid color top to give the most focus to your locket. Avoid layering on other necklaces or pendants. Keep your locket clean so it can shine its best.A top with a high collar helps showcase the locket entirely over the fabric you’re wearing. Alternately, if your locket falls at the collarbone, you can choose to wear a top with a neckline that cuts just below the locket.
Try wearing a lace blouse to compliment the vintage feel.

, If you wear other jewelry, try to keep the metal or shade consistent with that of your locket. Keep earrings minimal so as not to distract from your locket. Try bracelets with charms to mimic the dangle of your locket pendant.


For example, you may want to wear simple hoops or stud earrings.

, Wear a locket with any casual outfit – such as jeans, a tank top, and a loose cardigan. Don a simple sweater for casual or business casual attire, to give your locket all the attention. Wear a short chain if your top’s neckline is below your collarbone and a long chain if your neckline is at or above your collarbone.


For example, pair a locket on a short chain with a scoop-neck tee.
Wear your locket on a long chain with a v-neck tee and a cool jacket. The locket dangling on a long chain will make the chain mimic the “v” neckline of the top.
Try wearing a locket on a long chain over a sweater or casual dress.

, Wear delicate, fine jewelry lockets with business attire, formal wear or even bridal wear. Choose a loose top with butterfly sleeves or a fitted top over a skirt or trousers. Pair a locket with any dress, as long as the neckline allows the locket to properly show. If that’s an issue, wear your locket with a different chain.


For example, dress in a black fitted top and a voluminous white skirt. Choose a top with a boat neckline and wear your locket over the shirt.
Wear your locket around your neck or attached to a bridal bouquet to incorporate it into your wedding."

Match your flowers to your outfit.",How to Securely Place a Flower in Your Hair," Think about how often you want to wear flowers in your hair and how long you want them to last. Using fake flowers is nice because you can reuse them and they are sturdy.Real flowers are more authentic and have a nice smell., Do you want just one flower or a lot of flowers? A single flower is cute and subtle, whereas a lot of flowers are fun and eccentric. Figuring out how many flowers you want is going to help you determine what flowers you choose.

, You can choose whatever fake flower catches your eye, but if you want a more traditional flower look, choose fake flowers that look real. Pick flowers that don’t have rhinestones, glitter, or unnatural flower colors if you want them to look like real flowers., You want flowers with strong stems and petals that are not going to wilt. Good flowers to choose are orchards and gardenias. They will stay in your hair better and not look sad and dead part way through the day., If you opted for real flowers, chill them before you wear them. It sounds unimportant, but chilling your flowers will make them fresher and crisper when you wear them. The night before, place cut flowers in water and refrigerate them overnight., You want the stem of your flower to be about two inches long. This will give it enough length to secure it but not be too long where it will be noticeable. If you have short, thin, or fine hair paint the stem of the flower. Use a color similar to your hair color. This way if the stem shows through it won’t be noticeable. You can use paint or even nail polish to do this., You can remove the stem entirely off of a fake flower and replace it with a bobby pin. Cut the stem off, but not the plastic that connects it to the petals. Take a wide, sharp needle and thread that is a close color to the petals. Stich the thread through the plastic, the round end of the bobby pin, and back through the plastic. Tie the thread so the bobby pin stays secure., You can cut the stem (of real or fake flowers) to be three centimeters or smaller and slide the stem through the bobby pin. The end of your pin should reach around a millimeter away from the flower itself. You can then pin the bobby pin in your hair to secure it.

, Bobby pins go into your hair with the bumpy side down and the flat side up.For extra support, you can stick another bobby pin across the one connected to the flower to make an “X” shape.

, You can stick the flower with the stem attached to it into your pony tail. Tuck the stem into the hair tie to keep it secure in your hair.You can do this with a ponytail, bun, braid, or half pony tail.

, When your hair is down, the flowers look best tucked near your ears.If the flowers are too low, they might look too random in your hair.
If the flowers are very high on your head, they will be too noticeable., A flower next to each ear will probably not look as good as a flower or two next to one ear. If you put the flower in your ponytail, bun, or updo, don’t put it directly in the center or top. You should place the flower slightly off center or to the side., This is a hairstyle where your hair is up and off of your neck and shoulders in an elegant way. You can make an updo even better by sticking the stems of flowers directly into the updo or securing them with bobby pins.There are many types of bun, twisted, and braided updos that you can try., Wear flowers that match the look you are trying to achieve. Many flowers or a flower crown look great for festival and bohemian styles and a few subtle flowers look best with simple and elegant outfits.


Get clothing with fringe, feathers, and bold geometric or floral patterns for a bohemian or festival style outfit.Wear your hair down or in braids.
If you want something more elegant, pair you subtle flowers with simple prints, formal dresses, and delicate fabric. Wear your hair down and styled or in an updo for this style."

Finished.

",How to Make an Inverted Fishtail Bracelet from Rainbow Loom," Pick two pegs to use. Place one rubber band across two hooks, twisted once to make it a figure 8. Push that towards the bottom of the pegs, and place two more rubber bands on top without twisting them.;
, Use your hook to grab one end of the bottom band and pull it over the top of the peg, so that it's looped over the other two bands. Do the same with the other side of the bottom band. Then put a new rubber band on the pegs, again without the twist, so that there are three rubber bands total on the pegs. Twist one band into an infinity shape.

, Use the hook to bring both ends of the bottom rubber band over the top of the peg and the two other bands on it. Then add another band to the peg so that you finish each step with three bands on the pegs.


To make an ordinary fishtail bracelet, you would simply continue this step until the bracelet was long enough. For the inverted fishtail, this step is just to make sure all the rubber bands are secure before you begin the trickier inverted pattern.

, You should have three bands on the pegs. On one side, slide your hook in between the top two and use it to pull the middle one backwards, away from the pegs and out of the way. With the middle band still pulled back, use your hook to grab the bottom band. Pull the bottom band up through the middle band and then over the top of the top band. Pull it off the peg and leave it sitting on top of the bands stretched between the pegs.

, Then make sure to add another band on top, so that you always finish the stitch with three bands.


This stitch is very similar to the regular fishtail. The only difference is that the bottom band comes up inside the middle band and then outside and over the top band, rather than going outside and over both of them.

, Use your hook to pull the middle band out of the way. Reach inside and grab the bottom band, then pull it over the peg. Do this on the other side, and then add another rubber band on top.

, Depending on the size of your wrist, this can take more than 40 rubber bands.

, Finish the way you started, with two regular fishtail stitches. To do this, simply pull the bottom band over the peg on both sides. Add another band and repeat with the new bottom band. You should have two bands left on the pegs.

, The two bands that were left on the pegs won't be connected to anything. Holding the ends of the last band that you wove, slide the two loose bands out of the bracelet.

, Slide the two looped ends of the last band you wove onto one end of the C/S clip. The other end of the bracelet will have two crossed loops from the first band that you wove; slide these loops onto the other end of the C/S clip to secure your bracelet.

Cut a square out of your material.,
Lay the square flat out in front of you.,
Repeat with the other two corners.

,
Flip the square over so the folds are touching your work surface.,
Tie the spare strip of material around the middle of your Bow, so it keeps its shape.,
On the back of the bow, gently glue down all of the loose, flappy bits of the sides.,
When the glue has dried/cooled down, take your needle and cotton and sew a few loops into the centre of the bow, make sure they're quite loose, and when you pull the cotton, the loops get tighter.

,
Slide the smooth half of the bobby pin into the cotton loops, then pull the cotton tight so the bobby pin is secured.,
Then ta-da!,
Finished.

",How to Make Your Own Bows," It doesn't have to be exact. Cut a strip out of the rest of your material, make it about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) wide and slightly longer than your square.;
, Fold the top two corners into the middle, like your making a paper plane.

,, Carefully, start gathering the material together in the middle. It should start looking like a bow by now.

, You might have to fiddle around with it, so each side is roughly even.

, If you need to, fasten the tie to the bow too.

,, If you need to, add a few more loops.

Are you planning on wearing a red outfit? Make a predominantly red bracelet. Maybe you don't want to match at all. You are versatile and unique, so why not make your bracelets the same?


Many websites sell multiple different colors, from monochrome bands to multicolored, tie-dye, and glow in the dark. Mix and match to your heart's content.;
, To make the most basic bracelets, you will only need rubber loom bands, a loom, and a metal hook tool to attach them together. However, the quality and style of these products differ wildly. Browse at a few sites to see which ones you like the most.









You can buy silicon, jelly, latex-free, and other types of loom bands. If you are allergic to latex, the type of band you buy is incredibly important to avoid allergic reactions. Make sure you get the correct looms for your project, and your health.
C-hooks are necessary to make bracelets that are easily removable. You will attach these to the end of your loom bracelet when you have finished attaching all the loops. It will attach to the other end of the bracelet, and permit you to put on and remove the bracelet at will. These also come in many different colors.
Making loom bracelets is possible without a loom, but it is more difficult to do. As these are relatively cheap, it is definitely a good investment to buy one, especially if you are planning to make many loom bracelets.
It is also possible to work without a hook tool, by using your finger or a common household item, like a pen or a screwdriver. Metal hook tools are also cheap, though, and the long hooked apparatus is very useful for getting in the small spaces in and around a loom to hook the rubber band loops. It is best to invest in one of these, if you plan to make many bracelets, as it reduces the time and hassle of your work.

, You will need a clean, well-lit, and flat area to do the most productive work on your future bracelets.


Try to pick an open area to work in, such as a clean kitchen table or a large desk. Working on the couch may be more comfortable, but if you drop your looms, you'll have to dig through the cushions to find them again. If you drop them on a table, they're still right there in front of you.
Working at a large, open space is also enticing to other people, who may want to join you. If you enjoy group projects, this is a great way to get your friends or family involved. If not, then pick a smaller space.

, Take your loops, your loom, and your metal hook tool and set them on your working area, such as a desk or a table.

,









Your loom should be facing away from you, and the direction of your bracelet making should run away from you, up the loom.

,









If you are making a multi-colored bracelet, make sure you alternate the colors here. If you have red and white, for the first infinity loop, place two reds, then for the second regular loop two whites, and for the third regular loop, another two reds.

, Placing it underneath the right loops of the infinity loop, wrap it over the right rung and on top of all three loops.








, Now, both loops should be wrapped around the upper two, regular loops.









Press down on all three loops so that they sink to the bottom of the two rungs, lest they spring off and ruin your work!

,,, Continually repeating step 7 will pull the fishtail out and increase its length.









Be mindful of your wrist size when you are doing this, as the circumference of your wrist will determine the size of your bracelet.

, Take your thumb and your index finger and wrap them around the loops of the bracelet still attached to the loom. Carefully edge it upwards until it is fully removed.









Make sure the bracelet is the correct size for your wrist, or the wrist of the person you are making it for, before removing it. It will be difficult to resize once you've finished making it.

, Be careful not to remove the integral bands, though, which are necessary for the bracelet's structure.








, Bringing the two heads of the remaining open loops together, insert your index finger through the space and then enlarge the opening. Insert the C-hook here.








, Huzzah! You're finished!








, Take your loops, your loom, and your metal hook tool and set them on your working area, such as a desk or a table.


You can use either staggered or even position for your loom, but even position is superior. Take the middle row of the loom and place it in the center, so that it is equidistant from the other two rows.
Remember that you are placing loops from right to left.

, Starting from the second-to-last rung on the first row, place this on the last rung of the middle row, on the rightmost edge.








, One rung should be the middle row rung that the diagonal loop is also on, so start from the edge of the loom and move one rung out.








, Starting from the last rung of the middle row, place it on the second to last rung of the third row.








, Do this starting from the second-to-last rungs of each row, so that they are on top of one of the rungs of the first three loops and ending on the third-to-last rungs of each row.









This is a good time to introduce a second color, if you are planning to use one.

, Starting from the third-to-last rung of each row, place one loop horizontally on the fourth-to-last rung, so that the first half of loop is on top of the previous loop, and the second half is on a new rung.









This is a good time to introduce a third color, if you are planning to use one.

, Make sure you continue introducing new colors as you desire, as well as alternating the colors to form a pattern.









Do not place any loops on the very last rungs of the loom.

, You should form a mirror image of the first, diagonally placed loops.









Ideally, you will have alternated all your colors in a certain pattern, so that the color at the beginning is identical to the color at the end.
You could also form a wave pattern with the colors. It is up to you how to pattern your loop bracelet.

,, Starting from the second-to-last rungs on the right side, move down the loom until you have reached the second-to-last rungs on the left side.









You can use whatever colors you want, or you can use a single color to add a uniform layer on top of the pattern you have created.

, The right side will now be the left, and the left the right. The single, doubled loop that you placed at the end will now be closest to you.








,,









This will form a teardrop shape between the second-to-last rung on the first row, and the last rung on the middle row.

,









Like with the first looping back, you will have to reach underneath the top band with your metal loop tool to reach the bottom band, which you will then loop over itself onto the next rung moving leftwards.
The loop of the second-to-last rung of the first row to the left will be looped diagonally onto the last rung of the middle row to the left.

,









The teardrop shape will be indicative that you are doing it correctly while looping the bands of the middle row back on themselves.

,









The first loop should move from the middle row to the third row diagonally, then horizontally, as in steps 12 through 15.
The teardrop shape will be indicative that you are doing it correctly while looping the bands of the middle row back on themselves.

,,, Then, move the bands backwards onto the thick part of the tool above the hook.








, Slowly and carefully pulling upward with the hook tool, take the bracelet off the loom.









Avoid pulling too hard, as this may stretch your bracelet or even break some of the loops.
Make sure to leave your hook tool attached to the loop at the end, as it will be necessary later.

, Your bracelet will probably be too small for your wrist, so estimate the number of loops you will need and begin extending the bracelet. You can do this by putting loops horizontally on the rungs going left, doubling up on each end.









For a smaller wrist, such as that of a child's an additional six bands will be sufficient. If your wrist is larger, add as many as necessary.
You can continue using one color, or you can add multiple colors, depending on whether you want to continue with the pattern or just extend the size of the bracelet.

, Stretching out the final loop of the bracelet, simply attach it on top of the final rung of the new loop row.








,, This is just like when you were making the main body of the bracelet.









Move all the way down the loom to the end.
You know you've done it right when the loops make a teardrop shape.

, Stretching the final loop to the vertical rung directly above it to make room, attach a C-hook to the end of the loop facing outwards.








,, You're done!

Get your materials together.,
Start stringing your loom bands as you would in a fishtail loom.,
Put an 'S' clip on the figure of 8 band.,
Take a third loom band and place it on your middle finger and index finger.,
Repeat until you reach the end of the bracelet and it is long enough to go around your wrist.,
At the end, put a last band on but don't put a bead on.",How to Make Loom Bands with Beads," You will need:


Loom bands- it's easiest to use one colour at first.
Beads- if you have a bead kit it's perfect, but you just need some beads with a hole big enough to fit a piece of string through.
String- coloured is best, the best is the string you get in a bead kit. Make sure that it is long enough to fit around your wrist.
Your fingers.;
, Start by putting one band in a figure of 8 position on your middle finger and index finger. Then put another band normally on your middle finger and index finger above the first band.

, Then take your string, thread it through the second band and tie it on to the figure of 8 band.


Next, hook the figure of 8 band on to the second band, like you would in a fishtail band.

, Thread the string through the middle of this band. Then take a bead and slide it to the bottom of the string.


Take the second band and hook it on to the third band. Don't worry if the bead pops out- you can rectify this at the end.

, Remember, put each band on your middle finger and your index finger, thread the string through, slide the bead on the string, hook the band onto the bead, then put another band on your fingers. Continue doing this to the end.


Remember, don't let go of the string when a bead is on it or the bead will slide off of the end.
Get plenty of bands and beads- you don't want to run out halfway through.

, Then hook the end to the 'S' clip. Poke the beads that have popped out into the bands if you want, but it looks good either way. Cut the loose end off the string. Your loom band with beads is now finished.

Take the center color of paracord, lay it across the top, but under the flatline piece.,
Continue the same pattern weaving the flatline over under every knot, until you get to the end.,
Cut off the ends of the paracord as close to the bracelet as possible, and melt them with a lighter.





",How to Flatline Paracord Bracelet," You will need about 10 feet of 550 paracord, and another piece of paracord that you will use as your flatline. You will also need a paracord buckle, some scissors, and a lighter.;
, Then take the center strings out of the flatline piece on paracord and feed it through the buckle 2 inches.

, Then with the second piece of paracord, wrap it around the first, go behind the back, up through the hole made by the first, and pull it tight. Make sure you tuck the flatline tail piece into the back so you braid over it.

, The take the second piece of paracord, wrap it over the first, behind the bracelet and up through the hole made by the first. and pull tight.

Gather your materials.,
Twist one band into a figure ""8"" and fold it over so it forms a circle.,
Pinch one band between your fingers.,
Pinch another band and slide it through the loops formed by band #2.,
Repeat the pinch and slide until bracelet is long enough.",How to Make Loom Bands1," Count out the number of bands you'll need for your bracelet. You will probably need around 20 for a child's bracelet and around 30 for an adult's bracelet. You will also need one C-clip, which you can usually find in the same craft store aisle as the loom bands.


Sometimes the clips will be included when you purchase the loom bands. Double-check to make sure you have everything you need.
You can make a striped bracelet by alternating between two colors, or a fun rainbow pattern by using a mix of colors.;
, Slide this circle inside the C-clip. This is the beginning of your bracelet. We'll call this band #1.

, Slide this band (#2) halfway through the circle you made in Step 2. Pull the ends up and hold them together.

, Make sure you keep holding the ends of band #2 together while you do this or the chain will come undone! Now band #2 is securely part of the chain, and band #3 looks just like band #2 in the previous step.

, Slip one loop of the final band through the other loop and pull tightly. Slide the last band's remaining loop into the C-clip from Step 2


If you aren't sure whether your bracelet is long enough, wrap it around your other wrist. Make sure it's not too tight! Wearing a bracelet that's too tight might disturb blood circulation or cause swelling."
"
Gather your materials.,
Wrap one loom band around your index and middle fingers.,
Wrap two more loom bands around your index and middle fingers.,
Pull the bottom loom band on your middle finger over the top band.,
Slide the band that is now in the middle into the clip.,
Wrap another loom band around your fingers.,
Slide the last band into the other side of the plastic clip.",How to Make Loom Bands2," Count out the number of bands you'll need for your bracelet. This bracelet is a little thicker than the basic bracelet, so you'll probably need around 30 bands for a child's bracelet and around 40 for an adult's bracelet. You will also need one C-clip or S-clip.


If you don't want to work on your fingers, you can use unsharpened pencils, knitting needles, or even chopsticks to hold the bands.The process is the same no matter what you use.Just hold the pencils in your non-dominant hand and work with your dominant hand.
Using two (or more!) colors of bands will bring out the fishtail design better than using only one.

, Twist it in the middle to form an ""infinity"" or ""8"" shape. Be careful not to stretch the bands too much. They might snap if overstretched.

, Don't twist these bands; just place them on top of the first one. You won't twist any more of the bands from here on out.


If you're using two or more colors, make sure to alternate the colors of the bands as you wrap them.

, Bring it to the middle of the bands (halfway between your fingers) and release. Next, pull the bottom loom band on your index finger over the top band. Bring it to the middle and release.

, This will help keep your bracelet from coming undone as you work.

, Repeat Step 4. Keep adding bands and repeating Step 4 until you have made the size you want.

, This will complete the loop. Now you have a beautiful fishtail bracelet!


You can modify this method to make a ring or a necklace -- just weave fewer or more bands until it's the length you want and then connect the ends with the plastic clip.

Pull the bottom three bands (group #2) over the tip of the left pencil to the middle.,
Repeat Steps 3 and 4.,
Slide the plastic clip into the bottom end of the bracelet (where you started).,
Wrap one loop around your non-dominant thumb.,
Attach the remaining loop to the clip.",How to Make Loom Bands3," You will need loom bands in 3 different colors, a C-clip or S-clip, and two pencils (or chopsticks or knitting needles). This bracelet is a lot chunkier than the previous two, so you will need between 40 and 50 bands for a child's bracelet and around 70 bands for an adult's bracelet. Use as many as you need.

, Use the same color for all three bands here. This is different from the fishtail bracelet above because you'll twist all three bands rather than just one. We'll call these group #1.

, Don't twist these bands. Just loop them around the pencils. We'll call these group #2.

, Then repeat for the right pencil. The first three bands (group #1) should now be looped around the middle of the second three bands (group #2).

, This is just like Step 3: don't twist these bands, merely wrap them around the pencils. We'll call these group #3.

, Then repeat for the right pencil. The group #2 bands should now be looped around the middle of the group #3 bands.

, Remember to alternate your colors. Just keep wrapping groups of three bands around the pencils and bringing the bottom bands up over the pencils to the middle. Continue until the bracelet is as long as you want it.

, At the top of the bracelet the last group of bands will form two ""loops."" Pinch these together and carefully slip the loops off the pencils.


Take your time with this step. Pulling too quickly could cause the bracelet to come undone!

, Using your dominant hand, pull the other loop to stretch the bands apart slightly. Then slide that loop through the other loop. You should now have a slipknot at the end of the bracelet.


Make sure to slip all three bands through the loop!

, This will complete the circle and your bracelet will be ready to wear!

Repeat Step 2.,
Repeat Steps 2-5.,
Attach one end of the plastic clip to the loops at the end of the bracelet.,
Slide all four loops off the fork.",How to Make Loom Bands4," You will need assorted loom bands in at least two colors, a plastic S-clip, a dinner fork (with four tines), and a pencil or chopstick. (Anything long, skinny, and slightly pointed will work.) This pattern is more complicated than the others, so take your time!

, The fork should be facing you. Pull the band back a little, twist it, and slide it over the second tine. Continue pulling, twisting, and looping over the remaining two tines. The band should make what looks like two ""8""s on the fork.

, You can use a different color or the same, depending on how thick you want the stripes in the pattern to be.

, Pull it up and over the fork tine to the back. It should come over and across the top band and form a loop at the back of the fork.

, Pull it up and over the fork tine to the back. Repeat with the final two loops.

, You should have a row of what looks like ""8""s on the fork again. Repeat Steps 4 and 5, using the pencil to pull the bottom band from the front up and over the fork to the back.

, Continue in the pattern, alternating between forming rows of ""8"" loops and pulling the bottom band over the fork tines. Create as many rows as necessary to make the bracelet your desired length.


Once you've gotten several rows finished, give the back of the bracelet a little pull. This will help keep the pattern tight and in place.

, When you pull the bracelet (which should be behind the fork), you should see two open loops where you began weaving. Slide one end of the S-clip through both loops.

, Make sure to pinch them at the bottom as you slide up so you don't lose them! Slip all four loops through the other end of the S-clip. Now your hexafish bracelet is finished!


Take your time with this step. If you slide the loops off too quickly, it could unravel the bracelet.

Get your supplies.,
Take your measurements.,
Prepare your fabric.,
Create darts at the corners.,
Sew in the zipper.,
Sew the remaining sides.",How to Make Cushions," For the most basic cushion, you’ll need fabric, a foam pad (or pre-existing cushion), cotton batting, a zipper, sewing machine, and matching thread. Pretty simple, right? You’ll also need a few basic tools, including scissors, a measuring tape, a ruler, an iron, and straight pins.


Be sure to choose a sturdy upholstery fabric; cushions suffer a lot use and damage, meaning that not just any fabric will hold up.
If you’re not reupholstering a cushion you already have, choose a sturdy, heavy-weight cushion that is comfortable for sitting (not just what’s on sale). Your bum will appreciate the extra few dollars.;
, If you’re reupholstering a pre-existing cushion, start by removing the cover and cutting the seams. Measure the original piece of fabric, and get the same amount of your new fabric to reupholster it. You’ll need two pieces of fabric: the top piece (just the length by the width) and the bottom piece (the length, width, and depth - or sides -). If you’re making a cushion from scratch, you’ll need three basic measurements: the length, the width, and the depth.


To find the length, measure the longest side and add 1 extra inch.
To find the width, measure the shorter side and add 1 extra inch.
To find the depth, measure the height, double this measurement, and add 1 inch (2.5 cm). For example, if the height is 4-inches, double this to get 8-inches, and add 1 additional inch for a total of 9-inches.

, If you’ve bought brand new fabric that is not pre-washed, you should wash your fabric (according to package instructions) to prevent it from shrinking later on. Lay your fabric out flat, and cut it to size according to your measurements. If necessary, use your iron to remove any wrinkles that might exist.

, Place your cushion/foam in the center of your fabric with the pattern side of the fabric facing down/out, and use a pencil to outline it. Take the fabric at the corners, and fold it diagonally to create a mitered corner. Use your sewing machine to stitch in 1-inch along the diagonal fold, perpendicular to the edge of the fabric. When the corners are finished, cut the excess diagonal strip of fabric off within ½ inch of the new seam.

, The zipper is sewn in first, prior to stitching closed the sides of the cushion. Pin your two pieces of fabric together in the center of each side, lining up the fabric so that the print-sides are facing each other. On the side you’re going to sew the zipper, measure outwards from the center (where the pin is). Sew a seam along the whole edge, from corner to corner using a ½ inch seam allowance and a basting stitch. Repeat this for both sides. Place the zipper between the two sides, pin it in place, and sew along the fabric band attached to the zipper.Make sure your zipper is centered before you pin or sew it.

, Work along the rest of your fabric, pinning the sides together (with the fabric inside-out still). Sew along each of the seam sides with a ½-inch seam allowance. When you reach a corner, pivot the fabric on the sewing machine so that you may continue stitching without moving your fabric. Use a reverse stitch at the end to secure your final stitching in place.


Finish your cushion. Turn your cushion cover inside-out with the zipper left unzipped. Cut your batting to size, and wrap it around the foam cushion. Insert the foam cushion through the open zipper hole, and position it to fit inside the cover. Adjust the cover accordingly, and your project is finished!"

Install the wall-mounted side drape rod according to the instructions provided.,
Gently push the rod into the slider pocket sewn earlier.,
Use.",How to Make a Mosquito Net1," If you've purchased the netting from a craft or fabric store, it'll probably be jagged on the side that was cut in the store. Trim this edge using a square rule, yardstick or table edge.
,

Fold down the edge 5mm (0.19"") on one side and stitch all the way along.
Repeat for each edge of the netting, until you've stitched a hem on all of the netting.
Fold again and stitch the new fold to cover raw edges. This final stitch around will also give a clean and sturdy line.

,

Fold the hemmed net in half. Do this lengthways.
Pin this fold down 6cm (2.3"").
Sew across the top down 2cm (1-ish inch), then sew a row 6cm (2.3"") down.

, It can be any height you consider appropriate but if you're looking for guidance, around 2 metres (2.1 yards) from the floor is good.

Be sure to check for wall studs before mounting the rod. If not, use a bolt or toggle to assist.

, Gather as you push, until the whole mosquito net fits properly. To keep firmly in place, finish by pushing an acorn end onto the rod., Drape over yourself each night upon going to bed. Push it out a long way from your face and head so that it doesn't bother you. If the netting doesn't adequately catch itself to keep the open area shut, use binder clips or similar to keep it closed during sleep.

Tie back hooks and tie backs are optional additions but helpful for keeping the netting off the bed when not in use. Or, just tie it all in a loose hanging knot above your head.

Make a loop.,
Run a needle through the center.,
Wrap the thread around.,
Add a center knot.,
Attach the bow to the barrette.,
Add the finishing touches.",How to Make Girl Hair Bows1," For this simple hair bow, all you need is a length of ribbon, a threaded needle, a hot glue gun and a hair barrette.


If you're just making the hair bow for fun, you don't need to worry too much about the length of the ribbon.
However, if you need a hair bow of a specific size, you should cut a length of ribbon that's double the length of the desired bow, plus one inch.
For example, if you want a two-inch hair bow you would measure out four inches, plus an extra inch (to allow for overlap).;
, Fold the length of ribbon over to make a circular loop, so that the two ends overlap by about half an inch. Make sure the right side of the ribbon is facing out (especially if the ribbon is patterned).

, Press down on the center of the ribbon to flatten the loop. Take your needle and thread and run your needle through the center of the folded ribbon, from the back to the front.

, Fold the center of the bow, accordion style. Then wrap the thread around the center several times to secure. Knot the thread, then cut the rest.

, Take a second piece of ribbon and tie a basic knot. Position the knot over the center of the bow, then secure the ends of the ribbon at the back using some hot glue or a small stitch.

, Place a little hot glue on top of the barrette, then firmly attach the bow. Leave to dry for an hour before using.

, If you like, you can add some extra embellishments to the bow by hot gluing some sequins on or using some fabric glitter.


You can also layer the bow by making a second bow with a contrasting colored ribbon. Place one bow on top of the other, then add the center knot (which wraps around both bows) before gluing to the barrette."

Repeat Step 4.,
Slide both ends of the necklace into the clip and secure.",How to Make Loom Bands5," You'll need an assortment of loom bands, a plastic C-clip or S-clip, and a little patience. This project is longer than the bracelets, so it will require more bands and more time to make.

, Don't twist them. Hold your thumb and index finger so that the bands stretch a little.

, Slip one end of this band through the loop at the other end to form a slipknot, and pull to tighten.

, You should have a circle made of four loops. Slide two more bands through the loops. Make sure you slide these new bands through all four loops!

, Continue forming circles with your bands and sliding new bands through them. You'll see a chain start to form. Repeat this process until the necklace is as long as you want it.


You can vary the number of bands you use for each ""link"" in your necklace; fewer bands will form a thinner link, while more bands will form a chunkier link.

2 x 75” (1.9 metres) (frame lengths).

, Use 2-inch (0.78"") nails to nail together the pieces of wood., Use 2-inch (0.78"") nails again to attach the legs at each corner of the frame., It must surround the bed completely., Adjust it to ensure that it is sitting evenly over the frame and that there is equal drape of the netting on each side. The mesh sheet should be well centered.

Ensure slack so that the sheet drapes onto and a little across the floor, forming a barrier that prevents mosquito entry from under the bed. About 6 to 12 inches (15.2 to 30.4cm) of the mesh sheet must touch the floor, each side.

, Nail through a plastic/rubber washer or bottle cap to stop the sheet from tearing on the nails. Use a one-inch nail for each leg., To use the mosquito net, lift up a sheet on either side of the bed and get into bed. Drop the sheet back to the floor so that it sits completely on the floor with no gaps. Sleep tight."

Gather your supplies.,
Make the loops.,
Secure with thread.,
Make a second and third bow.,
Put the bows together.,
Make the center knot and attach to the barrette.,
Trim the tails of the bow.",How to Make Girl Hair Bows2," To make a layered hair bow, you will need three lengths of ribbon in complimentary colors or patterns - one piece of ribbon will be used to form your ""main bow"" so it should be wider than the other two. You will also need a glue gun, a threaded needle with a knot tied at the end, some scissors, a bottle of fray check and a barrette.

, Take your widest piece of ribbon and make a loop in the center, similar to the loop you make when you're tying a shoelace.


This first loop will determine the size of the finished bow, so readjust it until you find a size you like. If you're using patterned ribbon, make sure the patterned side is facing out.
Holding the first loop securely with your thumb and forefinger, make a second loop on the opposite side. You should see the shape of a bow coming together.
Make a third and fourth loop, using the same technique. The fourth loop should come down across the center of the ribbon (from left to right) to form the second tail of the bow.
At this point, take a second to readjust each of the loops, to make sure they are all the same size.

, Holding the four loops securely at the center point with your thumb and forefinger, grab the threaded needle in your other hand and run in the the center of the bow, from back to front.


Make a number of stitches through the center of the bow to secure it. It doesn't matter if the stitches are messy, as you won't be able to see them when the bow is finished. Tie a knot in the thread at the back of the bow, then cut the thread with your scissors.
If one of the tails on your bow is still attached to the spool of ribbon, cut it off. Keep the tails of the bow nice and long for now, you can cut them to your preferred length later.

, Take the two smaller lengths of ribbon and use the same method to make two more bows.


Try to make these bows slightly smaller than the last one, as you will be layering them on top of one another.

, Take your larger bow and sit the two smaller bows on top, making sure the centers are aligned.


Take your threaded needle and run it through the centers of all three bows, from back to front. Make several stitches to securely attach the bows.
After several stitches, take the thread and wrap it around the center of the bow several times. Pull it tight in order to scrunch up the center of the bow.
You may need to adjust the loops and the tails of the bow a little to make sure they are smoothed out and in the correct position.
After you've wrapped the thread around the center of the bow several times, bring it around and tie a knot in the back to secure, then cut the thread.

, Take a new piece of ribbon (it can be any of the three colors or patterns) and tie a simple knot. Readjust the ribbon to make sure the patterned side is facing out.


Align the knot over the center of the bow - this will cover up those messy stitches you made earlier!
Flip the bow around and use your glue gun to place a dot of glue on the center of the back of the bow. Take your barrette, open it, and press the top half into the glue.
Take one end of the knotted piece of ribbon and pass it through the open barrette. Press it down to stick it to the glue beneath. Cut off any excess.
Place a dab of glue on the piece of ribbon you just passed through the barrette, then take the opposite end of the knotted piece of ribbon and stick it in place. Cut off any excess.
Now the bow is securely attached to the barrette.

, Flip the bow over so it is facing the right way around. Take your scissors and trim all six tails of the bow.


The easiest way to do this is to trim them at an angle, from the outside in. How long or short you cut the tails is a matter of personal preference.
The final step is to take a bottle of fray check and run a small amount along the cut edge of each tail. This will prevent the ends from becoming frayed."

Ask your family if you can use brooches that have been inherited from grandmothers, aunts, sisters and cousins.,
Find low cost brooches at craft stores, like Michael's, JoAnn's or box stores like Target and Walmart.,
Buy collector's items on Etsy, eBay or Amazon.,
Add clip-on earrings, necklace pendants and hair accessories to your collection of brooches.,
Collect 50 to 80 brooches in total.,
Visit your local craft store and buy several things that you would use to make a fresh flower bouquet.,
Set up a work station at home.,
Take a brooch.,
Thread the green floral wire through the clasp or around the front of the brooch.

,
Pull it through so that the middle of the wire is wrapped around the brooch and the 2 ends are even at the bottom.,
Start twisting the 2 wires around each other approximately 1 inch (2.5cm) below the point where the wire and brooch are attached.

,
Wrap floral tape around the twisted wire.,
Repeat the process with each of your brooches.,
Choose your bouquet base.,

Place a strip of super glue at the end of your ribbon.,
Embellish as desired.",How to Make a Brooch Bouquet," Using some brooches from the family will personalize the project and make it a keepsake.


If your family members want the brooches back, you can choose to deconstruct the bouquet at a later date.;
,


Give yourself at least a few months to look for brooches. You can return to the clearance section of these stores and buy recently reduced merchandise to save money.

, If you have a special style of brooch, such as enamel, rhinestone or precious stone that you want to feature in your bouquet, it will take a little longer to collect enough brooches.

, These items look very similar to brooches when placed in a bouquet.

, The number you need will depend upon the diameter of the brooches and the size of the bouquet.

,


Buy long, green floral wire. These will become your brooch stems. Make sure you have enough for each brooch and 2 for larger brooches.
Find green floral wire. This is used to wrap the wire together.
Buy a large silk flower, such as a hydrangea, in the color of your choice. Inserting your brooches into the flower will help to fill out the empty space and protect your brooches from rubbing against each other. You can also choose a dozen flowers or several different types of silk flowers to intersperse among the brooches.
Buy ribbon. You will want to wrap the bouquet stems with ribbon to create an attractive and elegant holder.
Buy some needle-nosed pliers, wire clippers and a hot glue gun (with glue sticks), if you do not have these things already.

, Plug in your glue gun and gather all your supplies.


The glue gun is essential for brooches that break during the bouquet-making process. Low-cost brooches frequently break or lose stones. Glue the pieces on immediately so that you can still use them.

, Close the clasp and secure it with a hot glue gun if necessary.


Decide if your brooch will be secure if you wire it through the clasp. Some brooches break or have unsteady clasps. In this case, try to wrap the wire around the front of the clasp itself, between petals or stones.

,,


Use your needle-nosed pliers to wrap wire around delicate brooches. Bend the wire at the top with the pliers, so that it is securely attached to the clasp.

,, Floral tape can be flimsy, so make sure it overlaps as you curl it around the wire.


Press the ends of the floral tape securely so that it sticks well.

, Create a pile of brooch stems, until you feel you have enough to start making the bouquet.


Making brooch stems can be a time-consuming process. You may need to make 50 to 80 stems in several sessions.

, You can buy a bouquet holder or foam block to make a wider base with which to hold your bouquet.


In place of a bouquet base, find a foam noodle bath toy and cut it to the length of your base or vase height. The open center allows you to place the brooch stems inside.
You do not need to use a bouquet holder. You can add sticks or silk flower stems to make a wider vase. Place them together and wrap them with tape to secure a wider base.

, Insert your brooch stems into the spaces between the flower petals.


Make sure to alter the color and size of the brooches that are next to each other.

, Gather your brooch stems until you have a full bouquet shape.

,


Clip the wire stems with the wire cutters, if they are too long.

,, Use a hot glue gun. Allow the glue to dry well before you begin wrapping the ribbon.

,


When you get to the bottom, you can wrap the bottom with ribbon vertically and rewrap it horizontally or you can leave the stems showing for 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5cm)

, Tuck the end of the ribbon inside the other bands of ribbon at the top.

, You can wrap the base with a necklace or sew on pearls.

Inspect the closure details on the lariat.,
Do a basic loop.,
Tie it with a simple knot in the front.,
Create drama by double looping a long lariat.",How to Wear a Lariat Necklace1," Some lariat necklaces are meant to be tied a specific way, whereas others can be styled in a multitude of ways. The most basic lariat looks like a long chain, with some kind of open shape (often a circle) at one end. The other end of the chain is meant to be threaded through the open end and then you adjust it to your liking.Some lariats do not have pieces on the ends that thread through one another, so these have to be tied or arranged in some other way.;
, This is the easiest way to style a lariat. Drape the necklace around your neck, with the center part at the back of your neck. One end will hang over each shoulder. Grab an end in each hand and cross the chain in front of you. Loop one end under and then through, exactly the same way you would begin to tie your shoelaces. Let the two ends hang down.You can adjust the loop higher or lower, depending on what kind of effect you want to achieve.

, If you want to do something a little different with your lariat, try a front knot. The result can look very classy and looks great with formal wear and high-end business suits. Put the lariat around your neck, so that both ends drape over your shoulders and onto your chest. Grab both ends of the chain in one hand. Create a loop with both strands, then pull the ends of the lariat through the loop. This will tie a knot in the front.The final look very closely resembles a bolo tie.
Pair a front-knotted lariat with a black formal gown or dressy business ensemble.

, Fold the chain in half, so that both strands are running parallel to one another. Hold one end of the doubled necklace in each hand, then wrap the folded necklace around your neck. Pull the ends of the lariat to be in front. In the opposite hand, the doubled chain has created a loop. Pass the ends of the lariat through the loop. Feed them all the way through and allow the ends to hang down.This is also called the “scarf” style, since it follows the same pattern as a popular scarf-tying technique.This can create a dramatic, chunky style. Pair it with jeans and a leather jacket to create one look.
You could also wear it this way with a tight cocktail dress and create a similarly dramatic result, but with a different vibe.

Measure the length of the curtain.,
Measure the width of the curtain.,
Cut the fabric.,
Hem the curtain.,
Secure the long tab.,
Make the tabs.,
Hang the curtain.",How to Make Curtains2," Use a tape measure to determine the distance between the curtain rod and the floor.


Add 5 inches/12.7 cm to this number to account for the curtain's hem. If the distance between the curtain rod and the floor is 120 inches/3.05m, the result is 125 inches/3.18m.
Add 8 inches/20.3 cm to the total to account for the tabs on the curtain. If the curtain and hem total 125 inches/3.18m, you now have a length of 133 inches/3.38m.

, Use a tape measure to determine how wide the area is that you want covered. Include the amount of wall around the window that you want covered in the measurement.


Multiply the measurement by 1.25. If your original width was 24 inches/61cm, the cut fabric will need to have a total width of 30 inches/76cm.

, Cut the fabric according to the required length and width indicated by the measurements.

, Place the curtain on a flat surface. The wrong side of the fabric should face upward.


Fold a 1-inch/2.5cm hem along the bottom and top of the curtain. The hem should fold up against the wrong side of the fabric.
Use a needle and thread that matches the curtains to secure the hem with a whipstitch. A whipstitch is a shallow stitch that enters through the folded fabric, exits through the main part of the curtain, and enters again through the folded fabric. Whipstitch the entire length of the fold.
Fold another 3-inch/7.5cm hem along the top of the curtain.
Secure the hem with a whipstitch.

, Determine how long you want the tabs on the curtain to be. If you want the tabs to be 4 inches/10cm long, you will need a piece of fabric that is 8 inches/20cm long. Cut the fabric according to the width of the curtain and the desired height of the tabs.


Place the length of fabric on a flat surface. The wrong side of the fabric should face up.
Fold the fabric in half. You will now have a long tube of fabric from which you will cut the tabs.
Place the edges of the folded fabric on top of the 3-inch/7.5cm hem at the top of the curtain.
Use safety pins to pin the fabric to the hem.

, Determine how many tabs you want on the curtain. There should be no more than 5 inches/12.5cm between each tab.


Use scissors to cut spaces evenly from the long tube of fabric. Ensure that you do not cut through the curtain attached to the tube of fabric. You now have individual tabs secured to the curtain with safety pins.
Check that there is a tab on each side edge of the curtain.
Use a sewing machine to secure the edges of the tabs to the hem of the curtain.

, Loop the tabs around the curtain rod. Place the curtain rod into the hooks above the window. Done!

Use measuring tape to measure the window height from the point where the curtain rod will be to the bottom of the window.,
Measure length of the curtain rod.,
Divide the total width (with fullness factored in) by 2.,
Determine the length you want for each panel.,
Purchase the material.,
Lay out the material at home and measure each panel.

,

Sew the side seams down the length of each side of each sheer curtain panel.,
Hem the bottom of each panel.,
Make the sleeve for the curtain rod on each panel.,
Press the curtain panels lightly to remove any wrinkles in the fabric.

,
Slip the curtain rod through the sleeve at the top of the sheer curtain panels.",How to Make Curtains3," Decide how much longer you want your curtains to be than the window.

, Measure the circumference of the curtain rod and add 1 inch/2.5cm to allow for a seam.


How full your curtains are is a matter of personal taste. The average fullness is calculated by taking the total length of the curtain rod (sized to fit your window) and multiplying that number by 1.5. You can multiply by 2 for fuller curtains.

, This gives you the size of each of the 2 curtain panels you need. Again, this is a matter of taste. Two panels are normal, but, if you want more, just divide the total width by the number of panels you want to hang.


You need to add 2 inches/5cm for each panel to the width of the curtain panels for seams and finishing.

, Add the length plus 4 inches/10cm plus the circumference of the curtain rod.

, Take the measurements with you so you know how much material to purchase. Material on bolts comes in 2 widths - 45 inches/1.125 m and 60 inches/1.5m. Home decorating fabric is mostly found in just the 60-inch (1.5 m) size.


Convert the measurements into yards (meters), since raw material is sold by the yard (meter). To do this, divide the total width and length by 36 (100 for metric).
Also purchase thread to match the material.

,, Be aware that sheer material can be hard to cut. Make sure the scissors are sharp and you will want to stabilize the material on each side of the cut line with something heavy such as a book.

,


Fold over 1/8 inch/3mm and press with a warm iron.
Fold the remaining 7/8 inches/2.2 cm and press.
Stitch it to make a 1-inch/2.5 cm side seam on each side of each panel.

, Fold over 1 inch/2.5 cm and press. Fold over 2 inches/5 cm more and press and then stitch the seam for a hem. This will leave you with the circumference of the curtain rod, plus 1 inch/2.5 cm for top sleeve and seam allowance.

, Fold over 1/8 inches/3mm and press. Fold over 7/8 inches/2.2 cm plus the circumference of the curtain rod, press and sew the curtain sleeve seam.

,, It's now time to hang your new curtains.

"
"
Understand the measurements.,
Gather your sheets and sewing supplies.

,
Using a seam ripper, open ""just"" the side seams of the hem at the top of each sheet.,
Measure the width of the curtain rod.,
Make a rod pocket.,
Iron the sheets.

,
Slide the rods into the pockets and hang your simple-as curtains.

",How to Make Curtains4," Gathered curtains are usually 1.5 to 2.0 times wider than a window. Most windows require two twin sheets. Twin sheets are 66"" x 96"". Full sheets are 66"" x 102"". Queen sheets are 90"" x 102"". King sheets are 108"" x 102"".

,, Most hems are about 4 inches/8cm wide.

, Add width plus a 1/4 inch for movement within a rod pocket.

, Make a straight horizontal stitch above the hemline of the sheet, accommodating for the width of the curtain rod. The remaining fabric at the top of the sheet will become the ruffle.

Wrap it in a choker style.,
Try “the wrap around” style.,
Wear it backwards.",How to Wear a Lariat Necklace2," Take one end of the lariat in your hand and place it right below your collarbone. Then wrap the rest of the lariat around your neck once (or twice, if your lariat is a lengthy one). Loop one of the strands over in the front. This will secure the lariat in place.This style is easy to create and works great with low necklines, so that the “choker” aspect is clearly visible.

, Grab an end in each hand, then place the center part at the back of your neck. Cross one piece over to the opposite side and wrap it around the back of your neck. Pull the end over your shoulder and allow it to hang there. Do the same thing with the other piece. You can leave it like this, or you can loop one strand over the other to secure it.Allow the ends to hang down after you loop the strands.

, Thread one end of the lariat through the closure on the other end, as you normally would. Then rotate the necklace so that the long pieces hang down your back rather than in front. This works great with a low or open back dress, and can be a gorgeous and unique way to show off intricate details on the back of your dress.It has been a recent trend among brides to use this technique while with their wedding dresses.

"

Pair them with a deep v-neckline.,
Try it with a striped top or dress.,
Layer them with other necklaces.",How to Wear a Lariat Necklace3," Lariat necklaces feature long strands that hang vertically down the front of your body. To show off the necklace, wear a neckline that complements the way it hangs. A deep v-neck is a great choice, since the shape of many lariats create a v-shape themselves. The double v effect can be very visually flattering.A v-neckline is only one option. You could also try tops with sweetheart, scoop, off-the-shoulder and square necklines, along with strapless tops.

, The vertical lines created by long lariat strands can look really interesting when paired with stripes. While horizontal stripes create the most contrast, vertical stripes mimic the way the lariat hangs, so experiment with both looks to see what you like best.Go for a garment with a simple stripe pattern in two colors so the overall effect isn’t too busy.

, Lariats tend to look very striking when paired with multiple necklaces of varying lengths. Try wearing one of your favorite chokers, a pendant and a lariat together with a low-cut or open shirt that allows you to show off the unique jewelry.You could also layer dainty gold or silver chokers with a thin-chained lariat for a trendy and glamorous look.Keep your clothing simple and monochrome if you want the jewelry to be the star of the show.

If necessary, clean your beads.,
Get all your supplies together.,
Take apart your necklace.,
String the beads, working off the spool.,
Attach the clasp.,
Alternatively, try a knotting method.,
Finish the other end of your necklace.",How to Restring a Necklace1," If the necklace you're restringing has been through some wear and tear (which is likely why it broke), it's likely that the beads could use some love. Oils from your body or cosmetics (or even just time) can dull any bead and make it look less than glamorous. Buy a jewelry cleaner and use a child's toothbrush to start – the gentler, the better.


You never know which beads aren't going to take to cleaning, so it's best to play it safe in the beginning. Glass and crystal should do fine, but simulated pearls and plastics could be another story. Always do one single bead before you go cleaning the entire lot to make sure the method you're using is safe.;
, It's best to do this in one afternoon so the beads don't end up magically rolling away from you. Here's everything you'll need:



Stringing material and clasp. Nylon coated cable beading strands are best for most any project. They're widely available at craft stores and come on spools in different weights, strengths and colors. Don't be tempted to use thread – it'll likely fray and break, leading you back to this article in the future.

Chainnose pliers and cutters. If you don't already have a suitable pair of pliers, it's wise to obtain a jewelry repair kit. They'll also come with a crimping tool, which is doubly helpful for sealing off your strands.

Bead tips. These are the beads that are used on the end that attach to a clasp on either end. They have a ""clam shell"" or ""cup"" on the sides.

Crimp beads. These are soft metal beads with large holes. They can be mashed against the stringing material to hold it in place.

Glass seed beads. These can be used as spaces if you need a longer necklace. They come in so many varieties you should be able to match your other beads.

A beading board, mat, or towel for a work surface. A beading board has a whole bunch of groves to keep your beads in place. If you don't have one of these, a towel can also be useful to keep the beads from running off. Avoid working on wood or tile at all costs.

, Don't bother trying to keep the beads on their original string. There likely won't be space enough for both strings and it'll be harder to work with, so just take them off. Set them on your surface and slide out the string so they stay in order.


You probably have bead tips on the ends of your necklace – the ones that are attached to your clasps. You can take your pliers and open up the loop on those beads to get them off the clasp and get every piece free.
If you have multiple strands you're dealing with, just work on one strand at a time. If you unstring all your strands, that's just creating a recipe for disaster.

, For strong bead cord, you don't need a needle. It'll slide through the bead holes on its own. Simply slide the beads on the cord one by one, still working off the spool. That way if you need more length, it's hardly a problem. Just be careful not to put any tension on the string; even though it's brand new, it could still warp.


When you're finished putting the beads back on, take a look at it. Are all the beads in their pattern correct? Is it long or short enough?
If for some reason you can't work off the spool, get a length of bead cord that's about six inches (15 cm) longer than you think you need. Tie a knot at one end and secure it with craft glue. Then you can go about stringing on your beads (just remember to start with a bead tip)., Once all your beads are on, string on a crimp bead, a bead tip, and a seed bead. Here's where it starts to take know-how:Pass your cord back through the hole in the bead tip, leaving the seed bead to catch on the inside, and pass back through the crimp bead.
Place the seed bead snugly inside the bead tip and place the crimp bead up against the bead tip.
Mash the crimp bead against the stringing material with your pliers.
To make sure it all stays in place, use a drop of craft glue or nail polish inside the bead tip before closing it over the seed bead.
Then, slide a bead over the free tail of your bead cord, then clip the string close to the bead so the tail is tucked inside.

, If that all sounded like gobbledegook, you can try simply tying a knot in the end of your cord, as close to the bead tip as you can. Then, secure this with craft glue. Cut off the extra cord so the knot can hide in your bead tip.


Then, you can slide your clasp onto the bead tip hook. Use your pliers to close the hook so the clasp can't slide off.

, If you're working from a spool, cut the cord free, leaving about two extra inches (5 cm). Hold each end in your hands so the beads settle and the cord lays naturally.


Repeat the same method on this end as you did with the first clasp. If you're using clam-shell type bead tips, make sure to close them over the seed beads and to use your pliers to close the hook.

Once all the beads are on, remove the needle.,
Tie a knot after each bead.,
Keep on knotting between each bead.,
Cut off the extra thread on the other side to finish off.,
Seal it with either super glue or a small, brief flame.",How to Restring a Necklace2," If you have a bead tray, great – if you don't, work on a towel, large piece of felt, or even foam. Keeping the order of beads is pretty important, and you don't want them rolling all over the place.

, Here's everything you'll need:


Your beads
Clasp
A beading needle (a fine needle with a large eye)
Thread, either silk or synthetic
A match or lighter (for burning off loose ends of synthetic thread)
Super glue and toothpick (if using silk thread)
Scissors or clippers

, This isn't your normal ""thread the needle"" step. You're actually threading it to thread it. It'll all be clear in a second. Here's how it's done:


Take about 10"" (25 cm) of your thread and separate it into finer strands.
Take one of the fine strands and thread that through the needle.
Tie a knot so the strand makes a loop that goes through the eye of the needle (this loop holds the thread that will be the string of your necklace. It enlarges the eye of the needle, making it much easier)
Cut off a strand of thread about 3x the length of your desired necklace.
Double it over and put the loose ends through the loop you've already made. Don't knot this string; just leave it be. Make sure it's pulled far enough to avoid the string slipping out, however. Now your needle is officially, albeit strangely, threaded.

, Take the clasp from your original necklace (or a new one) and loop the thread through it. To do this, just put the needle through the ring on the clasp and then back through the end loop in the thread.


You may want to tie a knot close to the clasp at this point. It will keep the loop from slipping up onto the ring incorrectly.

, Simply thread the beads onto the string with the needle, pushing the beads to the edge of the clasp. Go slowly so you get the pattern correct – you don't want all the beads on only to realize that you messed it up once halfway through.

, Tie a double knot at the end where there are two loose ends on your string (opposite the clasp). Then, push the beads to this newly knotted end.

, Take one bead and then slide it over to the clasp. On the side of the bead opposite the clasp, tie a tiny knot to keep it in place.


It'll be helpful if you hold the loop down on the bead and then tighten. Keep this tension as you pull the knot shut.
After each knot, separate the threads and pull them apart to move the knot closer to the pearl. You don't want the knot to be visible.
You could also put a needle through the knot and use it to guide the knot against the pearls.

, Grab the next bead and bring it next to the knot you just made. Tie another knot, keeping a finger over it as it's being pulled to keep it snug. Keep doing this until all your beads have been moved over and knotted to the side with the clasp.


This is a skill and you will get better with practice. It may take a few necklaces to get it right. They will get tighter as you go.

, After you've knotted each bead, cut off the end thread knot you made a while ago. Then, put those ends through the other side of the same clasp. Pull the thread tightly up the last knotted pearl and tie a good, sturdy double knot.

, If you're using silk thread, you can apply a tiny dot of super glue onto the end with a toothpick. Then, cut the thread close to the knot after the glue is dry.


If you're using synthetic thread, cut within 1/4"" (.8cm) and melt the short, loose ends with the flick of a small flame. Note: be careful. It's possible you could melt your necklace.Be very, very, very brief with this.

Hold the clipper with the blades down and work against the direction of your hair's growth, so you can catch more hair with the guard.








,
Take care not to go too fast so you don't tug on the hair or hit your scalp.,
Remove the guard and turn the clipper over in your hand.,
Draw the clipper down from the hairline at the back of the neck to clip the hair in that region.,
Cut a line at the bottom of the sideburns, comparing their lengths to ensure they're even.,
Clean your clippers by brushing the blades free of hair, disinfecting them with alcohol and then applying a thin film of oil.",How to Use Hair Clippers," Every hair clipper comes with a number of attachments that allow you to cut your hair to different lengths. Many people choose to cut the sides of their hair shorter than the top.









The longest is a size 7 or 8, depending on the clipper, which leaves about an inch of hair on your head.
Using a guard shorter than a size 4 will show your scalp, which leaves you vulnerable to sunburn.;
, Never cut wet hair with clippers because this will cause the blades to rust.








,, By going slowly, you not only ensure that you're giving a comfortable cut, but a smooth, even one as well. Your goal is to cut all the hair in one pass.








, Carefully cut a clean line at the back of the neck and around the ears. Go slowly so you don't make a mistake.








, This leaves the neck feeling smooth and comfortable.








, If you or the person whose hair you're cutting has facial hair, use a guard to provide a smooth transition from the sideburns to the beard.








, Use the oil that came with the clippers.

Add the elastic.,
Sew the elastic together.,
Sew the fabric ends together by hand.,
Accessorize your scrunchie.,
Test the strength.,
Wear it!",How to Make Scrunchies," Use elastic that’s between 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) and 1 inch (2.54 cm) wide. It should be about 4 inches (10 cm) long, or 1 inch (2.5 cm) more if your hair is extra thick., Your final piece of fabric should be about 8 inches (20.32 cm) long and 4 inches (10 cm) wide if you use 4 inches (10 cm) of elastic. Add 2 inches (5.1 cm) onto the length if you added 1 inch (2.5 cm) to the elastic length. There's no need to adjust the width of the fabric. Fold the longest side of a rectangular piece of fabric at about 4 inches (10 cm) from the edge in order to cut along the fold., Remember to always cut a little bit extra fabric just in case you need more to sew. Feel free to cut past your initial measurements. Oftentimes you can take fabric in, but you can’t take it out once it’s cut., Fold the fabric you cut out in half lengthwise so that the printed or colored side is facing inwards. Pin and sew a straight line by hand or with a sewing machine, leaving about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

, After you sew the long side of your fabric, you should have a tube with two open ends. Turn the tube so the printed sides are facing out., Attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic, and feed it through the fabric tube. Make sure to hold the other end of the elastic so it is not pulled through the tube. Pin the two ends of elastic together so that they overlap slightly., Sew stitches in the shape of a square so that the square covers the overlap, and then sew a diagonal through this box. The x-box stitch will ensure that the elastic will not come apart when you tug on it.Hand sew or use a sewing machine for this part.
Make sure not to sew the fabric to the elastic during this step.

, Use a whip stitch so the stitching will not be seen from the outside of the scrunchie. To make a whip stitch, first place the raw edges of the fabric on top of each other and fold the ends slightly inward. Sew stitches around the ends, alternating the stitch between each fabric end., Tie or sew coordinating ribbons, bows and other accessories to add unique flair to your scrunchie. Use bells for Christmas, dangling hearts for Valentine's Day or red and blue ribbon for 4th of July. Be creative by attaching silk flowers or sequins., Carefully pull your hair into a loose ponytail. The scrunchie should be able to be pulled like a regular elastic. If the scrunchie breaks, don't be discouraged! Try making another, but focus on strongly sewing the elastic together.

, Sweep your hair off your shoulders or neck and show off your new scrunchie. Wear a loose ponytail, or pull your hair up with a regular elastic and put your homemade scrunchie over the top if you want it extra tight.

Thread the line along the pattern once more to create the second lead.,
Starting at the working end, carefully pull the line back through the knot, away from the working end, until the end is about 2 inches (5 cm) long.,
Tie the working end and standing part together.,
Cut off the standing part and slide the ring off the end of the object.",How to Tie a Ring," The bumps around the edge are called ""bights"". The strands making up the ring are ""leads"" (as in a dog lead, not the element lead ). This method produces a 2-lead, 5-bight ring, like the one in the picture. With minor adaptations, you can make rings that have 3 leads or 8 bights, but these require more line. The ""working end"" is the end of the line that you are using to make the ring.
, You may need to tie a few experimental rings to determine the right diameter. In general, a smaller object is better, as you can wrap paper around it to increase the diameter. An object that is too large cannot be made smaller., This is the amount of line that you will need.,,,,,,,,,,,

At this stage, if desired, you can thread the line along the pattern again to make a third lead, or add a bead to the ring.

, At each stage, pull tightly to tighten up the ring. Keep going until you reach the standing part (the part not used in the ring), Make this knot as close to the ring as you can. A reef knot works very well. Add a dab of superglue to this knot to hold it in place., Finished!"

A micro-ring loader. This is a small wire device that makes it easy to thread a shrink link onto your hair. It's like a giant needle threader.
Keratin remover. This is a product you apply to the glued area when your'e ready to take out the feather. You could also just wait until it falls out in two or so months.;
, You can fit up to five feathers in one extension for an extremely feathery look, but most people choose to go with two to three. Pick feathers that look good next to each other. They can both be the same color, or you could go with two different colors for a striking effect.


For example, you could pick one hot pink and one hot green feather for a super summery look.
Or go with one feather in a striking color like electric blue or yellow to peek out from among your locks.
If you want to go with a natural feather look, choose two to three brown or cream feathers of varying lengths.

, Your hair should be clean so that the glue stays in place. Part your hair the way you normally do and pick out a small section of hair, about the width of a red cocktail straw, in the area where you want the feathers. Don't choose the lock from the very top layer of your hair; pick it up from underneath the top layer, so that the top layer of your hair will hide the glue and the tip of the feather from view.


You can apply the feathers toward your scalp or lower in your hair. You can also choose to apply two or more sets of feathers to the same lock of hair.
If you want the world to see your feather extensions every day, choose a lock toward the front and top of your head. This is a popular style for younger girls.
For a subtler, more mature look, pick a lock toward the bottom and back or side of your head. This way it will peek out when you move or turn your head, but you can pull it back if you need to for more formal settings.

, Pull the lock of hair into the center of the shield to hold it in place, then pin the shield to your scalp using bobby pins. This will protect your head from getting burned by the iron.

, Place one of the keratin shrinkies onto the base of the microloader. Put your lock of hair into the microloader's loop, then push the shrink link up until it slips onto the lock of hair. Pull your hair through the microloader and set it aside. You should now have one shrink link loaded onto your lock of hair.You'll want to set the shrink link about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from your scalp to make sure it doesn't hurt your head while you're sleeping at night.

, Take the feathers you're using and place the tips inside the shrink link, so that the feathers are pointing down. Position the feathers against each other the way you want them to look, and hold them in place against your lock of hair with the tips inside the shrink link. Insert them far enough in so that the hard tips of the feathers come through to the other side of the link.

, Apply the heated hair extension iron to the shrink link. Keep it clamped there for 15 seconds while the shrink link melts and attaches the feathers to your hair. Release the iron and set it aside, then clasp the shrink link between your fingers and squeeze and roll it a little to make sure the feathers stay in place.

, Take a sharp scissors and very carefully clip the tips of the feathers so they don't stick out from the top of the link. Let the feather fall into place and adjust your top layer of hair to cover it.

, The extension will fall out in two or three months. The more often you wash it, the faster it will fall out. If you get tired of it before it falls out, use keratin remover to remove the glued shrink link. Be sure to remove it carefully instead of trying to pull it out, since your hair can get damaged and rip if you pull it.

Pull your hair through the bead.,
Slip a feather into the bead.,
Clamp the bead to your hair.,
Take the feather out when you're ready.",How to Put Feathers in Your Hair2," This method doesn't last quite as long as the glue method, but since you aren't actually adhering the feathers to your hair, there's a little less potential for hair damage. The beading method requires a different array of supplies, all of which can be found at craft stores, beauty stores and online. Gather the following:A fun array of feathers, such as saddle hackle or chinchilla hackle in a variety of colors and lengths.
Silicone hair extension beads that match the color of your hair. They come in brown, black, blonde, and other colors.
A hair extension hook or a small crochet hook tiny enough that you can slip one of the beads over it.
A pair of pliers.

, Part your hair the way you normally do and pick out a small section of hair that's thin enough to fit through your silicone bead in the area where you want the feathers. Don't choose the lock from the very top layer of your hair; pick it up from underneath the top layer, so that the top layer of your hair will hide the bead and the tip of the feather from view.

, Take your lock of hair and wrap it around the crochet hook toward the hook part at the very tip. Just wrap it around one time.

, Slide the bead up over your hair and pull your hair through the bead using the hook. If the whole lock doesn't fit, just pull through as much hair as you can. Make sure there's enough hair in the bead to hold the weight of the feathers with ease, since over time heavy feathers can pull out the hair. Situate the bead about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from your scalp, so it doesn't hurt while you sleep at night.

, The feather should lay flat against your scalp and point toward your tips. This method is best for using just one feather at a time. If you have two small feathers that fit, you could try attaching them both at once., Use your needle nose pliers to grasp the bead and clamp the feather tight against your hair. Use your strength to make sure it's tightly in place. Let your hair fall into place and style it as normal.

, To remove the feather, just use your pliers to crimp the bead in the opposite direction, so that it opens back up and slips easily out of your hair. Do not attempt to pull the feather and bead out, since you could pull out your hair and cause damage.

Pick a thinner scrunchie for a modern look.,
Experiment with prints and patterns.,
Select a color that matches your outfit and style.,

Hold up a bun with a thick scrunchie.,
Tie a loose, low ponytail with a scrunchie.,
Try a high ponytail.,
Do a bubble ponytail.,
Avoid distracting materials.,
Blend your scrunchie into your look.,
Avoid neon shades.",How to Wear a Scrunchie," Many scrunchies, especially those popular in the '90's, were famously thick and had a lot of excess fabric bunched around the elastic band. It is no longer fashionable to have a scrunchie dominate your look. Therefore, look for thinner scrunchies without a lot of excess bulk due to fabric. This makes for a more mature, classy look.However, a thick scrunchie is sometimes necessary if you're doing something like a bun that requires extra support.;
, Modern scrunchies now come in a variety of patterns and styles. Sites like Etsy sell scrunchies in a variety of prints and patterns.Select a scrunchie with a pattern that works for your particular outfit.


For example, you can try a scrunchie to match your outfit. Try pairing a checkerboard dress with a checkerboard scrunchie.

, Scrunchies often come in bright, noticeable colors. You should opt for a scrunchie with a color that matches or compliments your outfit. When wearing purple, for example, go for a purple scrunchie or one in a complimentary color such as yellow.

, A scrunchie can be used at the end of a long braid in place of a hair tie. Braid your hair together in the back. You can either tie it with a scrunchie or a tie it with a hair tie and then place a scrunchie over it.Thicker hair may need to be tied with a tighter hair tie before you put in the scrunchie.


When using a scrunchie with a braid, the scrunchie will become the primary focus of your hairstyle. If you want to highlight a scrunchie with an attractive color or pattern, a braid is a great way to do so.

, A thick bun on the top of your head can be held in place with a scrunchie. This provides a slight '90s throwback appeal. It also puts the scrunchie front and center. This can work great if you're matching colored scrunchies with your clothing., Part your hair to the side and then gather it together near the nape of your neck. Keep it loose enough that your top ears are covered by your hair. Loop the scrunchie around your hair slightly lower than the nape of your neck. This will make a fun, casual ponytail. Your scrunchie will look great with a more casual look.If you want your ponytail a little loser, shake your head back and forth a little after putting your scrunchie.

, A scrunchie can prevent the awkward dent often found in the middle of a high ponytail. To make a high ponytail with a scrunchie, flip your hair over the front of your head. Brush your hair upward to remove lumps. Then, secure your hair together at the top of your head with a scrunchie., A bubble ponytail looks cute and a little quirky when secured with scrunchies. It's simple to do. Make a low ponytail. Then, add two more scrunchies to the ponytail. Keep all the scrunchies at equal distance from one another.If you want a very quirky look, use scrunchies in different patterns or colors.

, Flashy scrunchies are no longer considered fashionable. Things like glitter and metallic materials are no longer popular for a scrunchie look. Avoid scrunchies with a lot of flash or scrunchies made from unusual materials, such as very fuzzy scrunchies., Scrunchies were often used as eye-catching accessories. They tended to be bright and flashy and attracted a lot of attention.Now, they should generally be blended into your main look. Pick scrunchies that go with your outfit rather than working against it. Similar colors and patterns can help your scrunchie blend into your attire.


For example, if you're wearing a checkerboard dress, select a matching checkerboard scrunchie.

, Some scrunchies come in extremely gaudy shades. While very bright colored or neon scrunchies were popular in the '90s, they are no longer considered in style. Opt for scrunchies in more played down colors."

Add the two-hole button enclosure.,
Wear the finished product.",How to Make Beaded Bracelets2," For this project, you will braid a bracelet out of waxed linen cord. As you braid, your will slide beads onto the the strands. Unravel your waxed linen cord on a flat surface. Use a ruler and scissors to measure and cut a 26 inch strand of waxed linen cord and a 19 inch strand of waxed linen cord., Fold the 26 inch strand of waxed linen in half. Fold the 19 inch strand in half and place it on top of the 26 inch strand. Pull one end of the 19 inch strand down so that it aligns with the two ends of the 26 inch strand. Tie a knot in the two strands approximately ½ inch from the top of the loops. Cut off the short end of the 19 inch strand so that there are three even strands remaining., In order for this bracelet to maintain its shape, you must create a tight, traditional 3-strand braid.


Cross the left cord over the center cord.
Cross the right cord over the center cord.
Cross the left cord over the center cord.
Cross the right cord over the center cord.
Repeat this process until the braid is approximately 1 inch long., The center section of the bracelet contains an assortment of size 8/0 Seed Beads. For this project, your will need between 50 to 70 beads. As you braid the waxed linen cord, you will add beads to the cord in the following pattern:


Thread 1 bead onto the left strand. Push the bead to the base of the braid and cross the left cord over the middle cord.
String 1 bead onto the right cord and push it to the base of the braid. Cross the right thread over the middle thread.
Thread 1 bead onto the left strand. Push the bead to the base of the braid and cross the left cord over the middle cord.
String 1 bead onto the right cord and push it to the base of the braid. Cross the right thread over the middle thread.
Repeat this process until the bracelet is approximately 1 inch shy of fitting your wrist.
As you braid, keep your thumb at the base of the braid to prevent the beads from slipping., After adding the last bead, you will add another braided section. When the new section is approximately 1 inch long, wrap the bracelet around your wrist to ensure that it is the proper length. If you need to extend the length, continue braiding the cord until it reaches the appropriate length. Tie the three cords in a knot directly below the base of the braid., To secure your bracelet around your wrist, you will use a button-and-loop enclosure. Retrieve your two-hole button. Insert two strands through one of the button’s hole and one strand through the other hole. Tie the ends in a knot to secure the button in place. Trim the ends of your bracelet., Wrap the bracelet around your wrist. Slip the button through the loop on the other end.


Stack several of these bracelets on your wrist for a chic look."

Cut out ten wire circles from memory wire.,
Form a 1 cm loop on each wire circle and semi-circle.,
String the beads onto the metal circles.,
String the nine wire circles together.,
Braid the cuff.,Join the ends and complete the bracelet.",How to Make Beaded Bracelets3," Memory wire is a coiled metal wire the maintains, or remembers, its circular shape. This material, which is similar in appearance to a slinky, is the perfect material for creating beaded cuff bracelets. Use a pair of wire cutters to cut 10 circles of memory wire. Cut one of the ten wire circles in half., To prevent the beads from falling off the memory wire, you must twist one end of each metal circle inward. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to bend one end of a wire circle inwards. The bent end will form a 1 cm loop. Repeat this process on the remaining eight circles and each half circle., For this project, you will need three different colors of Hama, or Perler, beads. String three metal circles with the first color (color A) of beads, three metal circles with the second color (color B) of beads, and three metal circles with the third color (color C) of beads. Leave one centimeter of the wire uncovered. Close the other end of the circle by creating a small inward loop with your needle nose pliers., Stack the metal circles on top of each other in the following order: Color A, Color A, Color A, Color B, Color B, Color B, Color C, Color C, Color C. Pass one of the two wire semi-circles through the enclosure loops found on the left ends of the wire circles. Trim the semi circle approximately 1 centimeter away from the beaded circles. Use the needle nose pliers to create a small inward enclosure loop., Each set of three like-colored beaded loops forms one strand. Plait the strands in a traditional 3-strand braid:


Pass Color C over Color B.

Finished.

",How to Make Beaded Bracelets4," This project requires leather or suede cord. Unravel 2 feet of the leather or suede cord and fold the cord in half. Wrap the folded piece of cord loosely around your wrist. Adjust the length of the cord so that you can easily wrap it around your wrist twice. When you have settled on a length, use a pair of scissors to cut the cord., Cut a piece of thread approximately 3 ½ feet in length. Slide the thread through the eye of the needle. Fold the thread in half and tie the ends together in several knots., For this project, you will need between 70 to 90 beads.


Bend the cord and align its ends so that they are even.

Tie a knot at both ends of the base cord.",How to Make Paracord Ranger Beads," You are making a shape that sort of looks like a tilted ""4."" The looped part should be pointing upward. The top cord should be pointing to the right, and the bottom cord to the left. Most of the cord should be on the right side.Try to use 550 paracord, if you can.You will need about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) of paracord to make one bead.;
, Fold and twist the right-hand cord into another loop. It should be overlapping the first one. Again, the front cord should be pointing to the right., Hold the two loops so that the right edge of the first one is in the middle of the second one. Thread the right end of the cord down through the second loop and up through the first one. Weave it back down through the first loop. You will now have three loops., You will now have four loops with a hole in the center., Pull the end of the cord upward so that it is parallel to the edge of the second loop. Twist and adjust the looped cord until you have a ring shape., Cut 30-inch (76.2-centimeter) length of paracord in a contrasting color.If you can, try to use 550 paracord., Make sure that you are pushing it through the folded end first. Stop when you have about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) sticking out of the top of the ring., Gently tug on both ends of the bead's cord. Then, tug on the loop, one by one, until the bead tightens. Keep pulling here and tugging there, until the bead is snug around the folded cord. It needs to be loose enough so that you can still slide it up and down., The bead will have two long cords sticking out of it. Cut these off as close to the bead as you can. Some types of paracord are white inside, which will show. If you want a nicer finish, color the white part in with a marker. Use a color that matches the paracord., The cut ends of the cords will fray if you don't. Using a heating rod, press the end of the tool against the cut end of the bead. Roll it back and forth, then left it away. The cut end of the cord will have melted and sealed itself.You can also seal the beads with a lighter., Paracord ranger beads are used for counting paces. You will need a total of 14 beads for your counter. You want 9 beads at the bottom of your counter, followed by a knot, then 5 more beads.Leave enough space between the knots so that you can slide the beads apart.

, Hook it onto a clip or keychain ring.You can also skip the knot at the top (looped) part of the cord, and feed it through a keychain ring in a slipknot instead."

Obtain an empty Pringles can.,
Carefully take your cutter and cut a band about an inch or inch and a half wide all around the can.

,
Cut 2 or 3 depending how many bracelets you want.

Choose flexible paper.,
Cut a strip of paper about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm) wide along the side.,
Wrap the bracelet around a cylindrical object.,
Make the sides overlap each other.,
Glue the overlapping parts together, using a glue stick.,
Decorate your wristband using colored pencils, pens, or crayons.,
Let the wristband dry.,
Slide your wristband off the cylinder.",How to Make a Wristband1," The paper should be durable enough that it will not rip or tear, but flexible enough that you can bend it easily to form the wristband. Choose colored paper, if desired.


You can use more than one color paper to make a multi-colored wristband.
Construction paper will do fine for a temporary bracelet, but may not last very long.
Scrapbook paper is both strong, and flexible enough for use as a wrist band. Consider using scrapbook paper if you have or can get some. Scrapbook paper can be purchased at most craft stores, and comes in a variety of patterns.;
, The strip should be long enough that you can wrap it around your wrist, or the wrist of the person who will be wearing the wristband.


If you want to create a wristband with an additional layer of paper, for contrast, you can cut a second strip of paper about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm), This will allow you to form the wristband without having to use your own wrist, which makes it much more difficult to work because you will only have one free hand.


A soda can work as a cylinder for this purpose, full or empty.
No matter what you use, make sure that it has a big enough circumference that you will be able to get the wristband on and off.

, An inch or two of overlap is enough. It does not matter which side is on top.


If you overlap the sides too little, the wristband will be more fragile, and more easily fall apart.

, Glue will be more secure than tape, and be less prone to coming undone. Other kinds of glue can also be used, but avoid particularly harsh or toxic glues, because it may touch your skin. Glue sticks are entirely sufficient for gluing paper to paper.Make sure that you do not accidentally glue the wristband to the cylinder. If you do, you might not be able to get it off. In that case, you will have to start over.
Repeat this process for the thinner strip of paper, if you are choosing to use one. Center and overlay the second, thin strip on the first, thicker strip. Then, glue it down to the first strip.

, Your decoration is limited only by your imagination. You may want to avoid using markers, particularly on construction paper. Markers can bleed through the paper, weakening the wristband and potentially getting on your skin.


Optionally, you can use material like glitter or rhinestones to further decorate your wrist band. Spread glue on the area you want to glue something to the wrist band, then stick the item where you want it.

, After gluing and decorating your wristband, let the glue dry. If you take the wristband off the cylinder before it is dry, it is more likely to fall apart.


It only takes a few minutes for a glue stick to dry. You should not have to wait long, but be patient. For other glue types, check the instructions on the bottle.

, After you have removed it from the cylinder, the wristband is ready to wear!

Find or buy a sock with a thick cuff.,
Cut the cuff off the sock.,
Turn the ends of the cuff over about ¼ inch and sew them them back onto the cuff to form a hem.,
Decorate the wristband.",How to Make a Wristband2," The cuff will become the wristband after a little work, so make sure you like the color and material. Thicker cuffs will make for more durable wristbands, generally speaking.


You can use an old sock with holes in it as a way to recycle, if you have a suitable sock., Try to cut the sock as close to the cuff as possible. It is better to err on the side of cutting below the cuff, as you will be hemming the cuff in the next step.


Use a sturdy, sharp pair of scissors. If you use scissors that are too dull, there is a greater chance that you will end up fraying the fabric. If you fray the fabric too much, you might have to start over with a different sock.

, Sew all the way around the circumference of the sock to finish the hem. Choose a thread color that you like, or thread that is the same color as the sock cuff. To quickly hem the wristband, stick the needle through the fabric and immediately back up through, just above the fold. Now pull the needle all the way through. Then continue stitching up through the fold, pulling the needle through, connecting the fold with the rest of the fabric. Move along the seam and repeat the process until you have sewn all the way around the circumference. When finished, you’ve created a basic hem. Hemming the wristband will prevent the fabric from unravelling.
Make sure that you do not sew all the way through the cuff. If you do, you will sew both sides together. In that case you will have to cut the thread out with scissors and begin again.

, You can sew patches on to the wristband. Smalls pins and pin-back buttons also make good decorations for this kind of wristband.


Make sure that all pins are secured and that the points are not exposed. They pose a risk for cutting yourself when you put your hand through the wristband.

",How to Make a Zipper Bracelet1," Zippers come in a variety of colors and styles. For this project, you will be braiding zippers together, so pick a few different colors. Shop online, or at a craft store, for the following materials:3 7-inch YKK Zippers
12 fold over crimp ends
7 mm jump rings
Lobster clasp
Scissors
Chain nose pliers
Bent nose pliers;
, On each zipper you should see a small metal clasp connecting the two zipper sides. Turn the zipper over and look for the small metal prongs connecting the two sides. Use the chain nose pliers to bend the prongs up, and pull the clasp off.Pull the zipper slide down, and separate the two pieces.You can also use scissors to remove the clasp. Cut across the zipper just above the clasp. You will lose some length from your bracelet if you use scissors instead of the chain nose pliers.Repeat this process for each zipper, until you have 6 individual pieces. Use the same method for each zipper., Use your scissors to remove the zipper teeth from each piece. Cut along the teeth, removing any excess cloth from the zipper. Set each strand of zipper teeth aside., Place a crimp end at each end of each strand of zipper teeth. Fold each side of the crimp over and push them down to close the crimp around the strand.Give the crimp a slight pull to make sure it's secure., The number of jump rings you'll need for your bracelet will depend on your wrist size. You will need both sets of pliers to open the jump rings.Hold one side of the jump ring with the chain nose pliers, and one side with the bent nose pliers. Make sure the opening of the jump ring is between the pliers.Pull one pair of pliers towards you, and push the other pair away from you. Don't pull the pliers to the side. Try to maintain the circle shape of the ring, and take care not to pull the ring apart., Thread each of the zipper strands onto the jump ring, and use the pliers to push the jump ring back together. Thread some wire through the jump ring and tie it around something to secure the bracelet.You could also secure the bracelet using tape or a clipboard.
Make three sets of two zippers and braid the zippers together. Keep one set on the left side, one in the middle, and one on the right.The set that was on the left is now in the middle. Cross the right set over this set. Now, the right set is in the middle. Cross the set that is currently on the left, over the set in the middle. Continue this process until you have finished braiding the zippers.When you have finished braiding the zippers, secure the loose ends in another jump ring., Open another jump ring and put a lobster clasp on it. Put the jump ring with the lobster clasp on it through one of the jump rings on the end of the bracelet.Add as many jump rings as you need to the other end of the bracelet. Don't make your bracelet too tight. It should fit comfortably around your wrist.,"

",How to Make a Zipper Bracelet2," All you need to make a simple zipper bracelet is one 9"" zipper, a pair of fabric scissors, some embroidery floss, and an embroidery needle.You may want to keep some clear nail polish on hand in case your zipper starts to fray as you're working with it.You should be able to find everything you need at a craft store.

, Use your fabric scissors to cut away any excess cloth from the zipper. Cut as close to the teeth as you can. If your zipper starts to fray, use a little clear nail polish to seal the ends., Measure and cut the zipper strand to the desired length. This bracelet does not have a clasp, so make sure you have enough so that you can fit the bracelet over your wrist.Thread your needle with embroidery floss. Insert the needle between the zipper teeth on one end of the strand. Pull the other end of the bracelet around, and join the two sides together by sticking the needle through the other end.Make sure there is some overlap between each end. Wind the embroidery floss around both sides. Keep it tight and make sure the ends are secure.To finish tying the ends together, thread the needle back through the zipper ends and tie a knot. Cut off any excess zipper.,"

",How to Make a Zipper Bracelet4," To make a zipper pattern bracelet you will need three different colors of thread. One of the colors will act as the base for the bracelet, and won't be visible in the final product. Aside from the thread, you will need a few more things.Make sure you have something to secure the thread with. A clipboard works well for this, but you could also use tape, or a safety pin.Keep some scissors on hand so you can cut the thread when you need to., The amount of thread you need will depend on what you are making, who you are making it for, and what kind of knot you are using. Start working with several feet of thread, and periodically measure your bracelet until you reach the right length.Cut two threads of each color you decide to use. Make all the threads the same length.Put all the threads together and tie a knot a few inches from one end. When you've finished your bracelet, these loose ends will serve as ties., If you are using a clipboard, secure your bracelet just beneath the knot. If you are using tape, find a flat surface and tape the knot of your bracelet down., Divide your threads by color. You should have one color on the left, one in the middle, and one on the right., Take the color on the left (L) and bring it over the color in the middle (M). The threads should look something like the number ""4.""Take thread L and bring it through the loop you just created. Pull the thread tight until the knot is secure at the top. This is the first hitch in a forward/backward knot.The threads have now switched place. Take color L, which is now in the middle, and bring it over color M, which is now on the left. The threads should look something like the letter ""P."" This is a mirror image of the first hitch you made.Bring thread L through the loop you just made, and pull the thread tight until the knot is secure at the top. This is the second hitch in a forward/backward knot. The threads should now be back in the same position as they were in the beginning., Start with the color on the right (R). You will be doing the reverse of the knot you just tied. This knot is called a backward/forward knot. Bring color R over color M. You should have something that looks like the letter ""P.""Bring color R through the loop you just made, and pull the thread tight until the knot is secure at the top. Then, place color R, which is now in the middle, over color M. Pull color R through the loop, and pull the knot tight.After the second knot is complete, your threads should be back in the starting position., The zipper pattern bracelet is one continuous series of forward/backward knots, and backward/forward knots. Continue tying your knots until your bracelet is the desired length., Once you've reached the desired length, take the threads and tie them in a knot at the end of your zipper pattern. Leave some excess thread to tie your bracelet on, and cut off the rest.

Gather your materials.,
Mark the center of your paracord.,
Tie a lanyard knot.,
Make a simple overhand knot.,
Connect the paracord to the carabiner.,
Cobra stitch the paracord.,
King cobra stitch the paracord.,
Cut and melt the loose ends.",How to Make a Paracord Lanyard," To make a paracord lanyard, you will need at least 6–13 feet of paracord 550, a metal carabiner clip, snap hook, or metal key ring, a ruler or tape measure, a twist tie (or something to easily mark a the center of the cord), scissors, and a lighter.The proportions of the paracord can differ depending on how long you want your lanyard to be. For about every foot of paracord length used, you will get about an inch of your braiding knots.If you want to make a lanyard using just cobra stitching, you may only need about 6–8 feet of paracord. However, if you want to make a king cobra stitched lanyard, you may need about 13 feet.
For example, 8 feet of paracord will yield about 8 inches of braiding knots for your lanyard.;
, Fold your long, 6–13 foot paracord in half. At the top of the fold, mark the center by tying a twist tie or rubber band around the paracord.You can really use whatever kind of marker you want, just make sure that it can stay put as you make your knot, and then easily be removed.

, If you are tying this knot for the first time, it may be beneficial to use a sheet of paper to visualize how the cords intertwine to tie the know. Poke two holes vertically, on top of each other, about 4 inches apart through the middle of the paper. Feed the loose ends of the paracord through the holes in the paper, and have the looped end of the cord on the left side of the paper, while the loose ends through the paper go off to the right.Pull the cords all the way through the paper so there is no visible loop hanging on the left side, but rather, the ""loop"" is flush against the paper. You will need about a two-inch loop by the time you’re finished with the knot, so having the cords pulled flush against the paper can help you achieve this. Lay the paper flat on a table.


Take the paracord passing through the bottom hole of the paper, and make a loop near the paper hole.Then take the paracord passing through the top hole, and place it underneath the bottom paracord’s loop. Have the cord sit through the middle of the loop. For example, the top cord should look like a center “pupil” running through an “eyeball” (the loop).Also place the upper cord underneath the bottom loop’s tail cord.
Feed the tag end of the top paracord down through the right side of the “eyeball,” underneath the “pupil,” and up through the left side of the “eyeball.”Gently pull both tails of the cords to tighten the knot just a little bit. You should have a very elaborate and mirrored knot pattern.
Take the tag end of the paracord coming from the bottom of the knot, bring it around to ""trace"" the right of the knot, past the top hole where the other cord is coming from, and underneath all of the upper cords, to come up through the “eyeball” center.The same technique will be used for the other tag end of the paracord.
Bring the upper paracord tail around to ""trace"" the left of the knot, past the bottom hole where the other cord is coming from, underneath all the lower cords, to come up through the “eyeball” center of the knot.Tear off the piece of paper, and hold onto the looped cord that was on the other side of the paper. Gradually pull and tug on both tag ends of the paracords while holding onto the looped cord.Make sure the looped side of the lanyard knot has about a two-inch loop.
The center of the paracord (marked) should be in the middle of that two-inch loop., If the lanyard knot seems too complicated and intricate, you can make a simple overhand knot.From the looped portion of the paracord, pinch down the paracord about 2 inches from the top of the loop. Twist the loop over the tag ends to make another larger hoop, and pull the center of the looped paracord through the middle of the larger hoop.

, Feed the two loose ends of the paracord through the loop of the carabiner clip, snap hook hole, or metal key ring.Pull the ends through the loop until the lanyard knot is about 5 inches away from the base of the clip.If the snap hook hole is pretty wide, you can loop the ends of the cord around one more time, to take up more of the wide space., The two end sides of the paracord are the two cords you will be knotting to create the cobra stitch. You will be knotting onto the two center cords running 5 inches down from the base of the carabiner. Take the left hand paracord, and fold it to the right, over and across the two center cords.Then take the right hand paracord, and pass it on top of the tail end of the left side paracord, under the two center cords, and up through the loop created by the left hand paracord.Then pull the loose ends tight.


To make the next knot, follow the same instructions, except reversed to the other side.Take the right hand paracord, and fold it to the left, across the two center cords. Then take the left hand paracord, and pass it on top of the tail end of the right side paracord, under the two center cords, and up through the loop created by the right hand paracord. Then pull the loose ends tight.
As you continue to knot, you are going to alternate which side of the paracord gets crossed over the two center cords to make the first loop.For example, for the first knot, you made the loop starting with the left hand paracord. For the next knot, start the loop with the right hand paracord. For the knot after that, start the loop with the left hand paracord, and so on and so forth.
Keep cobra stitching over the two center cords until you get 11 knot bumps on each side of the lanyard.If this lanyard is satisfactory to you, you can cut off the excess pieces and melt the loose ends to the rest of the paracord. However, if you want to use up the rest of your paracord, you can do a king cobra stitch.

, A King cobra stitch uses the same technique as a cobra stitch, it is just done on top of an existing cobra stitch, and makes the lanyard a bit thicker.Continue cobra stitching the paracords back toward the carabiner end using the same, alternating sides stitching technique you used earlier. Begin by making the first loop with the paracord that has just gone under a loop.


You can tell which paracord this is by looking at the sides and seeing which paracord is coming out underneath a bump loop on the lanyard.While making the king cobra stitches, you may need to use your fingers to push the knots up toward the top to make them even.However, the king cobra stitch sides will naturally end up matching up with the spaces in between the original cobra stitches., When you are finished king cobra stitching all the way back down to the end of the carabiner, cut off the loose ends of paracord. Leave about ¼-inch space on the snipped ends.Melt each snipped end with a lighter, using the lower, darker part of the flame to melt the paracord rather than burn it.After about 5-10 seconds of melting the paracord end, push the paracord against rest of the lanyard with the metal part of your lighter.This will help cool the melted paracord and connect the melted end to the rest of the lanyard.


Do this same melting procedure for the other snipped end of the paracord.When both loose ends of the paracord are melted and secure, you are ready to use your paracord lanyard.

Attach the jump rings.,
Decide how many strands you want going around your pumps.,
Attach the  jump rings in pairs.,
String each strand around your shoe and then cut it so it will not be so loose that it can snag and trip you.,
Attach the chains to the  respective jump rings, right and left.

,
  Test the assembly.",How to Make an Anklet with Draping Heel Chains," It might be gold, silver, or another material that strikes your fashion chord. You will also need jump rings, a clasp, and the tools listed in the ""Things You'll Need"" section.;
, It should not be excessively loose so you keep from snagging it on something. Cut the chain so that you will be able to easily clasp it around your ankle.

, You need to carefully consider where the assembly is clasped so that will easily wrap around your ankle and shoe. Perhaps having it in front is easiest. 

, If you have some way to secure the anklet, it will help the attachment process proceed more smoothly.

, Two, three, or four are popular choices, but follow your head. You will need two jump rings for every strand of chain.


Since pumps are not all the same there is the possibility that your ankle jewelry will not fit every shoe you had hoped to pair with the anklet. It is best to check measurements if you intend to use this on different shoes and aim to maximize the flexibility of the anklet.

, Each jump ring should be opposite its partner, but not necessarily 180º apart.


If you attach one end of of each loop chain to the main chain will make it easier to measure.

,


To keep the strands straight, it may be helpful to mark each strand if you did not already attach them.

,, Put on your pumps and wrap the chain around your ankle, working the strands around your heel, then engage the clasp.

Take your knife and cut the white away from the ball in two separate sections.,
Peel away the two tongue shaped leather pieces.,
Once you’ve peeled away the two leather portions, peel the seam off of the ball in one piece.

,
Turn the seam inside-out, looking for the beginning and ending strings for the baseball seam.,
Once you have located the ends, turn the whole seam right-side-out.,
Once you have the sticky, stringy mess removed and your seam is neatly trimmed up, go ahead and work the end threads out, exposing eight needle holes (four on each side).

,
Cut the seam, across the leather, leaving equal space on both sides.,
Fold the seam in half.,
Gently ease out the thread from the newly cut ends.,
Once you have tied the ends, trim the threads, but do not trim the leather.

,
Cut a piece of suede cord to ten inches.,
Trim your leather.,
And there you have it!",How to Make Baseball Seam Bracelets," Do not cut through the red seam.;
,


The ball will look like this:







,, Under all of the stringy stuff, it will look something like the picture above. You do not want to inadvertently cut these because you will need to use them for tying off your bracelets.

, Trim the leather as close to the stitching as you feel comfortable. You can trim very close or leave a larger margin. And don’t even worry about, or try to remove the tacky, stringy stuff from the back side of the stitching until after you have trimmed up the leather. It will come off very easily, in one big clump, once you have trimmed along the shape of the outside seam (as you can see in the picture).

,, You will have one long, misshapen seam. Do not worry about the shape of the leather, when your bracelets are complete, they will have a natural, circular shape to them. Attempting to stretch and shape will do not a bit of good at this point.

, Cut across the leather again, leaving yourself with two bracelets.#*As you can see, you will have a very natural shape for your bracelets.

, Give yourself enough stitching that you can tie a square knot on the back side of the bracelet to keep the thread from coming undone.

,, Run your cording through the existing needle holes, giving your bracelets a soft, tying clasp.


Something that will make the cording easier to thread through the holes in the leather is to cut it at a drastic, pointed angle.
You can use needle nosed pliers or a pencil to help push the end of the cording through the holes on each side.

,


Repeat on the other end to finish your bracelet.

, Easy-peasy with a great wow factor! ”Play ball!”

Measure out at least three coils of memory wire, add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), and cut it using a pair of wire cutters.,
Use your round-nose plies to make a small loop at one end of the wire.,
Thread your beads onto the wire, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) tail.,
Fold the tail end of the wire into another loop.,
Consider adding a charm using a jump ring.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Memory Wire Bracelet1," Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters; they are much too delicate. Use pair of heavy duty ones instead. Memory wire is hard, and it can easily dull a good pair of wire cutters., Pinch the end of your wire with a pair of round-nose pliers. Twist the wire around the top of the pliers to form a loop, then pull the pliers out. Use the plies to squeeze the loop smaller, if needed. This will hold the beads in place and prevent them from sliding off the end of the wire.

, You can use different shapes, sizes, and colors of beads, or just one type for something simple. You can even use a different type of bead on each coil.


Don't cover the entire wire with beads. Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tail at the end..
Small beads, such as bicorns and seed beads work great for memory wire bracelets. Avoid using any large, chunky beads, especially towards the end, as they might slide past the loops.

, Pinch the end of the wire with your round-nose pliers, and wrap the wire around it to form a loop. Pull the pliers out, and use them to pinch the loop smaller, if necessary.

, Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to pull apart a jump ring. Slip a charm onto the jump ring, then place the ring where you want it on the bracelet. Use the needle-nose pliers to close the ring. Great places to put charms include at either end of the bracelet, or in the middle between two beads.

Cut 9 coils of memory wire.,
Use a pair of round-nose pliers to make a small loop at one end of each piece of memory wire.,
String your beads onto the wires, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) tail of bare wire.,
Use your round-nose pliers to make another loop at the end of each piece of beaded memory wire.,

Make a small loop at the top of each piece of beading wire.,
String the memory wires onto one of the short beading wires.,
Close the bottom of the short wire with a loop.,
Braid the memory wires.,
Slip the remaining short wire through the end loops on the beaded memory wire strands, and close it with a loop.If you used seed beads or spacer beads on the first short wire, remember to use them here too.",How to Make a Memory Wire Bracelet2," You will end up with 9 rings made out of memory wire. You can have the ends of the rings overlap a little if you'd like extra space on your bracelet.Do not use your good, jewelry wire cutters for this, or they may get ruined. Use a sturdy pair of hardware pliers instead.


For a thicker bracelet, cut 12 coils.

, Pinch the end of a piece of wire with the round-nose pliers. Wrap the wire over the top of the pliers to form a loop. Pull the pliers out, then pinch the loop smaller if it is too big.Do not make a loop on both ends of the wire pieces or you won't be able to get the beads on.

, The best beads to use are seed beads, but you can add some larger, bicone beads in various places for a more interesting design. Do not cover the entire wire with beads; you need that gap at the end so that you can ""close"" the wire.

, This will close the wire and prevent the beads from falling off. Once you are done with all of the pieces, set them aside.

, You will be using these to hold your beaded memory wire strands together.

, The loop should be fairly small, but big enough so that the doesn't slip through the end loops on your beaded memory wire coils.

, You can separate the memory wire coils with a seed bead or a spacer bead, if you'd like something fancier.Make sure that all of the memory wires are coiled in the same direction.

, Once you have gotten all of the memory wire coils onto the short wire, use a pair of wire cutters to trim it down to ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Use the round-nose plies to fold the end of the short wire into a small loop.This will hold your memory wire strands together.

, Separate the wires into three groups. If you used 9 coils, each group should have 3 strands. If you used 12 coils, each group should have 4 strands. Loosely braid the strands together.

, Your bracelet is now complete and ready to wear!

Trim the wire back from both ends of the coil, so that you have 2¾ coils.,
Glue an end cap or cord cap onto each end of the cord.,
Wait 30 minutes for the glue to dry, then add some charms, if desired.,
Let the glue dry completely before wearing the bracelet.",How to Make a Memory Wire Bracelet3," Cut them using a pair of wire cutters. Try to use the heavy duty kind, and not your good jewelry wire cutters. Memory wire is strong, and can easily dull a good pair of wire cutters.

, You must use braided leather cord. Regular leather cord won't work because it doesn't have any room inside for the wire.The recommended size is 6mm. If you can't get cord in that size, use the next closest one you can find.

, Do not tape over the ends, or you won't be able to feed the fire through it. Try to use a narrow piece of tape; cut it in half lengthwise if needed. You will be leaving the tape on the cord. If it is too wide, it will peak out from under the caps., Some cords have rubber tubing inside. If your cord has rubber tubing, simply thread the wire through it. You may have to use a pair of pliers to pull the wire through the cord at the end.

, This will make it easier to slip the end caps on. To trim the wire, push the cord down a little, the cut the wire using a pair of wire cutters. Repeat this step for the other end of the coil as well.

, Place a few drops of super glue into the cup part of the cap, then push the cap onto the end of the cord. You will need to twist the cap in order to get it all the way on. Repeat for the other end of the bracelet.


The tape should be covered completely by the cap, so you should not have to remove it.
The recommended size is 6mm. If you are using a different sized cord, however, then make sure that you get caps that match that cord. For example, if your cord is 4mm, then get 4mm caps.
If you'd like to add charms to your caps, get the kind that have loops on the end.
You can use any color your want, but silver will look best with black leather; brass will look best with brown leather.

, Open up a jump ring, then slip a charm into it. Poke one of the ends of the jump ring through the loop at the end of an end cap, then close it.If you'd want a simpler bracelet, you can skip this step.

, This may take up to 24 hours. Once the glue has dried, your bracelet is ready to wear.

Take a piece of the base color duct tape and measure your wrist so you have about an inch extra;
,Take the same color and length and lay it right on top so there is no sticky part left on the tape

,
Take a piece of a different colored duct tape the same length as the first two and fold it in half so there is not sticky part showing and it is thinner than the other pieces.

,
After you do that make another one exactly the same as the thin one and lay them on the base color strip so it looks like racing stripes down the center.

,
Then take the clear tape and lay it on top of the stripes and the base so they stick together and don't move.

,
Then take that same color you used for the racing stripes and make the another racing stripe but don't put it on the base yet.

, Using embroidery thread or nylon strings, stretch an odd number (nine, for example) of strings in the color you want for your letters across the length of the strip. These strings will need to be about 4-5"" longer on either end than the strip. Secure the letter strings in place by wrapping the background color string around the strip in several carefully aligned loops at one end.

, You will vary the order in which the strings are wrapped in order to get the different letters. The any one or more of the letter strings will be moved either to the left or right, and then the back color strings will be wrapped around the the strip either behind or on top of the letter strings.

, Wrap a few rows of the back color before starting on your letters. You want your letters to be centered on the bracelet.

Choose colours.,
Look for beads.,
Visualize.,
Prepare a little workspace where you will start.,

Start the bracelet.,
Be patient.,
Start.,
Done!",How to Make a Holiday Bracelet as a Gift," We already have a general theme ""Holidays!"". Although, what type of holidays? Is it maybe Easter Holidays, or Christmas holidays? It is up to you! In this article we will focus on making a Christmas theme bracelet, but you can easily change the colours to suit your holiday!;
, Colours are very important in a bracelet, and they should suit the theme. Probably the first things that come in mind for ""colours on Christmas"" would be green and red, and maybe gold. These are great colours and complement Christmas decorations/clothes.


Remember your colour theme for the next step.

, Searching for the right beads are sometimes hard, which is why you must plan, because planning prepares you. First, have a look around the selection of beads that match your colour choice, and think of a plan in your head. What do you want your bracelet to look like? Will it have big beads and small beads, will it follow a pattern, or will it have a small charm in the middle, then follow red and green small beads?

, Before purchasing the beads, visualize some different variations of the bracelet you would like to make, then buy the beads when/if you are sure you are happy with the selection you have. It is a good idea to buy a bit more beads than what you need in case you switch ideas for the bracelet, but remember do not over-buy beads!

, Hopefully your beads are still in separate little baggies.


Do not dump them all into a big container! It will be hard to find them!

Find the centre of your piece: On the string you are using for the bracelet, find the centre to use for separation, or where you will put a charm in the middle. No matter the design, it is good to know the centre.
Pattern or no pattern? Choose if you like a pattern on your bracelet like ""red, green, gold, OR red, red, green, green, gold, gold. No matter what the pattern it should be repetitive and you should not stop halfway through. Continue the pattern all the way.
Plain is a choice: Sometimes, less is more! Some simple bracelets look beautiful, especially if you use a three stranded bracelet (which is a bit more difficult) and use 1 row of red, another of green and last of gold, but that is up to you!

, Now that you are ready to start, make sure you know who you are making the bracelet for, so you have enough string. Maybe measure their other bracelets, and leave a bit more space in case you need it. Remember, if you have too little string, you cannot add more, but if you have too much, you can always cut it!

, The process of making a bracelet is hard, so prepare to be patient and take some breaks once in a while!

, You can begin by tying a knot on the beginning of the piece, then continuing with beading. Stop every now and then to check out how your pattern is going. Remember to check the middle!

, Once the bracelet is done, secure the ends in whichever method you use, or get a grown -up to help you do the ends. Wrap up the present and it is ready!

Choose your fork.,
Bend the fork with your hands.,
Secure the end of the fork.,
Wrap the fork with a protective material.,
Bend the body of the fork.,
Curve the fork tines.,
Roll the outer fork tines.,
Roll one of the inner fork tines.,
Curve the other inner fork tine.,
Make adjustments.",How to Make a Fork Bracelet," Look to buy forks at garage sales or thrift stores. Usually, silverware sold at garage sales and thrift stores are relatively cheap. The fork that you buy also needs to be made of silver or sterling silver. That’s because silver and sterling silver is very easy to manipulate and bend. Forks that are silver or sterling silver will have the numbers “900” or “925” stamped on the back of the fork.Consider looking for forks that have decorative detailing on the handle. It can add some flair when you wear it as a bracelet.
Because stainless steel is less pliable, avoid using stainless steel forks to make your bracelet.;
, Use your hands to bend the fork following the natural curve of the back of the fork (the curves area around the base of the fork tines).Position the fork upside down, with the face of the fork turned toward the ground. Grip one hand over the root and tines of the fork, and position your other hand on the end handle of the fork. With the hand that is gripping the end of the fork, extend your thumb out to the neck of the fork, so it can act as a fulcrum while you bend.Apply pressure to bend and curve the front portion of the fork (with the tines) downward. Once the root and tines are bent, slide your hands down the body of the fork, bending the handle little by little.
When you are finished bending the fork with your hands, the fork should be bent into a relatively even “U” shape.

, Use an adjustable wrench to hold steady the end of the fork as you bend the body of the fork with pliers.Twist the adjustable screw on the head of the wrench to open up the wrench jaws. Position the end of the fork between the jaws of the wrench, placing the fork on the stationary top jaw.


Twist the adjusting screw to raise the lower jaw of the wrench, and clamp down tightly on the fork’s end.

, Wrap the end portion of the fork with a small square of thick cloth material like corduroy or denim. The cloth can be as small as a square inch, it just has to completely surround and cover both the top and bottom surfaces of the fork. This is so the pliers don’t leave small indents in the body of the fork as your grip and bend it.


Hold the protective cloth in place with a couple fingers of the hand that is gripping the adjustable wrench, so you can pick up the pliers with your free hand.

, Position the wrapped end area of the fork in between the open pinchers of the needle nose pliers. Squeeze together the handles of the pliers to clamp down the pinchers on the wrapped portion of the body of the fork closest to the tines of the fork.Firmly grip the adjustable wrench, and apply force to turn the needle nose pliers down, bending the body of the fork.


Each bend you make, slide the protective material and the pliers down toward the end of the fork (toward the wrench) and keep making little bends.When you are finished bending with the pliers, the body of the fork should look rounded instead of the “U” shape from earlier.

, Once the body has been bent into a rounder shape, loosen and remove the adjustable wrench from the end of the fork. Wrap the tines of the fork with the protective material, and use the same needle nose pliers to clamp down over the protective material. Position the pliers so they clamp down on two of the four fork tines. While one hand is holding the body of the fork, use downward pressure to bend two tines at a tine, following the natural curve of the fork tines.Once you curve two tines into a rounder shape, flip the fork to the other side, clamp the pliers down, and bend the other two tines.
Be sure to make your tine bends smooth and even. You can adjust and move the pliers in small increments to bend the tines at different points, but try to avoid making choppy and rough bends in the tines., Use the tip of your jewelry pliers to grip the tip of one of the outside tines of the fork. Twist the pliers laterally, to roll the tine outward until the tip of the tine is rolled and touches the outside edge of the tine. Do this on both outside fork tines.

, Use the tip of the jewelry pliers to grip the tip of one of the inner fork tines. Twist the pliers to roll the tine back on it self, rolling in the opposite direction of the curve of the bracelet and the natural curve of the tines.Roll the tine all the way down to the root of the tines. Release the small jewelry pliers and grip the needle nose pliers along the sides rolled up tine (the pliers should be parallel with the rest of the fork tines).


Twist the roll to the side, so it’s perpendicular to the fork tines. Then bend down the rolled tine so it can lay flat on the back of the fork root.
The rolled tine will most likely not be completely flesh against the fork root, so use the needle nose pliers to clamp down on the rolled tine, and press it flat against the fork root., In the same manner you rolled the outer fork tines to the sides until the tips met the edges of the tines, roll back the tip of the other inner fork tine. Grip the inner tine with the small jewelry pliers, and twist the pliers to roll the tine back on itself, moving in the opposite direction of the natural curve of the tines.Roll the tip of the tine backward until the tip touches the tine again.

, Use your hands to bend the bracelet and make any adjustments to the curvature or opening of the bracelet. You can pull apart or push together the bracelet ends to modify how large you want to bracelet opening to be.

Get ideas.,
Gather supplies.,
Buy your clasp.",How to Make a Bracelet1," Before you begin making your bracelets, think about what you want to make. Knowing what you want to do will make you better prepared, ensuring that you don’t waste time and supplies on something that you don’t really want as well as allowing you to make a better-looking final product.


Look at your own collection. Look at your own bracelets, purchased or made by others. You can recreate or take ideas from aspects of pieces you already own and like. Maybe you like a particular type of bead or clasp or color. You will also want to look at your own collection to decide if there is a type of bracelet that you might need. Look for holes in your collection, such as a lack of casual bracelets for everyday use, and think about what you can make to fill that need.
Look at what others have. You can similarly get ideas from bracelets that you see on other people. Does your best friend have a bracelet that you absolutely love? Try to recreate the qualities that you like about the bracelet so that you too can have the look. You can also look to fashion magazines and celebrities for inspiration.
Browse local jewelry stores. Go to stores that specialize in jewelry, like Claire’s, or larger stores with jewelry departments, like Macy’s, to get ideas about what you might want to make. The wide selection in stores like these will allow you to get more ideas, as well as helping you stay at the front of fashion trends.
Browse the internet. The internet is a great place to look for crafting ideas. Websites like Pinterest allow you to not only collect ideas but also find brand new ones through the lists that others have created. You can search by looking for just bracelets or you can also try to search by style, color, or materials. The internet can be useful because you can often find ideas as well as instructions.;
, In order to make your bracelet you will need supplies. These can be simple and inexpensive or they can be elaborate and more costly. It depends on your personal preference, as well as your needs. Supplies are easily acquired from a variety of locations.


Craft stores. You can find a wealth of supplies from local craft stores. Bead stores specifically, if you have one nearby, will have supplies just for making bracelets. A wide variety of options should be available, as well as a staff to advise you on needed supplies and techniques. Craft stores will also often offer classes and other resources, so be sure to ask about what is available to you or join their mailing list for announcements.
Thrift stores and vintage shops. You can purchase older items to upcycle into a brand new bracelet with a vintage feel. Try stores like Goodwill or local vintage or resale shops. You can use old earrings to make charms or reuse beads from necklaces and bracelets. Upcycling like this is environmentally friendly, by helping to reduce waste, as well as being very cost-effective.
Farmer’s Markets and local artists. Try farmer’s markets to see what local artists in your area are creating. You may find bead-makers with beautiful work, perfect for your next project. You can also find local artisans though nearby art shops or on the internet. Buying from artists such as these will help support your local economy, as well as supporting local arts and crafting culture.

, No matter what type or style of bracelet you are making, the clasps will largely be the same as they are based more on preference. Go to a craft or bead store and buy whichever type of clasp you prefer. Keep in mind how you will be able to attach it to the string to ensure that the clasp will work with your project.Simple clasps, such as a toggle or hook and eye, might be better if you want to be able to get the bracelet on and off quickly or if you prefer a more artistic look.
Lobster claw clasps tend to be the most popular clasps on jewelry in recent years. They are simpler to use and very secure, which will help ensure that you do not lose your bracelet.
Barrel clasps, which screw together, tend to be more common on children’s jewelry. This is because they are strong and secure but require less coordination and dexterity to put on than some other clasps. They are, however, better suited to necklaces than bracelets.
Bows and ties. Another option is to use the thread itself as a clasp, by leaving it long and tying a bow to keep the bracelet closed. This can be done by using a ribbon to build your bracelet or with other materials like raffia or coarse string. It is important to note that thicker or wider string is necessary for this type of closure, as thinner strings will easily break or come undone.

Buy supplies.,
Thread the buttons.,
Finish the bracelet.",How to Make a Bracelet2," You can make a fun, colorful, and casual bracelet by lacing together buttons with fishing line. Buy regular, two-hole buttons in slightly varying sizes and colors, depending on your own personal style. You will also need a length of fishing line or elastic thread, doubled up to add strength.

, Thread the buttons together by going up through the right hole and then down through the left. Take the next button and thread the string down through the right hole and up through the left. The next button should be laced as the first. Continue in this way until the bracelet is long enough.


You can gauge the length either by measuring your wrist beforehand or by simply trying the bracelet on occasionally through the process.

, Add the clasp of your choice and you’re done! This is a great bracelet to wear with your everyday clothing. It can add color to an outfit, as well as adding a little quirky, feminine charm.

Choose your look.,
Buy your beads.,
Find string.,
String the beads onto the thread that you have chosen.",How to Make a Bracelet3," For a more formal look, you can make a bracelet that’s perfect for a cocktail dress and a night on the town. A stylish, elegant look can be created with a simple string of circular beads. This will give you the string of pearls look without the string of pearls price.

, Depending on your style and preference, look for either metal, pearl, or imitation pearl beads. They should be roughly pea-sized.


These should be simple. Try not to use more than three colors and be sure that the colors you use are similar. You may wish to get the beads in a few slightly different sizes. Use them in a random or semi-random pattern to give your bracelet a little variation.
You may also want to get very small beads to put in between the larger ones. These act as spacers and can create a slightly different look, as well as making your bracelet more flexible.

, Next get fishing line or strong thread. Elastic strings can also be used if you do not want your bracelet to have a clasp. This will be used to string the beads together. It may be possible to use ribbon and do a bow closure, but this will depend on the size of your beads and their center holes.


Measure your wrist and add length depending upon how loose you would like your bracelet to fit. You can also gauge length by measuring other bracelets you have. Be sure to leave an extra at the ends, to attach the clasp if you wish to have one or to tie the elastic strings if you do not. Any unnecessary thread will be cut later.

, Arrange them how you feel it looks best. Attach the clasp you have chose to use, using the method recommended on its packaging. Trim extra threads and you’re done!

"
"
Get materials.,
Make the beads.,
String the bracelet.",How to Make a Bracelet4," You will need ribbon, plastic beads, straws, wrapping paper, glue, and scissors. Choose the specifics of the beads, paper, and ribbon according to your style. Try to get colors which match well together and fit your child’s personality.

, You will make the beads by covering the straw in the wrapping paper. This will be something that the child can do largely unaided, if they are old enough. These straw beads will be more cost effective than glass beads and also safer for the child to wear.


Begin by cutting the paper into small triangles, perhaps an inch to an inch and a half across the long side. Brush glue onto the backside of the paper and then roll the paper onto the straw. Cut off the section that is now covered in the paper to form the bead.







, Alternate the straw beads with the plastic beads and then tie the ribbon in a bow to create the closer. You’re done! This is a great project to do with your child as it will allow them to express their creativity while practicing hand-eye coordination as well as other important skills.

Stay simple.,
Leather braid.,
Braid the strings.,
Make the clasp.",How to Make a Bracelet5," Men tend to prefer simple looks using masculine materials. Use materials like leather and metal, and wooden or glass beads as opposed to colorful plastics. Avoid bright colors and ribbons. If, however, you know that the man in your life would prefer something different, go with what you know they would like.

, An easy style to try would be a simple leather braid. Begin by purchasing leather strings in whichever color you prefer. You may even get a variety of colors and mix them.


These string should appear even and not be too wide, as this will make them easier to braid. You will also want to ensure that the leather is strong. It should not be too thin, like the leather used to line clothing.
You do not need to get real leather. If you object to the use of animal products, faux leather can be easily purchased to create the same look.

, Braid the strings in as complex or simple a pattern as you wish. You can do a standard braid or you can look up more complex braiding in either a book or on the internet. Try a French sennit or various Celtic knotting techniques. Weave until you have reached the desired length.

, Finish by creating a toggle clasp by knotting one end of the extra strings and creating a loop with the other. Be sure that the knot is small enough to fit through the loop but not so small that it comes out too easily. A little extra string coming from the knot can help ensure that the clasp will stay closed. Alternatively, the ends can simply be tied. You’re done!

,


First, you have to remove the threading. You can just pull it out using tweezers and scissors.
Once the threading is removed, you can just peel the skin off of the ball. The leather skin will come off in 2 pieces as shown.

, Here, you are going to take the bead you chose to use as a clasp and string the elastic cord through it. Now, tie a knot around it, you want it to be kind of tight, to secure it in place., At this point your needle will be on the outside (white side) of the baseball skin., Tie and secure the thread around the elastic cord so your bead stays in place., You want your loop to be small enough for the piece you chose as the clasp to not be able to fall through without stretching the cord., At this point your needle will be on the outside (white side) of the baseball skin.,, Cut a piece of the felt you picked out into the same size and shape as the piece of leather skin.,, Sew in the new thread using the same holes that the original baseball thread made in the leather by:


First, going through the felt and the original hole
Next, bring the thread around the outside of the bracelet to and back up through the next hole. That way it still resembles the original baseball threading.
You will continue this until you have gone all the way around the bracelet, then tie to secure the thread.

, All you have left to do now is to decorate it, or if you choose not to, it looks cute without any decorations as well! Here, a couple Detroit old English D’s were drawn in permanent marker on this one and then jewel embellishments were used to outline the bracelet.

Choose a wooden candlestick.,
Choose a thick, wooden dowel that is about 10 to 12 inches (25.4 to 30.48 centimeters) long.,
Find the center of the dowel and mark it with a pen or pencil.,
Draw a line of glue across the top center of the candlestick.,
Press the dowel down into the glue.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Spray paint the bracelet holder.,
Spray the holder with an acrylic sealer and let it dry.,
Consider embellishing your holder.",How to Make a Bracelet Holder1," The type you can get from a dollar store or a craft store are ideal. It needs to be tall enough to hang your bracelets from., Try to find a dowel thick enough to cover the hole in your candlestick. You may need to cut it down to the right length.If you can't find a wooden dowel, stuff a rolled up magazine into a paper towel tube, and use that instead.

, Measure across the dowel with a ruler, and make a mark in the center. Don't worry, you don't see the mark once you are done painting.

, Make sure the line is going from side to side. The candle hole will interrupt your line. You can use wood glue, tacky glue, or an industrial strength glue for this.

, Make sure that the mark you made earlier is right in the middle of the candle hole. Try to center the dowel on top of the candlestick as much as possible. If you see any excess glue, wipe it off quickly with a damp paper towel.

, Once the glue dries, you can strengthen your holder by filling the seam between the dowel and the candlestick with more glue.

, Take the bracelet holder to a well-ventilated area and protect your work surface with newspaper. Shake a can of spray paint, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the coat to dry, then apply a second one, if necessary. Most spray paints will dry in 20 minutes to 2 hours.


It is better to apply your paint in many thin coats rather than one thick coat. This will give you a smoother finish and prevent any drips or puddles.
You can also prime your holder first using a spray on primer. Choose white for a light color, and black or grey for a dark color.

, Once the paint dries, shake a can of some acrylic sealer, hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the holder, and spray on a light, even coat. Wait for the sealer to dry, then apply a second coat. Avoid applying the sealer too thickly, or you will get drips and puddles. Most sealers will take about 2 hours to dry; some will also require a curing time, which will be specified on the can.


Choose a glossy finish if you want your holder to be shiny. Choose a matte finish if you don't want it to be shiny.

, Once your holder dries, it is ready to go. You can leave it as it is, or embellish it further to better match your room decor. You can use hot glue or super glue to attach these embellishments. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Glue a pretty button or bead to each end of the dowel. Try to choose a bead or button that is the same diameter.
Glue some small pearls, beads, or silk flowers around the top edge of the candlestick.
Glue a large bead or ornament on top of the holder, right in the center.
Wrap ribbon around the dowel in a spiral.

Cut two half circles into the top of the toilet paper tube.,
Hot glue the paper towel tube into the grooves.,
Hot glue the toilet paper tube onto the base.",How to Make a Bracelet Holder2," Place the paper towel tube right onto the tape, and use a marker to trace around it. These circles will cover the ends of your paper towel tube.

, Use the gun to draw a line of glue all the way around the top edge of the paper towel tube. Place the circle, tape side out, onto the glue. Wait for the glue to set, then repeat this step for the other side. Trim off any excess cardboard from the edges.

, Cut two 6 by 6 inch (15.24 by 15.24 centimeters) squares out of cardboard. Use hot glue to glue the two squares together. Make sure that the edges are aligned neatly. This will make your base.

, Be sure to cover the ends of the paper towel tube as well. Do not attach the pieces together just yet, however. You to cover them first before assembling them.


If you don't want to use duct tape, consider using fabric instead. You can also paint it using spray paint or acrylic paint, but the texture of the tubes will show through.

, The flat part of each half circle should be aligned with the top edge of the tube. The half circles will make the grooves for the paper towel tube to sit on., Draw a line of hot glue down each groove. Find the center of the paper towel tube, and press it right into the glue.


If you want to hide the seams between the top of the toilet paper tube and the sides of the paper towel tube, fold a long strip of duct tape over the top of the paper towel tube, and press the two ends down the sides of the toilet paper tube.

, Draw a thick line of hot glue around the bottom edge of the toilet paper tube. Find the center of the base, and stick it down.


If the glue is not strong enough, you may have to reinforce it with more duct tape.

",How to Make a Bracelet Holder3," The box can be plain, or it can be decorated. Craft stores sell many beautiful cardboard boxes that would be perfect for storing bracelets.

, You can make the box all one color, or use different colors for the inside and the outside. If you want to add designs to your box, paint the background color first, let it dry, then add the designs.


If your bracelets are delicate, consider covering the inside of your box with velvet.

, You will need these measurements to make your dividers.

, This will give you several long compartments for you to store your bracelets in. If you want a half-sided compartment, then cut several shorter pieces of cardboard to use as a divider between two compartments.

, You can match the color to the inside of the box, or use a contrasting color. Paint one side and let it dry first. Flip the pieces over, then paint the other side.


If you covered the inside of your box with velvet, then you might want to use velvet for this as well.

, Coat the bottom and side edges of a divider with liquid glue, and slide it into the box. It should fit snuggly. If it flops over, consider bracing it with a heavy object, such as a jar. If you need to reinforce the dividers, wait until the glue dries, then draw a line of glue between the seams.


If you are using shorter dividers: glue in all of the long/horizontal dividers first, then add in the short/vertical dividers.

, To add a tube, follow the directions below.


Cut the paper towel tube down until it is at least an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box.
Paint the tube, or cover it with velvet fabric.

Select the safety pins.,
Decorate each safety pin with the seed beads.,
Close the pin.,
Use pliers to squeeze the pins shut.,
Continue to decorate all 85 pins this same way.,
Notice that there is a hole in the pinhead and another hole at the other end of the safety pin where the metal is turned, creating a circle.,
Cut two lines of sheering elastic.,
Thread together.,
Continue adding pins to the lines in this way, alternating which way you add each pin.,
Finish off.,
Try the bracelet on.",How to Make a Bracelet out of Safety Pins," Decide how large you want the safety pins to be––obviously, the larger the pins, the larger the bracelet size. Small to medium size safety pins work best; whatever you choose, they must all be of the same size. Approximately 85 safety pins are needed to complete this project but you might need to add or remove a few depending on your wrist size––experiment as you go.









As well as the safety pins, select seed beads that are of a size suitable to fit inside the pin space. The colors are up to you––they could be all one color, a variation of the same hue or a rainbow of colors, depending on the final look you're after.;
, Open each pin and place a row of seed beads onto each safety pin. Make sure each pin has enough beads on it before closing.








, Use pliers to press down on the head of the safety pin to hold the pin firmly closed.








, Squeeze the metal where you locked the pins in place.








, Once they're all decorated and closed tightly, you can move on to threading.








, These holes will be used for threading up the pins.








, Two lines will be used, one at the top and below, with the pins threaded onto the elastic lines like the rungs of a ladder.








, To begin, thread the top line through the head of the first pin and the bottom line and through the circle hole. With the second pin, thread the top line through the circle hole and the bottom line and through the head of the pin.








, Make sure when you add the safety pins that all the beads are visible on the same side.








, When the last safety pin has been added, tie the two ends of the top line of sheering elastic together so that all the pins sit closely together. Then tie off the bottom line in a similar way. Make sure the knots are tight and stable.








, Stretch the elastic gently and slip over your hand and onto your wrist. The fit should be comfortable.

Choose the amount of string.,

Measure and cut the materials.,

Tie the strings together.,

Secure bracelet to a stable surface.,

Separate the strands.,

Make a left knot.,
Make a right knot.,
Begin knotting the bracelet.,
As you are knotting, these knots will begin to spiral around the bundle of strings.,

Switch colors when you're ready.,

Repeat this braiding process until your bracelet has reached the desired length.,Cut about 3 inches below the knot, so the strand lengths are all equivalent.,

Tie the result around your wrist and your bracelet is complete!
",How to Braid a Spiral Bracelet," When determining the amount of strands to use for a bracelet, consider how many colors you are using. Aim to use at least 2-4 strands per color, to ensure that one color will not run out before the rest.  As a general rule, each bracelet should use about 6 strands of floss. The more strands, the thicker the bracelet.
, After you have decided the color and amount of string to use, measure and cut each strand about 18 inches in length, or roughly the distance from your wrist to your shoulder. This will allow you to make a bracelet that is long enough to wrap around your wrist.

To speed up this process, use the first strand that was measured and cut as a basis for the rest of the string. Rather than measuring out 18 inches of each string, hold the previously cut strand to the remaining strings and cut them to be the same length.
The more complex the knotting system is, the longer the string should be due to extra knots at every row. Remember, it’s better to cut the string too long rather than too short.

, After cutting the strands, gather one end of each piece of string and bundle them together in your hand. Tie a knot approximately three inches below the ends of the string. This will give you plenty to work with when tying the finished product around your wrist., There are several ways to secure the bracelet. The simplest way is to tape the bracelet (above the knot) to a table or counter. However, if not taped well enough, the bracelet might slide out. Nonetheless, there are other options to consider:

 Safety pinning the bracelet through the knot and to a pillow, blanket or the pants that you are wearing is the best way to ensure that the bracelet will stay in position. 
You can also try clipping the bracelet to a clipboard, as this too will provide sufficient and stable control.

, Before starting the knotting process, separate each thread and make sure that none are knotted together. For this spiral bracelet, choose one strand of the color that you would like to begin with and pull it to the left side. This will be your active color. Group the remaining strands together and place them on the right side. These will be your inactive colors.

This step seems tedious and unnecessary when make a spiral bracelet, however, when making more advanced bracelets, this step will prove to be crucial in determining the color placement and string location.

, Hold the bundle of strands with your left hand. Take the active color in your right hand and starting from the left and moving right, pass it over the bundle of strings and loop it under and back through the opening. Pull up and to the left to tighten the knot.

To make this process easier, try using your left pointer finger as an aid. Stick out your left pointer finger and hook the active color on it, proceed to loop it under and through the center opening.
Make sure you are knotting over the bundle of strings, because knotting beneath them will result in a different type of knot.

, Switch the process above from the left knot above and use opposite hands. (Every time you see left, use your right hand and every time you are told to use right, use your left hand.), To make this spiral bracelet, it is just continual left knots using various colors. Use the active color to create a chain of knots of a desired length. Typically, 15 knots will be done with each color, but this amount can be adjusted based on your preference for the desired length of that color block., This is as expected, so with each knot, pull the string in the direction that the spiral is moving in. Since this bracelet is composed of strictly left knots, tightly pull the active color up and to the left.

If this bracelet is done with right knots instead, the spiral will be moving in the right direction instead.

, After the desired length has been reached, switch colors by putting the now inactive color back in the bundle of strands, and removing a new active color to begin knotting with.,

Once this length has been reached, tie a knot at the bottom of your completed bracelet pattern, to ensure that these knots will not unravel.

Fill a stapler with the staples of choice.,
Punch enough staples for the bracelet.,
Join the pressed staples.,
Tighten the loop.,
Add the next staple in the same way.,
Ask for someone else's help to loop the bracelet on.,
You're done!",How to Make a Bracelet Out of Staples," You can go with the usual plain silver colored staples or be a little more funky and choose staples in different colors (these can be found in some stationery stores).






;
, Do not punch the staples with force, as the loops will come out too small for you to work with. To know how many you'll probably need, estimate the width around your wrist as follows:









Measure your wrist with a measuring tape.
Place one pressed staple on the tape to see how long it is. Use this measurement to work out how many more of this length will meet your wrist length. Use the total to punch out staples, with a few spares, just in case.

, Link the first staple with the second by sliding them together between the loops.








, Press with your fingers, tweezers or fine jewelry pliers.








, Continue to make the pressed staple chain as big as you need it to fit your wrist.








, It can be a little tricky.









Alternatively, you could add a closure clasp finding to help the bracelet open and close, but this is tricky and requires skill––only suitable for those familiar with applying such clasps.

, Enjoy wearing your staple bracelet.

Apply glue to the barrette base.,
Line up the studs.,
Bend the prongs around the barrette.,
Coat the entire barrette with primer.,
Spray paint the barrette.,
Wear the barrette.",How to Make Hair Clips1," Draw a thin bead of tacky glue down the center of the barrette base.


Alternatively, you can lay a dot a glue directly beneath the estimated position of each stud. You'll need to line up the studs beside the base of the barrette to determine how many you'll use and how far apart to space the glue dots.;
, Arrange a line of pyramid-style studs over the barrette, lining them up so that the flat edges face one another. Press the back of each stud firmly into the applied adhesive, making sure it sticks, and use as many studs as needed to cover the full length of the barrette.Check the studs before lining them up. Ideally, the studs should be just a little wider than the width of the barrette.
Before arranging the studs, fold out the prongs of each stud so that they lie completely flat.
Wipe away any excess glue with a damp paper towel. Allow the glue to dry completely before continuing to the next step.

, After the glue dries, use pliers to bend the prongs of each stud around the barrette back.


Make sure that the prongs only bend around the backing and not around the clip portion of the barrette.
If the pressure you apply causes the glue to weaken and the stud to break away, reapply the glue as needed. Wipe away any excess glue and let it dry completely before continuing.

, Apply one or two coats of white spray primer to the front, back, and sides of the barrette. The studs must be completely coated, as well.


For best results, use a spray primer labeled for use with metal.
You'll usually need to wait at least 30 minutes in between coats, but each primer can be a little different, so you should check and follow the label instructions to be sure.

, Apply two to three coats of spray paint to the barrette. Choose any color you want and make sure that it covers the entire barrette, including the attached studs.


As with primer, you should use a spray paint approved for use with metal and follow the label instructions carefully. You will usually need to wait 30 minutes or so in between coats.
Allow the paint to dry completely before wearing or otherwise handling the barrette. The final wait time can be as much as double the wait time given in between coats.

, Once the paint is dry, the barrette is complete and ready to wear.

Cut a strip of washi tape.,
Apply the tape to the hair clip.,
Trim away the excess width.,
Fold over the front and back.,
Wear the hair clip.",How to Make Hair Clips2," Use scissors to cut a strip of any patterned washi tape. The strip of tape should be just a little longer than the length of the alligator clip.


Make sure that the tape is at least as wide as the width of the clip. You can still use washi tape that is wider than the clip, but you might have difficulty if the reverse is true.

, Carefully stick the piece of tape over the top of an alligator hair clip or other flat barrette.


Try to position the tape so that there is a little overhang beyond the front and back of the clip. Make sure that the entire width of the clip is covered, as well.
Run your thumb over the tape, applying even pressure, to help remove any air bubbles and flatten the tape.

, Use scissors to carefully trim away any excess tape along the width of the clip. Try to trim the tape as close to the clip as possible.


Do not worry about trimming away any excess tape from the lengthwise front and back of the clip.
If you cannot trim away the entire excess width, you can carefully press some of the width-wise edge onto the side of the clip. Make sure that the tape does not cover the teeth of the alligator clip, however.

, Carefully fold the excess tape hanging beyond the front and back over the edge and onto the back of the clip.


As you fold the tape, make sure that it doesn't stick to the teeth or the hinged portion of the clip.
Most alligator clips are rectangular, making it easy to fold the tape over the edge. If you end up using a hair clip with a round end, however, you will need to fold the tape more carefully. Fold the corners of the excess tape under as evenly as possible, then follow by folding the center of the excess tape in the same direction., The hair clip should now be done and ready to wear.

Double thread the needle.,
Feed the seed beads onto the needle and thread.,
Knot the opposite end.,
Slip the strand into the hair clip.,
Wear the clip.",How to Make Hair Clips3," Feed a length of all-purpose thread through the eye of a sewing needle. Double up the thread, then knot the end using a standard overhand knot.


The length of the thread will vary based on individual preference. Keep in mind that the finished length of your bead chain on the hair clip will be half the total length of the stand itself.
Double up the thread, keeping it bent over the eye of the needle, and knot both ends together at the opposite end. Trim away any excess thread beyond the knot.

, Thread seed beads onto the strand by sliding them over the needle and down the length of the thread.


You'll need to choose seed beads that have a wide enough opening to fit over the sewing needle. The opening must be too small to fit over the knot at the end of your thread, however.
Use any color or mix of colors you'd like for this project. You can create patterns or thread the beads randomly.
Continue threading beads until nearly the entire length of thread has been covered. Make sure that you leave enough thread at the top of the strand to knot off, though.

, Tie a standard overhand knot above the top bead of your strand. Position the knot as close to the top bead as possible, and make sure this knot is large enough to block the beads from falling off.


Trim away any excess thread beyond this top knot.
Note that both ends should be knotted at the completion of this step.

, Open the clip and slide the beaded strand inside. The center of the bead chain should should be aligned with the fold of the open hair clip.


Snap clips work best for this project since you can fit the strand of beads directly around the bottom snap prong of the clip. Make sure that the ends of the strand extend outward through the front opening of the clip.
If desired, you can knot or glue the stand of beads together at the base of the hair clip. Doing so shouldn't be necessary in most cases, however, and the beads should remain firmly in place even without the use of adhesive.

, The hair clip should be done and ready to wear. Fit it into your hair so that the ends of the beaded strand hang down.

Trim the feathers.,
Glue the feathers to the felt.,
Wear the hair clip.",How to Make Hair Clips4," Lay a small scrap of felt over the top of any flat hair clip. Trim the felt so that it roughly matches the length and width of the clip.


Alligator clips, blank barrettes, and snap clips will all work for this project. The clip you choose simply needs to have a flat top. It will also be easier to work with if it is at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) long.
As you trim the felt, try to match the shape and dimensions of the clip as closely as possible. The felt should completely cover the top of the clip. It can overhang a little on all sides, but not by more than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).

, Apply a thin line of hot glue over the top of the hair clip. Gently press the felt onto the glue.


Only apply glue to the top surface of the clip. Do not allow any of the glue to drip onto the hinged bottom portion.
Make sure that the felt is centered over the hair clip. Use your thumb to quickly smooth out any wrinkles or bumps, then allow the glue to dry before handling the clip further.

, Use scissors to trim the tips off approximately one dozen clean craft feathers. The length of each trimmed portion should be roughly one-fourth to one-third the total length of your felt strip.


You can experiment with different feathers and felt, but as a general rule, this hair clip will look best when you use one type/color of feather. Pair it with felt that roughly matches the same color.

, Layer the snipped feather pieces over the felt strip. Glue each feather piece onto the felt by apply a dot of hot glue to the base.


Start your way at the top of the clip and gradually work your way down. Each horizontal layer should consist of two or three feather pieces, and the feathers should slightly overlap one another, hiding most of the felt from view.
Only apply a small dot of glue to the base of each feather piece before sticking it onto the felt. The top and side of each feather should remain fairly loose and free.

, Once all of the glue cools and dries, the hair clip should be ready to wear.

If your headband is too loose, cut off more ribbon and sew it to the end of the elastic. The elastic will typically be hidden under your hair, so it won't be a problem to have a bit more of the stretchy material.
Avoid ribbon or trim with sequins sewn in, as they may get caught in your hair and cause a difficult tangle.;
, Hard-shell headbands are available for incredibly cheap, at several for a dollar at many stores. They're cheap for a reason though: they're plain. Grab a couple in a color you like, and decorate away! Wrap them in ribbon, spray-paint them, glue on beads or sequins, or add feathers. The sky's the limit when it comes to decorating these bad boys. Plus, because they're cheap you don't have to worry about ruining one and not being able to make a new one. 








Use found items or pieces off of old headbands or jewelry in order to be environmentally friendly and frugal.

, This is a great option for combining fashion with utility. Purchase two 2"" thick jersey headbands from any beauty supply store. Cut one of the headbands in half along the seam. Place the cut headband through the complete headband, and then sew the ends back together (so you are left with two loops linked together). Pull the loops tight and then sew the opposite ends of the loops together to create a single loop, with a knot at the front where the two headbands meet.








If you'd rather not buy and butcher two perfectly good headbands, any jersey fabric cut into strips will work. You can also choose to use old nylons for the same effect.
You can hand-sew or use a sewing machine for this project.

, Braid from the knot down the length of the yarn.

, This length can be ascertained from the length of the clip, barrette or other hair accessory you're going to be adding the design to.

, This will prevent the braid from unraveling. The braid piece is now ready to be attached to the hair accessory.

, If it isn't clean, remove any dust or grime first, and allow to fully dry before proceeding.

, Add glue to the accessory's surface first, then align the piece of braid to the surface. In some cases, you may find that it also helps to add the glue to the braid as well as to the surface of the hair accessory.


Be sure to use glue that is suitable for both the yarn (fabric) and for the hair accessory.

,, This might be a spray-on varnish or a brush of Mod Podge. This is to protect the surface from wear and tear.

Upcycle a hair clip.",How to Make Hair Accessories2," Typically the goal of bobby pins is to secretly pin back hair - but why not give them a bit of flair and wear them more noticeably? Put 5-10 bobby pins together over a thick piece of cardstock (fold it in half if need be), and slide them so that they're all touching. Use nail polish or acrylic paint to coat the bobby pins with a design or a solid color. Allow them to dry, and you're done! Wear multiple together for a unique look, or use one at a time for a pop of color.







, This is a great way to look cheap bobby pins look very fancy. Gather 10-20 beads of your choice, with a hole large enough that small craft







, Choose your favorite fabric - you won't need more than a piece 4 inches (10.2 cm) wide - and cut it into two pieces: one piece three times as wide as the other. Wrap the wider piece around to create a loop, and glue the ends together. . Use the second thin strip to create a 'knot' at the center by wrapping it around the loop in the middle. Glue the ends together at the back. You should be left with a small bow which can be attached to your favorite hair clip.







, Find a small piece of leather (or faux-leather) and cut it in a rectangle slightly larger than your hair clip. Pick some studs that are slightly smaller than the leather strip, and arrange them as you like. Attach them to the leather either using the brad on the back (if they have them) or with a dab of hot glue. Glue this studded leather strip to your hair clip to finish up the project.







, Find a collection of small items such as buttons, fabric flowers, beads, and broken pieces of jewelry. Attach these pieces to hair clips with hot glue or wire. Keep your hair clip simple by adding a single item to a single clip, or go for glam and stack up multiple items on a clip. You'll have a 100% unique and green hair clip!

Wrap the ribbon in a spiral around the dowel. Secure both ends of the ribbon to the dowel with wooden clothespins.#* The edges of the ribbon can touch, but don't let them overlap. The closer together the wraps are, the tighter your curls will be. The further apart they are, the looser the curls will be.Choose a dowel that is about 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long.. This ensures that it will fit on your baking sheet.

, This will give you a nice, full korker bow.For an extra-full bow, you could make 6 more dowels. You can use the same color of ribbon for each dowel, or experiment with different colors and patterns.

, Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Set the dowels down onto the baking sheet. Don't let the ribbon part touch the sheet, or the ribbon may scorch.


Some people find that dampening the ribbons with water helps the ribbons hold their curl better., As the ribbons bake, they will conform to the shape of the dowel, and hold their curl. If you want crisper curls, spray the ribbons with clothing starch just after you take them out of the oven., Pull off the clothespins first. In most cases, you should be able to slide the curls off of the dowels. If you can't, carefully unwind them. The ribbons should spring back into shape.

, Cut them at angles by keeping your scissors parallel to the ribbons. This way, the ends of the ribbon will be angled and not stick out randomly. You want a total of 30 to 36 curls., This will help prevent fraying. The easiest way to do this is to hold the ends over a flame for a few seconds. If you are nervous around fire, you can use fray check instead.


Use a tea light or a pillar candle as your flame source. They are sturdy and less likely to tip over.
Keep a bowl or cup of water nearby in case of accidents.

, Something between 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) long would be ideal.Orient the elastic horizontally.


If you can't find thin elastic, a piece of string or thread would also do.

, Orient them vertically so that they lay across the elastic. You can pile them in whatever order you want, but make sure that they are even on both ends.

, Pull both ends of the elastic together, then overlap them and tie them into a tight knot. The ribbon curls will gather in the center, and flare out at the ends.

, There is a chance that some ends of the ribbons ended up shorter/longer than others. If this happened, gently tug on the shorter ends until they are all the same length., The square knot is very similar to a double knot, but instead of doing the same knot twice, you reverse it. Cross the left elastic over the right, and tie it into a knot. Cross the right elastic over the left, and tie it into a second knot., The ribbon needs to be twice the length of your clip, plus an extra 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). You will be covering the top of your clip, then folding the rest of the ribbon instead. The excess ribbon will cover the clasp. You can use any color of ribbon you want for this, but it needs to be the same width as your clip., While not completely necessary, this will help keep your ribbon from fraying. Hold one end of the ribbon over a flame until the end melts. Repeat for the other end. , Turn your clip so that the top is facing away from you. Pinch the clip open. Run a line of hot glue along the underside of the top piece. Quickly press the ribbon into the glue.

, Turn your clip so that the top is facing you. Run a line of hot glue along the top piece. Press the ribbon into the glue.

, Turn the clip so that the bottom is facing you. Place a dot of glue on the bottom edge, on the same side that the clasp is on. Fold the ribbon over the clasp and press the end into the glue. This will cover the clasp on the back of the clip.If there is any ribbon that did not get glued down, secure it with more hot glue.

, Make a small mound of hot glue in the center of your clip. Find the side of your bow with the square knot, and press it into the glue."

Wrap your working strings tightly around both your hair and the other six strings.,
Switch working strings when you want to start a section with a new color.,
Incorporate beads and charms.,
Attach a feather to the bottom of the wrap.,
Finish your hair wrap by knotting all strings at the bottom.,
Cut your hair wrap at its base when you're done wearing it.",How to Do a Hair Wrap," A few different bright colors will give you the best results. You can use up to four different colors.


You can select a set of colors to create an ombré effect. If you pick colors that are a similar hue but with different shades, you can fade from one to the other. You can also go from one hue to another that's next to it on the color wheel, for example yellow to orange.Other types of string, such as yarn, can work for hair wraps. Just make sure whatever material you're working with is colorfast. You don't want the dye to run the next time you shampoo your hair. It should also be fairly thin to keep your hair wrap from being too bulky.;
, Thinner braids work better for hair wraps than thicker ones. Make sure your braid is very tight.


Picking a strand closer to your face will have a bigger impact than one further back.
If your hair doesn't hold braids well, you can secure it with a small hair tie at the bottom.If you already have your hair in braids or dreadlocks, you can add a splash of color by selecting one or more strands to wrap individually.

, You will need four separate strings that are roughly two- to-three times the length of your hair.


Remember that it's much better to start with too much thread than too little. You can always trim off the excess at the end, but you can't add length to string that's too short.

, You can always position the knot lower on the braid if you want your hair wrap to start further down.Overhand knots are the simplest knot you can tie:


Make sure all four strings are parallel and bunched together so they can be treated as a single string.
Loop the strings behind the top of the braid. Make sure that your braid is positioned in the center of the strings so that each end is equal.
Take the right end and loop it back around the braid to the left. Start by crossing over the front of the braid and pull the end under and through the loop back towards the right.
Pull both ends in opposite directions to tighten. Make sure your knot is very tight when making a hair wrap.Once the knot is complete, each string you started with will be divided in half. Before starting your wrap in earnest, you'll have twice as many strings to work with. For example, if you began with four strings, you should now have eight individual strands hanging from the base of your wrap.

, These will be your ""working strings."" Lay the remaining six strings (if you started with four) flat along the braid. Keep them taught by holding both the strings and your braid in your non-dominant hand., Keep going, moving down the braid as you wrap. Be sure to leave at least an inch or two on your working string to help your wrap's stability.


One technique to ensure a tight wrap is to do four wraps around, push these wraps up, and repeat., Whether your working strings are getting short or you simply want to move on to the next color, you'll swap strings multiple times while making your hair wrap. Simply add your working strings to the other six and pick out two new strings of the same color.


When using two colors, you can make a striking pattern of alternating stripes. Try to make the stripes all one width for a well-crafted look.
One very popular style of hair wrap is the ombré look, which is an effect where multiple similar colors are lined up to create a gradient from one color to another similar color. Examples would be light blue to dark blue, intense magenta to pale pink, and yellow to orange. If you're making an ombré wrap, start with your first color and wrap about a quarter of your braid. Switch to the second color that most closely matches the first. Repeat with the last two colors, ending with the color that contrasts the most with your starting color., This step is totally optional. Most hair wraps don't have any embellishments. If you want to add some, however, it's very easy to do:


Pick a bead or some other small object that can be threaded onto a string, such as a charm. Keep in mind that your hair wrap is likely to get wet, so don't choose anything made of metals that are easily corroded (rust or turn green).
At any point while wrapping your hair, string the bead through your working strings. Push it up so it's positioned at the bottom of your wrap.
Simply continue wrapping once the bead is in place.

, This is another optional step that adds a little flair to your hair wrap. Once you're almost to the bottom of your braid with about an inch of hair left, line up a feather's quill with your braid and the remaining strings. Continue your wrap, this time including the feather's quill.


If you used a hair tie to hold the ends, you can slide the quill under the hair tie to hold it in place., Tie tight knots of your choice to keep your wrap from unraveling. You may choose to tie a double or triple knot for added durability. If there is any excess loose string after you tie your knot, trim it off with your scissors., If you made your wrap well, it is unlikely to fall out on its own. The most common way to remove a hair wrap is to simply remove the entire lock of hair.


Some people keep their wrapped lock of hair as a memento.
If you don't want to lose that strand of hair, you can try removing the hair wrap by cutting the knots at the end and unraveling it by hand. Keep in mind this will take much longer than a simple trim.
The more tightly you wind your wrap, the longer it will stay looking great. The average amount of time it takes a wrap to start seeming shabby is three weeks.If you avoid soaking it when washing your hair, your wrap will last longer.

For a bunchier scrunchie, plan to make your tube longer.
For a puffier scrunchie, you can extend the length of the chain stitch recommended here.;
, Different types of yarn produce very different textures.


Fun fur yarn and chenille are playful choices for children and the young at heart.
Mercerized cotton has a sleek effect for a more classic hair accessory.
Choose ribbon yarn for a sporty style.
Note that textured yarns are generally more difficult to work with than plain or smooth yarns.

, Scrunchies can be obvious or subtle depending on the color and texture. Tones that contrast with the hair color stand out, while those that blend are less likely to draw attention to themselves.


Bright colors like pink, purple, or yellow are a cheerful choice, while darker colors like navy and black work better with more neutral or classic styles.

, You can by a crochet needle, yarn, and knitting needle at a craft store or online.


Hair bands without the metal joiner tend to last longer than those that have them. You can purchase these at a drugstore or beauty supply store. Some craft stores may also carry them.

, Do this about 6 inches (15 cm) from the end of the yarn.


Make a loop with the yarn. The free end (i.e., the end that does not lead to the ball of yarn) should pass behind the loop.
Insert the crochet hook through the loop, hooking the free end.
Pull the hooked yarn forward (towards you) through the loop and then upwards into the hook's working area.Hold the base of the slipknot with your forefinger and pull the free end to tighten.
The loop should be firm but not too tight; it should easily slide back and forth along the hook.
Check that you have 6 inches (15 cm) left on the free end.

, Note that you might need to make this longer if you want a scrunchie with a wider tube.


Start your chain stitch with a yarn over (passing the yarn over from behind the hook).
Use the hook end to draw this yarn through the loop on the yarn. Now you have your first chain stitch.
Repeat this step nine to eleven more times.,

Yarn over twice. In other words, wrap the yarn around your hook twice before pushing the hook through the work.
Push the hook through.

, Work a slip stitch from your current stitch to the third chain stitch from Step 4 to form a round.

, You will notice that you are making a tube that encases the hair band. The tube will follow the hair band around into a circle.

, Your last round should reach the bottom of your base round without stretching. You may be tempted to cheat, but this will result in a scrunchie that looks small and flat rather than full and ruffled.


When you are done, it is time to join the two ends into a doughnut shape.

, You're going to use this yarn to sew up the edges.


Thread a blunt knitting needle onto the end of the yarn and sew the two edges together. Make sure that the stitches on both rounds line up so that you get a smooth join.
Tie a knot in the end of the yarn and break it off. Leave about 4 inches (10 cm) of yarn.

, You can do this with the yarn needle or the hook.

",How to Make a Hair Stick from a Knitting Needle," Hair sticks can vary in length quite significantly and the length of your hair stick will depend on the length and thickness of your hair, and the style you will use it for. As a rough guide, measure the width of your bun and add an inch, or two if you plan to use the stick for buns, or add three to four inches if you plan on using it for styles where your hair is wrapped around the stick. This is easier if you have someone to measure it for you!;
,, If you have a vice this can be used to hold the knitting needle in place while you cut, however, it isn't necessary. You can hold the needle by hand, or with a pair of pliers. If you use something to hold the knitting needle while you cut it, wrap the needle in a cloth or paper towel to avoid damaging the coating.

, If your knitting needle is made from wood, then sandpaper will work best; if it is made from metal, then a metal file is the best tool for the job.

, If the bead cap comes down around the top of the needle it will help to prevent the decorative top being knocked off during everyday use.

,,,, This can be done most easily by putting the pin inside the nozzle of the tube of glue.

Store your earrings.",How to Make Your Own Earrings," Take a quick trip to the craft store to gather a few basic items for creating your own earrings. There are a few standard tools you'll need to create the earrings themselves, but you can be as creative as you like when it comes to decorating the earrings. Here are the things you'll need:


Earring hooks
Cleaning alcohol
Glue, or a hot glue-gun
Toothpicks
Thin wire
Small pliers
Aluminum foil
Anything else you'd like to use to dress up your earrings, such as paint, stickers, small bows, glitter, or jewels;
, Carefully wipe down the hooks with the disinfectant. You'll need to take this precaution before you begin to wear the earrings.

, Use the foil to create a small and visually appealing shape for your earrings. The ball works best and is the easiest to make. Use only a small square of foil about the size of your palm to make these balls. If they're too big, the earrings may be too heavy and can hurt your ears.

, You can decorate the earrings any way you like. You can roll them in glue and them roll them in glitter. You can also put tiny stickers or sticky jewels on them. You can use glue to stick other small decorations on them, such as tiny fuzzy balls. You can also cover the earrings with paint and then add decorations, or just leave them painted a nice, appealing color.


If you're using glue to decorate the earrings, give them time to dry before moving on to the next step.

, Use a toothpick or a long pin to make a hole right through the center of each earring. Just position it at the top center of the earring and gently push it down until it goes all the way through.

, Use pliers or wire cutters to cut two pieces of wire for your earrings. This wire will hang off the earring hooks and will attach to your earrings, so you can make each piece as long as you want. For dangly earrings, you can cut the wire even longer. If you want the earrings to hang close to your earlobes, then cut the pieces a bit shorter.


Gently curl up one end of each piece of wire until it curves back into itself. You'll need this shape to hold up the earring.

, Hold the curled part of the wire and push the straight part through the hole you've created in the earring. Once you've pushed it all the way through, curl it around the small hole at the base of the earring hook so that it attaches to the earring hook while firmly holding the earring in place.

, Simply repeat the steps you took to connect the earring, wire, and hook in the previous step until you have two perfect earrings.

, If you don't want to wear the earrings right away, you can store them in a box to use them later, or to present them to a friend. You can even make your own hand-made box to continue the home-made theme.

If you aren’t sure how to pair your studs, purchase a set that includes several pairs. They’ll likely coordinate with one another easily.
You may want to choose a common theme for your studs. For example, you might wear several pairs of different star- or heart-shaped studs.;
, If you want your stacked earrings to be a little more eye-catching, add a pair or two of hoops to your studs. It’s best to choose small, delicate-looking hoops so they complement the studs.Like studs, hoop earrings have a more casual look. They pair well with relaxed outfits, such as a tee shirts and jeans.
You can wear the hoops anywhere on your ear. For example, you might place one pair on the lobe and add another to the cartilage at the top of your ear.
If you prefer, you can use all hoop earrings in your stacked look.

, For the boldest stacked earring look, work a dangling style into your arrangement. Dangling earrings look best when worn in your first lobe piercing, so pair them with studs and hoops in your other piercings.Dangling earrings are an ideal choice when you want your stacked earring look to have a more glamorous feel. For example, add some dangling earrings when you're wearing a gown or other formal dress for a special occasion.
The longer your dangling earrings are, the more dramatic your stacked earring look will be.

, When you’re pairing studs, hoops, and/or dangling earrings, it’s usually easier to create a flattering stacked look with earrings that are similar. Stick to all silver, gold, rose gold, enamel, or another material for your earrings so they are more likely to complement one another.You can also use common gemstones to create a cohesive look for your stacked earrings. For example, you might wear studs that all feature rhinestones or pearls.

, While choosing earrings that are all the same metal or feature the same gemstones is the easiest way to put together a stacked look, feel free to be creative. Combine gold and silver earrings or rhinestones and pearls for an eclectic, artsy look.If you’re not sure how to mix metals or gemstones, start with several pairs of earrings in a single metal or gemstone and add just one contrasting pair. For example, go with all silver earrings and add a single pair of gold hoops for your cartilage.
Pair earrings with different gemstones in the same metal. For example, you might wear a pair of gold studs with an emerald colored stone with gold studs with a sapphire colored stone.
Pair earrings in different metals with the same gemstone. For example, you might wear a pair of silver studs with rhinestones with gold studs with rhinestones.

, When you’ve stacked your earrings, you want to show them off. It’s best to wear a pulled back hairstyle that keeps your ears visible so the earrings are a major part of your outfit.A simple ponytail or bun is an ideal hairstyle when you’re wearing stacked earrings.
If you don’t want to put all of your hair up, consider going for a half up half down style. Pull just the hair from the sides of your face back with a clip, bobby pins, or hair elastic so your ears are fully visible.

, When you’re wearing stacked earrings, opt for a shirt or blouse with a higher neckline. That will draw attention up toward your face and ears so your earrings will get plenty of attention.A turtleneck or mock neck top is ideal for pairing with stacked earrings.

, A simple crew or boat neck top has a softer look than a high neckline because a crew neck hits at the base of the neck and a boat neck usually hits at the collarbone. Either option will still draw the eye upward, though, so it will complement your earrings.You can find dresses, sweaters, blouses, and tee shirts with a crew or boat neck, so you can go for as casual or as polished a look with your earrings as you like.

, With stacked earrings, it’s best not to wear too much other jewelry to compete with them. You may want to skip any type of necklace entirely, and limit your rings and bracelets to just one or two, so the earrings are the main focus of your look.If want to wear a necklace with your earrings, opt for a delicate style with a thin chain and small pendant.
While it’s best to limit your other jewelry, it can be a fun look to stack rings on your fingers to mimic the look of the earrings. You can wear several rings on one finger or spread out several rings among multiple fingers.

, The most common ear piercing is on the lobe. When you want to stack earrings, though, you’ll need more than one lobe piercing. In most cases, that means piercing the upper portion of the lobe as well so you can fit as many as three to four earrings on at a time.With lobe piercings, you can wear virtually any type of earrings, including studs, hoops, and dangling styles.

, A helix piercing occurs in the cartilage in the outer rim of the ear, usually near the top. You can wear studs or hoops in the piercing.A helix piercing usually takes between 8 and 16 weeks to heal.

, The auricle is the middle portion of the outer rim of the ear. Piercing this area allows you to stack a hoop or stud earring with whatever earrings you may be wearing on your lobes.If you’re thinking about getting an auricle piercing, keep in mind that it can be very painful and may require 8 to 12 weeks to heal.

, If you pierce your tragus, you can wear a stud or hoop in the oval shaped cartilage that sticks out in front of your ear canal. With an anti-tragus piercing, you can wear a barbell in the cartilage outside the ear and opposite the tragus.A tragus piercing typically requires 8 to 16 weeks to heal.
An anti-tragus piercing may not be possible in all individuals because the anti-tragus is often too small to pierce. It usually takes 8 to 16 weeks to heal.

, A conch piercing occurs on the cartilage above the lobe and anti-tragus but on the inside of the ear. You can wear a ring or barbell in this type of piercing.A conch piercing can take between 8 and 16 weeks to heal, and typically hurts as much as cartilage piercings.

, If you don’t want to commit to more than an earlobe piercing or two, you can find faux ear piercing jewelry that allows you to stack earrings in a variety of ways. You can usually find them at stores or online shops that specialize in accessories and inexpensive jewelry.

You can find jewelry designed to fake cartilage, conch, and tragus piercings.

Get some bobby pins, and slide them over the top of a sheet of paper.,
Paint the top of your bobby pins using a single stroke.,
Wait for the nail polish to dry, then add a second coat of nail polish, if needed.,
Add a clear top coat to protect your work, if desired.,
Wait for the nail polish to dry overnight.Nail polish may feel dry to the touch in under an hour, but it might still be soft underneath.,
Carefully take the bobby pins off of the paper.",How to Dress Up Bobby Pins1," Thicker paper, such as cardstock or an index card would work best for this, but you can use plain printer paper too. If you plan on painting several bobby pins the same color, consider separating them into small groups based on the color you will be painting them.


If you want to create a ""color blocked"" look, get some black bobby pins, and lay down strips of tape over them at various angles.;
, Don't worry if the nail polish looks see-though in places; you can always add another coat or two. You can paint either the flat side or the bumpy side—whichever one you plan on wearing on top!


The bobby pins don't have to be all one color. You could even paint stripes!
To create sparkly bobby pins, use either glitter nail polish, or shake some fine, scrapbooking glitter onto the nail polish instead., Some shades of nail polish only need one coat, while others may require up to three., This may not be necessary for regular nail polish, but if you added any glitter, it would be a good idea. If you'd like a twist, you can use glitter nail polish or a ""matte"" top coat instead.

, To prevent any chips or dents, wait for the nail polish to dry completely.


If you color blocked your bobby pins, carefully peel the tape off after the nail polish dries.

, You may notice bits of paper or excess nail polish sticking to the bobby pins. If this happens, simply scratch the paper/nail polish off with your fingernail."

Get a coat button that you find pretty or interesting.,
Turn the bobby pin over so that the side you plan on wearing outward is facing you.,
Slip the button over the tip of the bobby pin.,
Slide the button all the way down to the other end of the bobby pin.,
Secure the button with a drop or two of hot glue or super glue.,
Let the glue dry completely before you wear the bobby pin.",How to Dress Up Bobby Pins2," The loop or shank on the back of the button needs to be big enough for one of the prongs on the bobby pin to slide through., Wearing the bumpy side against your head will give you a better grip, but you can wear the bobby pin with the bumpy side facing out., Make sure that the top of the button is facing you., Do not let the button settle into the curve. You want it to be facing up, and resting against the flat/bumpy side of the bobby pin.

, This will keep the button from wobbling around too much. Simply put a line of glue along the bobby pin where the button will cover it. Then, press the button down, and wait for the glue to set.If the button is hallow, add a drop or two of glue into the loop/shank part of the button instead.

, If you used hot glue, your bobby pin will be ready to wear as soon as the glue sets; this usually only takes a few minutes. If you used super glue, this may take a little bit longer.

Slid your bobby pin(s) partway onto an index card.Leave about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) sticking out over the edge.,
Make sure that the side you want to decorate is facing up.,
Choose something to glue to your bobby pin.,
Place a drop of glue onto the back of the gem.The best glue to use for this would be an industrial-strength glue, super glue, or epoxy glue.,
Press the gemstone onto the bobby pin.It would be best if you pres it against the flat/bumpy side, and not the curved/looped part of the bobby pin.,
Wait for the glue to dry.,
Take the bobby pin off the paper.",How to Dress Up Bobby Pins3," This way, you won't risk accidentally gluing your bobby pin to the paper. The paper will help keep the bobby pin from rolling around while the glue dries.


If you can't find and index card, a piece of cardstock or even ordinary printer paper will do.

, The flat side of the bobby pin is technically the top, but many people like to wear bobby pins with the bumpy side facing out. Choose a side to work on, then set your sheet of paper with the bobby pin on it down.

, Gemstones and rhinestones are popular, but you can also use other small items, such as: cabochons, vintage earrings, flat buttons, fabric flowers, and so forth. Whatever you choose to use, make sure that it is small or lightweight. A large, fabric flower should not be a problem, but if you are going to use something heavy (like an earring or cabochon), choose something that is ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) or smaller.


If you are using a vintage earring, use a pair of wire cutters to cut the post off.
Create your own design! Glue a cabochon to a filigree button, or glue a few beads together to make a flower.

, Ordinary craft glue is not recommended, because it is not strong enough. Hot glue may work in a pinch, but your gemstone may break off.

, This way, your gemstone will be less likely to fall off. If you really want to, however, you can glue your decoration to the very tip, but be aware that it may break off.

, How long you wait will depend on the type of glue you are using. Super glue may dry in just a few minutes, while an industrial-strength glue may take up to several hours. Read the label on your glue for specific drying times.

, At this point, your bobby pin is now ready to wear! If the gemstone you added is still loose, consider cutting a small scrap of fabric, and then gluing it to the back of the gemstone. This will help anchor the gemstone to the bobby pin.

Cut a 10-inch (cc-centimeter) long piece of thin beading wire.,
Slip the wire part-way through the bend in your bobby pin.,
Twist the wire shut, then snip off the shorter piece of wire.,

Wrap the wire around the bumpy part of the bobby pin.,
Thread another bead onto the wire, and wrap it through the bobby pin again.,
Keep adding beads and wrapping the wire until you are one bead's width from the end of the bobby in.,
Wrap the wire a few times around the tip of the bobby pin without adding any beads.,
Pass the wire back through or under 2 to 3 beads, then snip it off.",How to Dress Up Bobby Pins4," Make sure that the wire is thin enough to go through your bead.

, Bring the wire 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of the way through the looped part of the bobby pin.

, Twist the wire only 2 to 3 times. Next, use a pair of wire cutters to snip the stub off as close to the twists as possible.

, Move the bead to the bumpy side of the bobby pin. This is technically the underside of the bobby pin, but the grooves will give the beads and the wires something to hold on to.

, You may have to push the bobby pin open so that you can get the wire between the two prongs. Do not wrap the wire around both prongs, or you won't be able to use the bobby pin.


The bead may start to shift as you wrap the wire. If this starts to happen, use your fingers to hold the bead in place.

, Give the wire a gentle tug first, then thread the bead onto it. Hold the bead in place as you wrap the bead through the bobby pin once more.

, How many beads you use will depend on the side of your bobby pin as well as the size of the of the beads. The smaller the beads are, the more beads you will need.


The beads can be different colors, but they should all be the same shape and size.

, Wrap the wire about three times, as tightly as you can. This will seal your beadwork shut.

, If the beads have large enough holes, you can wrap the wire back through the beads and under the bobby pin prong. If the holes are too small, simply pull the wire under three beads (keep it between the beads and the top of the bobby pin). Snip the excess wire off with a pair of wire cutters.


For added security, add a drop of glue under the wrapped wire at the tip of your bobby pin. Use jewelry glue; it dries clear and is suitable for metal.

Gather your supplies.,
Slide your silver bead on the headpin.,
Thread your crystal beads onto the headpins.,
Form a loop with the headpin.,
Slide your snowmen onto the silver earwires.,
Add scarves to your snowmen.",How to Make Snowman Earrings1," Some of the supplies you’ll need, like the crystal encrusted beads, the headpins, and the earwires with mirror beads, probably aren’t going to be lying around your home. Some craft stores will have everything you need, particularly any craft stores with large jewelry-making sections. If you’re unable to find these items in store, you can order everything you need online.
, Headpins are common in jewelry-making, and are used often in making earrings.The silver seed bead is a basic, small bead. By sliding it onto the headpin first, it will work as a little stopper to make sure that the bigger crystal beads stay on the headpin. Put one silver bead on each headpin., First, slide on the larger bead. This will be the base, or body, of the snowman. Then, slide the smaller bead, which will be the head. Your snowman has already taken shape, but you’re not done yet!, After you’ve threaded your crystal beads, you don’t need all of that excess space on the headpin. Now, you will need your pliers to create a loop with the wire. First, bend the wire into a right angle close to the top of your beads.Then, above where you created that fold in the wire, bend it so that it creates a loop. You can hold the wire above the fold with your pliers, and use your fingers to bend the wire around them.
Once you’ve created that loop, close it off by wrapping the wire around itself, where you created the original fold.
Once you’ve wrapped the wire several times and you’ve ensured that it’s secure, trim any excess wire with your wire cutters. Press the end of the wire down with the pliers so that it isn’t poking out.

, To do this, you will need to open up the small loop at the end of the earwire. It’s easiest to do this with your round nose pliers. Gently pull the loop of the earwire until it’s open enough to slide on the loop you created with your twisted headpin. Then, bend the loop of the earwire back, so that there are two closed loops that are connected. Take your time to make sure the loop of the earwire is completely closed and secure., Your earrings are almost finished, but there’s one little detail that can take them to the next level. Using a bit of red ribbon – or any color you like – you’re going to create little scarves around the snowmen's necks. Wrap the ribbon between the two crystal beads, and secure it with a knot. Then, trim the excess ribbon with your scissors. You can keep the ends of the scarves as long or short as you like.If your ribbon is wide, you may want to cut it into thinner strips so that the scarf isn’t too big for the tiny snowmen.
If your ribbon is fraying, paint a bit of clear nail polish along the tips.

Roll four small balls of clay.,
Put the balls in pairs and gently press them down.,
Create strands of red, white, and green clay.,
Twist and cut the strands.,
Create the hats of the snowmen.,
Add the final details.,
Bake your clay snowmen.,
Glue your earring backs to the snowmen.",How to Make Snowman Earrings2," Break off four sections of your white polymer clay, all of the exact same size. On a flat, clean surface, roll these pieces into small balls using your fingertips. These are going to form the body of the snowman. Because these are going to be stud earrings on your earlobes, make sure not to make the balls too large.

You can find polymer clay at your local craft store or online.

, Once you’re satisfied with the size of the balls, lay them flat in two pairs. Gently press down on the balls so that the backs of the balls flatten against the surface. You should now have two figures, each made of two of the white balls.The two white balls are the body and head of the snowman.
If you want to create your earrings so that the head of the snowman is smaller than the body, simply make two of the polymer clay balls smaller. Note, however, that this will make the craft a bit more difficult. You will have less surface area to create the face of the snowman.

, Take sections of each color and roll them against the flat surface you are working on. As you roll them between your palm and the surface, move from side to side so that the clay starts elongating. You want to end up with three long strands of clay, about the width of a piece of yarn.These don’t need to be very long – a couple of inches is plenty., Once you have three even strands, pick them up together and twist them in one direction. The strands should begin coiling around each other. Once you’ve twisted the entire length of the strands, lay it on the surface. Gently press it down flat, just as you did with the white balls.As you press down, the three different colored strands should start to meld together, so they look like one cohesive strand, rather than three strands twisted around each other.
Trim the finished strand into two pieces the same width as the white balls. Place it between the two balls, creating little scarves between the body and head of the snowmen.

, Gently roll two bits of white clay into thin strips, the same width as the white balls. Press this into the “head” of the snowmen. This strip is the fur-lining of the Santa hat. Create triangles from the red clay, and gently press those on top of the white strips. Add a tiny little ball of white clay on top of the red triangle (the puff ball of the Santa hat) and you’re all set!, Once the bodies, scarves, and hats of your two snowmen are completed, you just need to add the details. Press two tiny dots of black clay into the top white ball to create eyes. Add a larger red dot for a nose. Finally, add two red buttons down the bottom white ball. Now, your little clay creations should look like perfect, bundled up snowmen., Baking the polymer clay will harden it and turn the snowmen into wearable earrings. Place your snowmen on a small piece of foil, and place that in the center of a baking tray or cookie sheet. Then, look on the package of your polymer clay to determine the temperature and baking time. It’s crucial that you follow the instructions for the exact type of polymer clay you purchased.Do not place your snowmen in the oven until it has preheated completely.
Once your clay has baked for the full time, turn off the oven. Then, let your clay cool in the turned off oven, or remove it and wrap it in a kitchen towel. It’s important that your clay snowmen cool gradually, instead of abruptly.

, You can buy earring backs at many craft stores or online. Once your snowmen have cooled completely, glue the back of the earring onto the snowman wherever you want it to go.You may want the snowmen to sit higher on your lobe, meaning your earring back should be placed on the body. If you want your snowmen to hang a bit off your lobes, you can glue the back onto the hat of the snowman. It’s completely up to you!

Let the glue dry overnight before wearing your new snowman earrings.

, Use fabric scissors to carefully cut around each circle. Go slowly. You do not want to cut uneven circles for your earrings. This will make your final product look sloppy., Take a small hole puncher. Use it to punch two holes in either earring, near the top of your circles. This is so the circles will dangle downward when you put the hoops in.Use the smallest hole puncher possible. It's not necessary to have very large holes in your earrings.

, You can buy earring hooks at most craft stores. You will have to use pliers or your fingers to gently twist open the loop at the end of the hook. Fit the hook through the holes you made in each earring.Once you've fitted the loop through the hook, use your pliers or fingers to close the hook again.

Try drawing a variety of straight lines criss-crossing and intersecting throughout both triangle. You can use a ruler if necessary to keep your lines straight.
You can draw the same design on each earring or have a slightly different design on each earring.

, Choose a single corner of one triable to punch a hole. Use the smallest hole puncher possible, as you don't need a large hole to fit the earring hook through. Punch another hole in the same corner on your other triangle., You will have to undo the hook at the end of the earring hook using pliers or your fingers. Fit the hook through the holes you punched. Then, tightly re-seal the hook using your fingers or pliers. Your earrings are now complete.Make sure you close the hooks completely. Otherwise, your earrings may slip off and get lost.

Attach hooks to your earrings.",How to Make Leather Earrings3," Take a piece of cardboard and draw a feather shape on it. You can print a template online if you don't want to draw your own feather shape. Carefully cut out the shape you drew.Do not worry about adding feathered edges. You will cut feathers into the actual leather. Keep the sides of your shape smooth.

, On the backside of your chosen leather, use a fabric pen to trace your shape twice. Slowly cut around the shape you drew. You should be left with two feather-shaped pieces of leather in roughly the same size., Take a small sharp pair of scissors. Use it to make tiny cuts about half a centimeter into your shapes running down either side of the feathers. This should provide fringed sides on either earring, giving your earrings the pattern of feathers., Feathers usually have a light line running down the center. You can use thread and a needle to create this line on your earrings. Choose a color thread slightly similar to the color of your leather, but a little darker so it stands out.Use you needle and thread to weave between the front and back of the fabric, stitching a small dotted line running down the center of each earring.
When you reach the end of your feather, tie a knot with the thread to secure the thread in place. Then, cut away any excess thread.

, If you want to add a small gold tip to your feather earrings, you can do so. However, this step is optional. Dip a paint brush in gold acrylic paint and gently dab the paint on tips of your feather earrings.Once you've added the gold paint, you will have to gently separate the fringes on the edges of your earrings to prevent them from sticking together.

, Punch a small hole in the tips of each feather earring. Then, use pliers or your fingers to open to the hoops on the ends of two earring hooks. Fit the hooks through each hole.Use pliers or your fingers to close each hook tightly. Make sure the hooks are fully closed so your earrings won't fall off later.
