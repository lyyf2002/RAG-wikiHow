Gather your materials.,
Wrap the wire around a dowel.,
Cut the ends of the wire.,
Bend the ends of the wire to form the closure.,
Sand the tip of the wire.",How to Make Hoop Earrings1," Making your own hoop earrings is quite easy, but you will need to have some special materials to do it. You may need to visit a craft store to find some or all of these items. You will need:20 gauge wire in the color of your choice. You can use silver plated wire, copper wire, gold plated wire, or any other type that you like.
A dowel in the size of your choice. This is an object that you will wrap the wire around to form hoops. You can use a large dowel or a small one.
Flush cutters. This is a plier-like tool that cuts through wire in a straight line.
Chain-nosed pliers. These pliers have rounded tips.
Round-nosed pliers. These pliers have rounded tips.
Sanding block to remove rough edges.;
, Get your dowel and begin wrapping your wire around the dowel to form it into a hoop shape. Make sure the wire is tight on the dowel to ensure that the wire will form a good shape.Keep in mind that you can use any round object that is the size you would like your earrings to be. You can use a soda can for a large pair of hoop earrings, or a pen for a small pair of hoop earrings.

, Cut the wire so that the ends of the hoop earring will be overlapping by about an inch (2 cm). This will provide enough extra wire for you to create the closure. Use flush cutters to cut the wire straight across and make sure that there are no jagged edges.Be sure to put on a pair of safety goggles before you cut the wire. A piece of the wire my go flying towards your face and it is important to protect your eyes.

, Next, use your round-nosed pliers to bend on end of the wire into a rounded shape. Grasp one of the ends of the wire and slowly wrap it around the round nose pliers until there is a small loop. Then, use chain-nosed pliers to bend the other end of the wire into an upward facing “L” shape.The “L” shaped end will hook into the loop you created to form the closure for your earrings.

, To ensure that the edge of the wire is not rough, use a small sanding block to file the end of the wire that will be inserted into your ear. This is the “L” shaped end. Sand the end until it feels smooth when you run your fingertip across it.After you finish sanding, your earring is ready to wear!
Make a second one in the same way to create a matching pair.

Use a hammer and block to flatten the wire.,
Form the wire into other shapes.,
Bend the wire to create a wavy effect.,
Add beads.",How to Make Hoop Earrings2," You can change the shape of the wire using a hammer and jeweler’s block. Try placing your hoop earring on a jeweler’s block and hammering the hoop to flatten it out.Don’t hammer to much or you may break the wire.

, You can leave your hoops as a classic circle, or you can experiment with other shapes. Use your pliers to bend and shape the wire into other interesting shapes.Try forming the wire into a square, triangle, octagon, or diamond.

, You can also use your pliers to change the look of your hoop earrings. Try using your round nose pliers to bend the wire in a few places and create a wavy effect. You can bend it just a little bit, or bend it into dramatic waves around the entire earring.

If you want to use this technique, then you may want to make your hoops a bit larger to provide slack for bending the wire.

, A simple way to embellish your hoop earrings is to slip some beads onto them. Try using colorful glass beads, crystal beads, or even wooden beads to add some extra flair to your earrings. Arrange the beads in a pattern to create a colorful set of hoop earrings.

Make your template out of thin cardboard.,
Fuse your double-sided interfacing to your fabric.,
Cut the fabric into four equal pieces.,
Peel the backing off.,
Fuse two pieces of fabric together.,
Trace your template onto the fabric scraps once they cool.,
Cut the earrings out using a pair of sharp scissors.,
Use a thumbtack to punch a hole in the top of each earring.If you don't have any thumbtacks at home, you can use a pushpin or a thick needle instead.,
Twist open an earring hook.,
Slip the earring hook into the hole you just made.",How to Make Fabric Earrings1," Draw a simple shape on a thin piece of cardboard. Great starter shapes include circles, triangles, hearts, and leaves. Cut the shape out using a craft blade or a sharp pair of scissors., Set your fabric right-side-down on the ironing board. Place the double-sided interfacing face-down on top. Iron the interfacing according to the manufacturer's instructions.Double-sided interfacing has a shiny side and a matte side. Place it shiny-side down.
Each brand will be a little different. Typically, you will need to iron the interfacing using a low-heat, no-steam setting for a few seconds.

, Each piece should be a little bit bigger than your template. Don't cut it into your final shape just yet, however.

, Go through each of your fabric pieces, and peel the backing of the double-sided interfacing off. You should now have four small pieces of fabric, with the right-side on one side, and the adhesive side on the other., Take two of your fabric scraps, and place them together, right sides facing out. Place the stack on the ironing board, and iron it for a few seconds. Repeat this step with the remaining set of fabric scraps.You should now have two pieces of stiff fabric, with the right side on both sides.


Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the fusing. Typically, you will need to use the same heat setting, but iron it for a little longer.

, The fabric scraps will be very hot and flimsy at first, but they will stiffen as they cool. Once they cool, trace your template onto them. Use a pen to trace the template if your fabric is light-colored. Use chalk if the fabric is dark-colored. Discard the template when you are done, or save it for another project.

, Try to cut just inside the lines that you dress. This way, you won't have to worry about the lines showing. Don't worry about the fabric fraying; the fusible interfacing will prevent that from happening.

, If you want to make statement earrings, consider making a larger hole, and inserting a small grommet or eyelet into the hole.


This method is for hook earrings. If you don't like hook earrings, simple glue the top of each earring to a blank post earring., Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop at the bottom of the earring. Do not pull the loop open, or you will warp it. Think of it as opening a door.


Consider inserting a jump ring first. Keep the earring hook intact. Instead, open up a jump ring using the same technique. , Close the loop by twisting it shut with your needle nose pliers. If there is a small gap in the loop, pinch it shut with your needle nose pliers.


If you are adding a jump ring: slip the jump ring into the hole, then add the earring hook. Close the jump ring using the same technique.

Get some embroidered bridal lace fabric or trim.,
Cut the lace down to the shape you want.Most types of lace will have a floral design on it.,
Paint the lace with decoupage or fabric stiffener.Place the pieces of lace on a smooth surface, such as a sheet of wax paper, plastic wrap, or foil.,
Paint the lace, if desired.You can use fabric paint, acrylic paint, or even spray paint for this.,
Let the lace dry completely.,
Open up an earring hook.,
Slip earring hook through top of the lace.Decide where you want the top of your design to be.,
Close the earring hook.",How to Make Fabric Earrings2," Don't worry about the color; you can always paint it. Instead, look for a thickly-embroidered design that appeals to you. Lace found in the bridal section and in the trim section of a fabric store would be ideal.

, Some may have a scrolled design instead. Take a look at your lace, and find a section of the design that you use best. Use a pair of fabric scissors to it out.


Cut through the fine mesh that's around the embroidered design. Avoid cutting right across an embroidered design.
Cut out two identical designs, one for each earring.

, Paint one side with fabric stiffener and let it dry. Flip the lace over, and paint the other side. This will help stiffen the lace and add some ""weight"" to it.


If you don't have any fabric stiffener at home, use a decoupage glue instead.

, If you are using fabric paint or acrylic paint, consider watering it down first, and applying it in several thin layers. This way, you won't loose the embroidered design.


Paint one side first, let it dry, then paint the other side.

, Depending on the products you used, this could take only a few minutes to several hours. Refer to the label on your bottle of stiffener and paint for more specific drying instructions.

, Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop at the bottom of an earring hook. Do not pull the loop open, as this can weaken the metal.

, Slip the loop you just opened through the lace, close to the edge.

, Use your needle nose pliers to twist the loop back shut, sealing the lace inside. If there is a small gap between the end of the loop and the earring hook, use your needle nose plies to pinch it shut.

Get an aluminum cover button kit from the fabric store.,
Use the included template to trace a circle onto your fabric.Most button cover kits have a template printed on the back.,
Cut the fabric circle out.,
Press the fabric into the tool.,
Press the button down into the tool.,
Tuck the edges of the fabric into the button.,
Place the back of the button on top of the fabric.,
Use the other part of the button maker to assemble your button.,
Glue an earring post to the back of the button.,
Make a second earring, then wait for both to dry.",How to Make Fabric Earrings3," Your kit needs to include a button cover tool, or you won't be able to put the buttons together. You can choose any size kit you want.

, Use a pair of scissors to cut the template out, then a pen or pencil to trace it onto your fabric. You will need one circle per button.


Some kits come with a plastic template inside the package. If your kit is one of those, use that instead.

, Don't worry if the edges aren't perfectly even—they will be tucked inside the button.

, Cover button kits come with two parts: a large, squishy part, and a small hard, plastic part. You are looking for the large, squishy part. Set the large, squishy part down, and place the fabric over it.

, Make sure that you are placing the button curved-side-down into the tool. The fabric may shift while you are doing this, so be careful. If the fabric shifts, you will need to adjust it. You want there to be equal amounts of fabric all around the button.

, Don't worry if the fabric crumples or looks bulky. You will likely need to hold the fabric in place with your finger.

, Some button cover kits come with two types of backs: a smooth back and a back with a shank on it. Choose the smooth back.


If your button kit only came with the shanked backings, use a pair of needle nose pliers to pull the shank out., Take the smaller, plastic part of your button maker. Press it on top of the button backing, making sure that the fabric is tucked under it. Push down hard on it. You should feel a slight ""thump"" as the button comes together.


If you don't feel the thump, try hitting the plastic part with a hammer or mallet.

, Place a large glob of glue on the front of a blank earring post, then press the post against the back of the button. Don't worry if some glue leaks out.

, Once the earrings are dry, they are ready to wear!

Gather your materials.,
Thread some beads onto the headpin.,
Cut the headpin to size.,
Curl the top of the headpin.,
Attach the French hook earwire.,
Tighten the hook.,
Repeat the process to make the second earring.",How to Make Earrings1," To make these beaded earrings you will need: two headpins, a round-nosed pliers, two French hook earwires and a selection of beads - they can be pearl, crystal, plastic or glass - it's a matter of personal preference.;
, How many you fit on each headpin will depend on how large the beads are and how long you want your earrings to be. Experiment with different colors and bead sizes to find a style you like.








, To shorten the length of the earring, use your pliers to cut the end of the headpin. Just make sure to leave a centimeter between the last bead and the end of the wire.








, Take your round-nosed pliers and use it to curl the top of the headpin, until it forms a complete loop.








, Take one of the French hook earwires and use your pliers to open the hook on the end. Slip the open hook through the loop you made on the end of the headpin.








, Close the open hook using your pliers. Make it nice and tight so the earrings won't fall apart.

Gather your materials.,
Cut one full circle from the memory wire.,
Curl one edge of the hoop.,
Thread the beads on.,
Curl the other edge of the hoop.,
Hook the two loops into one another.,
Attach the French hook earwire.,
Repeat the process to make the second earring.",How to Make Earrings2," To make hoop earrings you will need a tube of memory wire, a memory wire cutter (pliers will leave dents in the wire), round nose pliers, two French hook earwires and a selection of beads (optional).

, This will form the hoop of your earring. If you want a smaller-sized hoop, use the cutter to snip off a section of wire.








, Take your round nosed pliers and use it to curl one edge of the wire hoop underneath itself, until it forms a complete loop.








, If you want to make beaded hoops, thread the desired number of beads onto the wire - you can experiment with different colors and bead types to find a pattern you like. For plain hoops, just skip to the next step.








, Take the pliers and use it to curl the other edge of the wire - except this time you are curling the wire outwards rather than underneath. Curl it until you form an almost complete loop.








, Hook the loop that's curled outwards into the loop that's curled underneath. If necessary, use the pliers to tighten each loop. This should keep the earring secured.







, Take the French hook earwire and use your pliers to open the loop at the bottom. Hook the open loop of the earwire onto one of the closed loops at the top of the earring hoop. Close the loop with your pliers.








, Remember to measure the second hoop against the first to make sure they are the same size.

Gather your materials.,
Clean the earring posts.,
Decorate the studs.",How to Make Earrings3," To make stud earrings you will need: two stud-style earring posts and two rubber or butterfly backs. You will also need a hot glue gun or some superglue. The other materials will depend on what kind of earrings you want to make - you can use pearls or beads, pieces of colored fabric or glitter glue.

, Use a damp cloth or a q-tip dipped in some rubbing alcohol to clean the earring posts. This removes any dust and makes them safe to wear. You could also use a piece of sandpaper to rough-up the face of the earring post, as this helps the glue to stick better.








, Now you're free to attach anything you like to the face of the earring post.









Pearl or glass beads are an easy option that produces simple, pretty results. Just place a drop of glue on the earring post and press the bead against it, holding it for a minute while the glues sets.
To make flower studs, cut out eight circles (each one slightly smaller from the last) from the colored net fabric. Layer the circles one on top of the other to form a flower pattern, then use a threaded needle to sew a small bead onto the center of the flower. Secure the flower with a couple of stitches at the back. Place a dot of glue on the earring post and stick the flower on top.
The easiest option is just to cover the face of the earring post in some gold, silver or colored glitter glue and wait for it to dry. Then you have a simple sparkly earring!

Plan how wide you want your ring to be, and mark it with a Sharpie or other marker.,
Place pipe segment on table or another edge, and using a hacksaw, cut vertically down your mark.,
Take a sheet of #150 grit sandpaper and place on a table or other flat surface, rough side up.,
Sand until desired thickness.,
Once the side is smoothed, hold the #150 grit sandpaper and ring in your hands.,
Once you have the ring in the desired size and shape, take the #220 or finer sandpaper and gently sand the entire ring, so it is very smooth.",How to Make and Engrave a PVC Ring1,";
, You may need assistance holding the rest of the pipe from moving around while cutting. You should end up with the piece that you will sand down to your final product.

, Place the side you just cut from the pipe on the sandpaper and rub in a back and forth motion, applying slight pressure. If the pipe was too tight on your finger, sand out the inside of the ring until it fits properly.

, Remember, the sandpaper is rough, and PVC is not, so it does not take much time to sand it down too far and mess up. Make sure the ring is as vertical from the surface as you can get it to ensure there are no high or low spots on the ring.

, Sand down the edges, so they are gently curved and look like a real rings' edges.

, It will not be glossy like PVC pipe unless you polish it, so don't worry if it looks dull.

If you want to engrave your ring, take the propane/mapp gas torch and metal pick/ paper clip.,
Set torch on a low setting.,
9 Place tip of pick/ paper clip into the blue part of the flame until it glows red.,
Once done engraving, place ring in cool water for 10-20 seconds.",How to Make and Engrave a PVC Ring2," Light torch.

, Take the pick and hold it like a pencil or paintbrush. If using a paper clip, bend it out all the way to a straight shape.

, Quickly take a pick out of flame and place on the ring in the desired location and start engraving your name or whatever you wish to write. The hot pick will easily melt through the PVC, so don't push too hard. When it does get hard to push, this means it is cooling down. You need to put the tip of the pick back into the flame until it glows red hot again and continue engraving. It will smell bad, but it is harmless. This step may take a while

, This will stop the possible deformation of the ring due to the heat from the pick.

If engraving and painting, engrave first.

,
Clean ring with soap and water to wash off oils and other contaminants.,
Get some paint and primer (spray or brush), ring, and, if using spray paint, overspray protector (newspaper, old tarp, etc.),
Using primer, apply a thin coat to the ring and let dry for 15-30 minutes.,
To ensure strong base coat, let primer dry overnight.,
If desired, apply a single medium-thin coat of clear finish to the ring after the paint is done drying.

",How to Make and Engrave a PVC Ring3,", Then wash your hands.

, Go to a well ventilated area.

, Repeat 2-3 times.

, Apply a thin coat of paint to the ring. Repeat as you did in the previous step, but with the paint. Let dry overnight.

Use the string to measure out the width of your ear where you want the cuff.,
Cut about 20 cm of thin wire and smooth the edges with the nail file.,
Grip the end of the wire with the pliers, then turn it into a small circular hook.,
Measure out your cuff measurement (taken with the string) from the bottom of the circle.,
Bend the wire back on itself at your measurement.,
Bend the wire into a zig-zag, bending the wire back where it is even with your hook.,
Use your pliers to create another hook right at the last bend of the wire.,
Cut off the excessive wire so you have hooks on both ends of the wire.,
Mold your ear cuff around a large pen or Sharpie to bend it.",How to Make Ear Cuffs1," Take the string in both hands and hold it up to your ear, placing it where you want to put your cuff. Use your fingers to pinch off the string at the right width, then compare it to a ruler to know how long your wire will need to be.









Get this measurement as close as possible -- it determines how snugly it will attach to your ear.
You should measure the entire width you want to be cuffed -- basically, where is the cuff going to sit on the front and back of your ear.;
, Cut your first length of wire and then ""sand"" down and jagged edges with the file. When in doubt, give yourself a little longer wire to work with -- you can always cut it later.









More intricate designs may require longer wire.
You want roughly 22-guage wire, roughly 1-2mm thick in diameter.

, You should use needle-nose pliers (they taper into a point) for the greatest control. Bend the end into a small round hook, almost like a pin head.








, Take your ruler and measure down from the little bent circle of wire. If your measurement for the cuff was 1"", then move 1"" down. Think of making a ""balloon"" with a 1"" string.








, Turn the wire back so that it is doubled up on itself (kinda like a paper clip). You'll have a U-shaped bend with the wire extending up on one side and the hook on the other.








, Take the long piece of wire and bend the whole thing into a ""Z"" shape. Keep bending the wire back and forth like this until you've made a complete zig-zag shape. You should have one free piece of wire hanging off the last curve.








, Right now, you have a long zig-zagging piece of wire, with a hook on one end and a free end of wire on the other. With the pliers, grab wire right at the last bend before the free end of wire, then use your fingers to rotate the wire around the pliers and create another hook.








, You'll have a little ""W"" when done, with hooks on the top of the letter. Cut the excess wire, and use your hands to mold both ends into little hooks if they've moved.








, To get the right curve, take the whole shape and bend it around a pen, or another cylindrical object. A normal permanent marker is usually perfect, as the ""classic"" Bic pens may be too thin to effectively round off the cuff.









Once you put the cuff in your ear, you can use your fingers to lightly mold it into place, helping it stick naturally in your ear.

Gather your supplies.,
Choose the emoji stickers you want to use.,
Cut out the pieces of the file folder with your emoji stickers on it.,
When you've cut out your emojis, take your sewing needle and make a small hole in the little space at the top of your sticker.,
Insert the earrings where you poked the holes with the needle.",How to Make Emoji Earrings," For this project you will need a pack of emoji stickers, scissors, a sewing needle, a file folder, and two matching stud earrings (with backs).;
, Then, rip a piece of the file folder off. When you've done this, stick your emoji stickers on the piece of the file folder.

, Carefully cut around all the details of the sticker, and be sure not to cut the sticker itself. Leave a little space at the top of your sticker where the earring will go.

, Do this with both emoji stickers.

, They should fit inside and be stopped by the gem or bead at the end of the stud earring. Insert into your ear, fasten with the earring back and then you're done!

Assemble the basic equipment listed below.,

Set up your work space.,

Choose a design.,

Using head pins, arrange the beads onto the pin in the order you want them to be on the earring.
,

Use the round-nosed pliers to bend the wire 90 degrees, cut to allow approximately 1 centimeter (0.4 in) past the bend.
,

Again using the pliers, bend the wire into a loop, but leave it slightly open for now.
,

Pass the loop of the headpin through the earring loop, and then close the loop using the pliers.
,

Repeat for a pair.
",How to Make Dangly Earrings," Most of these are available at craft shops or at a specialist bead shop - try to search online if there is not one near you.
, You'll need a clear space and a well lit area. Always work on a tray, just in case the beads split., There are no limits to your imagination, and the internet also has lots of ideas for earring designs, but remember to try to stick to the level you are currently working at. The easiest types are simple drop earrings, and how to make these are described below.,,,,,"

Measure, cut, and bend a hook into the end of your wire like normal.,
Pinching your pliers right underneath the loop, bend the wire back on itself to make a figure eight.,
Pinching underneath the figure eight, create one more loop to make a clover.,
Using your measurements, create the zig-zag pattern back and forth with the remaining wire.,
Work backward to create another clover on the opposite side.,
Bend the cuff around your pen for a perfectly shaped ear cuff.,
Measure, cut, and sand down 20 centimeter (7.9 in) or so of wire.,
Bend the wire about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) from the end into a loop, with extra length of wire on both sides.,
Measure out your cuff width from the bottom of the loop down the long stretch of wire.,
Bend the wire back on itself at your measurement point.,
Measure out your cuff width and bend it back behind the loop one last time.,
Bend the top of the wire back down over the front, creating a second loop.,
Wrap some of the remaining wire around the center of the bow to hold it in place.,
Bend only the long oval of wire, not the bow, around your pen to create the cuff.,
Measure, cut, and sand off 2–3 centimeter (0.79–1.2 in) of wire.,
Bend it in half, tightening the two sides so they are as close as possible.,
Make two little spiral hooks, pointing towards each other, on the both ends of the wire.,
Bend the entire shape over a thin pen.",How to Make Ear Cuffs2," Use the string to measure out the width of your cuff. Then cut about 20 centimeter (8 in) of wire off for your cuff and make the small loop with the point of the pliers around the very end of wire.








, Place one-half of the pliers in the loop, the other underneath. Then bend the wire around the pliers to form a figure eight at the bottom of the wire.








, You'll be bending this wire above the figure eight, then curve it back down so you have a little three-leaf clover, with the wire pointing downward.

, Keep doubling the wire up until you have roughly one free length of wire left. You should be making an M or W shaped center for your cuff.








, Simply reverse the methods above to create another clover on the opposite end. You could create any design you want, of course, but matching clovers will look extra professional.








, Remember that you may want to experiment with the pen size, and need to mold the final shape a bit by hand.








, Just like the last two designs, cut out some wire to work with and sand out any jagged edges with the nail file.








, Use the pliers to bend a loop into the wire, turning it into a subtle L-shape. The ""ends"" extending off the loop should be roughly perpendicular.








, Measure down the long end, away from your loop, then pinch this spot with the pliers.








, Tuck it back behind the loop, keeping it back behind the cuff.








, Things will look a bit like a bow at this point, or a tied up paperclip. There is the loop in front, with a small wire hanging down, and long rounded wire behind the loop. There should still be a long area of wire still available behind the loop.








, Now the bow shape will start to come together. There should be two loops on top and the hanging bits of wire below, with a long, oval-like wire behind everything.








, Come up and around the center of your two bows to hold everything in place. Use your fingers and the pliers to keep adjusting, keeping things in place and shaping the bow how you want it. Cut off any excess wire and sand any jagged edges.








, This is your cuff, and the bow needs to stay nice and flat. Simple bend this long cuff around your pen, molding it so it fits on your ear.








, This small little cuff is meant to fit on you ""tragus,"" the little, rounded flap where your ear meets your jawbone. If you have larger ears, go closer to 3cm.








, Use the pliers and your fingers to bring both sides of the wire close, so that they are basically doubled up.








, You'll end up with a heart-shaped set of wires. Use the pliers to try and keep the bottom still nice and tight.









Use your fingers and the pliers to keep molding your heart shape. The tips of the pliers are really good to bend small circles or loops around.

, This is the curve that keeps it on your tragus. Use your fingers and/or the pliers to mold it so that it fits snugly on your ear.

Choose your ear wire.,
Buy wire, pins, chains, and rings.,
Select your beads.,
Get the right tools.,
Buy a chandelier finding.,
Use a wire jig.,
Weave the wire.,
Plan out your design.,
Attach beads using a simple loop.,
Consider the wrapped loop technique.,
Use chain.,
Incorporate other materials.",How to Make Chandelier Earrings," The first step to making your own earrings is to decide how you want the earring to attach to your ears. You can buy several different kinds of ear wires at craft or beading stores, from straight posts, to shepherd’s hook and even clip-on varieties. Choose whichever design you prefer. They all come with a loop for you to attach your earring to.If you’re good at bending wire, you can also attempt to make your own shepherd’s hook.
If you choose the shepherd's hook design, it’s a good idea to use plastic earring stoppers to prevent the earrings from falling out.;
, The exact design of your earrings will determine which of these materials you need. If you plan on making multiple pairs or if you want to experiment, you may want to get all of them.Jewelry wire comes in many different gauges, which are each suitable for different applications. The smaller the gauge, the thicker the wire. 20 gauge wire is ideal for bending into a simple chandelier design, but you may want to opt for a thinner wire if you plan on doing a lot of weaving or coiling.Head pins are small piece of wire that are used to attach beads to your earrings. One end has a flat head to prevent the bead from slipping off.
Eye pins are similar to head pins, but instead of a flat head, they have a loop on one end which holds the bead in place and allows you to attach another bead to it.
Jewelery chains are not required for all designs, but they can be used to hang beads from if you don’t want your earrings to be completely rigid. They come in a variety of thicknesses.
Jump rings are tiny metal rings that are used to connect beads to one another.
All of these materials are available in different metal finishes, so make sure everything matches, unless of course you’re going for a mixed-metal look.

, Beads are probably the most exciting part of chandelier earrings, and there are so many different options to choose from! Depending on your style, you can select from materials like crystal, glass, ceramic, and plastic. They all come in a wide variety of colors, shapes, and sizes.If you’re buying beads online, you may want to consult a size chart so you have a good idea how big the beads will be. Remember that large beads may be heavy, which can make your earrings uncomfortable.
All of the beads that you find at a beading store or in the jewelry section of a craft store should have a hole that goes all the way through the bead, which will allow you to attach it to your earring. If you are looking for less conventional add-ons, make sure there is a way to attach them.
If you want to add a little more personality to your beads, you can buy bead caps, which are intricate metal pieces that sit on top of the beads.If you don't want to buy beads, you can make your own from materials like glass, paper, or clay. Keep in mind that making beads is a separate skill, so you might want to focus on learning one thing at a time.

, In order to make beautiful jewelry, you will need to purchase a few simple tools. If you’re just getting started, you may be able to get by with tools that you already have around the house.A pair of rounded needle nosed pliers is an absolute must for making earrings. Get a heftier pair if you plan on working with thick wire, or a smaller pair if you plan on doing more delicate work.
Flat nosed pliers can come in handy if you need to make a sharp turn in your wire. You will probably find it helpful to have two pairs of pliers if you are bending wire a lot.
You will need a pair of wire snippers to cut excess wire. If you are working with very thin wire, you may be able to get away with using nail clippers.
It’s also important to have a pair of safety glasses to wear while cutting wire.

, If you’re new to beading and you want to start out small, you may want to buy a pre-made chandelier finding. This is the metal part of the earring from which the beads hang, and it is often very elaborate. You can find many different styles of chandelier findings and then customize them by adding your own beads., If you want to try your hand at making your own chandelier findings, you can bend your jewelry wire into the desired shape by using a wire jig. The jig is a flat plate with small pegs that you use to help create consistent shapes and loops.Use your pliers to wrap the wire tightly around each peg. You can create small loops to hang beads from by wrapping the wire around a single peg, or create larger shapes by wrapping the wire around multiple pegs.
You can use your own imagination to come up with your designs or you can follow a template, which are easy to find online.

, Another option for creating your own chandelier findings is weaving. This method is much more intricate and complicated, but it is also very beautiful and extremely versatile. You can create many different patterns by weaving, so consult a book or search online for a pattern.In order to weave wire, you will need at least two frame wires, which are thick pieces of wire that you will use to bend the weaving wire around. The frame wires should be sturdy enough that they do not bend easily. If you want a larger or more intricate design, you can use more than two frame wires.
Use masking tape to attach the frame wires to each other. They should not be touching because you will need to be able to manipulate your weaving wire between them. The distance between the frame wires will depend on the size and intricacy of your pattern. Depending on your design, they can be taped at each end so the wire are parallel, or just at one end so the wires are tapered.
In order to create different patterns, use your pliers to wrap a thinner, pliable piece of jewelry wire back and forth between the frame wires. You can coil the wire once or multiple times between each pass, depending on the look you are trying to achieve.
Once you’ve weaved your design, you will need to use your pliers to bend it into the desired shape for your earring.

, Before you begin attaching the various parts of your earrings, it’s a good idea to lay everything out and make sure you are happy with the design.

, The most straightforward way to attach your beads and other adornments to your earrings is by using your pliers to create a simple loop.


Thread an eye pin or head pin through your bead and hold it securely so that no excess wire protrudes from the bottom of the bead.
Use a pair of pliers to bend the wire in a 90 degree angle at the top of the bead.
Use your wire snippers to cut off any wire that is not needed for your loop. The amount you cut will depend on the size you want the loop to be.
Grab the end of the wire with your pliers and bend it towards the top of the bead, creating a loop.
Leave the loop open enough that you can hook it over the loop on your chandelier finding. Then use your pliers to squeeze the loop closed.

, If you want your beads to be more securely attached to your earrings, use your pliers to create a wrapped loop. With this method, you will need to be able to open the loop on the chandelier finding in order to attach your bead.Start by threading your eye pin or head pin through your bead.
Grasp the wire with one pair of pliers, making sure they are resting snuggly against the bead and there is no excess wire protruding from the bottom of the bead. Then use your other pair of pliers to bend the wire over the first pair, creating a 90 degree angle.
Release both pairs of pliers and reposition one pair on the horizontal part of the wire, near the bend. Use the other pair of pliers to bend the wire all the way around the other pair, creating a complete loop.
Wrap the remaining wire around the base of the loop several times and then use your wire cutters to trim the excess off.

, You can use chain to add texture and movement to your chandelier earrings. There are many different ways to incorporate chain into your design, depending on your individual preferences.You can use chain between the ear wire and the chandelier finding to allow for more movement.
You can try using chain to connect two shaped findings. You can then hang beads from the bottom piece, or you can hang beads from both if the top piece is larger than the bottom piece.
You can use multiple pieces of wire to suspend beads from your chandelier finding.
Alternatively, you can forgo the wire finding altogether and hang one or many pieces of wire directly from the ear wire. You can then hang beads from the bottom of each chain or all along the length of each chain.

, The sky is the limit when it comes to jewelry design, so don’t feel like you’re limited to wire and beads. If you want to incorporate other materials, like fabric, feathers, or rhinestones, feel free to experiment.

Purchase earring converters.,
Insert the post into the barrel.,
Try a no bend converter.",How to Convert Pierced Earrings to Clip On Earrings1," You can buy earring converters online or your local craft store. The converters are usually located in the jewelry making area. Look for a converter that has a small tube/barrel on the back.Most posts will fit into the barrel of the converter, but check the size of your posts just to be sure.;
, Slide the post into the barrel of the converter. Then bend the post about 90°. Bending the post will make your earrings have a more natural position on your ear.Use a slow steady motion to bend the posts. If the posts are kind of thick, bend them with pliers before you insert them into the barrel.
Once you bend the posts, the earrings cannot be used as pierced earrings anymore.

, If you do not want to bend the post or would still like the option of wearing them as a pierced earring, you can use a no bend converter. Simply place the post in the barrel and then put the earrings on. The earrings will sit below your earlobe. Pierced stud earrings usually sit around the middle of your earlobe so it may look a little weird if you use this type of converter.Drop and dangle earrings with posts are better suited for no bend converters.

Finishing.",How to Handcraft Earrings from Recycled Guitar Strings,"  If you aren't a musician who uses guitar stings or other metal strings, than try to find one or ask a local music store if they have waste strings around to give you.  Although guitar strings are relatively inexpensive, it never hurts to get your materials for free!;
,  Look at the following pictures to get an Idea of what you can do with different strings.  Nickel wrapped strings have a great look, but bronze strings (acoustic guitar) provide a vintage look.  You have strings that wound, and strings that aren't.  Those strings that are wound can be unraveled and re-wrapped to create customer designs. For this ring there is no needed to unravel a string yet, however you want to use a strong sting so I recommend the Low-E string (Also 6th or 42-56 gauge) of an acoustic or electric guitar.

, Cleaning may be necessary, also sometimes heating the material and letting it cool slowly (annealing) is needed.

, For a size 9 ring I know the circumference is 48.7mm so I can round up some to adjust for the wire's thickness in order to get the desired length. On this ring design we want the two ends of the wire to overlap so you will want 4/3 of the desired ring circumference.

, Pinch the end of the wire and pull it lose from the core. Repeat on the other side. Remove the amount of overlap you will have to make the ring the correct length (will be 1/4 of length or 1/8th off each end = 8mm)

, Choose whatever color you are interested in. I used 4 beads and started by adding them to each side. Make sure the beads have large enough holes to fit 2 core wires in it. I added my first bead and strung only the core wire through it. I threaded the core wire and the unwrapped wire through the second bead and pulled it tight, bending the unwrapped wire away to keep them from falling off.

,, Bend the wound run of wire into a ring shape, and then feed the core wire through the beads.

, Use the winding wire; make a full rotation and pull tight with pliers(without breaking wire, just make a tight even wind). Then pull it to the next gap in-between beads, and then repeat the full rotation.

,, You want this ring to never move, because you made it to a size specified so it would fit.

,,, The ends of the wrapped wire may be exposed and sharp, you may glue this part in place and/or sand it to get rid of sharp edges. Also use your pliers and or fingers to bend the ring into a round shape.

Chain four.,
Double crochet into the chain.,
Double crochet around.,
Fasten off the yarn.,
Tie the circle to the earring hook.,
Weave in the ends.,
Repeat for the other earring.",How to Crochet Earrings1," Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work four chain stitches from the loop on the hook.
, Work 12 double crochet into the fourth chain stitch from the hook.

When finished, slip stitch the last double crochet to the the top of the beginning chain-four.
The piece should develop its circular form after you complete this step.

, Chain three, then work two double crochet into each double crochet of the previous round.

Slip stitch the last double crochet into the top of the chain-three made at the start of this round.

, Cut the yarn, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

This step finishes the actual crochet work for one earring, but you'll still need to attach the piece to an earring hook before you can wear it.
Do not trim the tail any further than this. You'll need plenty of excess to attach the circle to the earring hook.

, Thread the long tail end of yarn through the loop on the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the yarn around this loop to hold the crochet circle in place.

Draw as much yarn through the earring loop as possible before knotting it. Ideally, the knot should remain hidden behind the crochet piece. That knot should also be very small so that it won't be visible from the front.

, Weave the excess tails into the stitches along the back of the circle.

Consider trimming the excess ends down to a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) before weaving them into the piece. Attempting to weave too much excess into the stitches can cause those stitches to lose form.

, Follow the same exact steps to complete another earring that matches the first.

Crochet the circle, attach it to another earring hook, and weave in the yarn ends.
Once you complete both earrings, the set is finished and ready to wear.

Purchase fish hook converters.,
Remove the fish hook.,
Use a hoop converter.",How to Convert Pierced Earrings to Clip On Earrings2," Go online or visit the jewelry section of your local craft store. Look for converters that are made for fish hook earrings. These converters replace the pierced earring hook instead of working in conjunction with the pierced earring.These converters will have a small extra hoop in the front that will be used to attach the earring.

, Use jewelry pliers to gently remove the piece that goes through your ear. Open the small hoop on the converter and place it around the hole on the pierced earring. Use the pliers to close the loop. Your earrings are now ready to wear.If you do not want to remove the fish hook, you can use a hoop converter instead.

, A hoop converter is a thin metal hoop that you attach to the pierced earring. If you use this with a fish hook earing, use your pliers to close the opening of the pierced earring first. Once the fish hook is closed, hang it on the hoop converter.This method is one of the quickest. The pierced earring remains intact because you do not have to remove any pieces.
Keep in mind that this type of converter will add extra length to your earrings.
If the pierced earrings are heavy, you may want to use a fish hook converter instead.

Use clip-on cushions.,
Loosen the tongue.,
Wear for short periods of time.,
Clean your ears and earrings.",How to Convert Pierced Earrings to Clip On Earrings3," Go to a jewelry store or to any store that sells jewelry and purchase clip-on earring cushions. Some of the cushions use adhesive to stick to the clips. Other cushions slide over the clips to create some extra padding for your ears. If using adhesive pads, the foam should be placed on the part of the clip that touches the back of your ear lobe.Most of these cushions are reusable.
You can also use adhesive backed foam pads from the hardware or craft store. Cut the pads to whatever size you need.

, The most common types of clip on converters are paddle-back clip-ons. These clip-ons have a metal tongue that makes your clip-ons fit nice and tight. If your ears are hurting, use a pair of tweezers, a thin screw driver, or a clip-on comfort key to gently lift the tongue. Lift the tongue a little bit and then try your earrings on to see how they feel. Continue to do this until you find a fit that is snug yet comfortable .If you loosen the tongue too much, your earrings will not stay on your ear.
Lifting the tongue too quickly can cause the tongue to break off.
A comfort key is a special tool used for adjusting clip-on earrings. You should be able to find one wherever you bought your other supplies.

, If cushions and/or loosening the tongue does not help, you may need to limit the amount of time you wear your earrings. Your earrings may feel fine for the first few hours that you wear them and begin to hurt later. Also, you may be able to wear some earrings all day and others for only a few hours.


It may be helpful to wear your clips-ons around the house first to see how your ears feel over time. Then you will know your limits for each pair of earrings that you have.

, To clean your earrings, mix one drop of baby shampoo with water and use a Q-Tip or soft toothbrush to clean. Quickly rinse with cool water and use a hairdryer on cool setting or a soft hand towel to dry. There is no hard and fast rule for cleaning earrings, but the earrings you wear more should be cleaned more frequently.Avoid using anything acidic like vinegar or baking soda to clean.
If you notice any green stuff on your earrings, use a toothpick, soft toothbrush, or Q-Tip to remove it.
Put rubbing alcohol on a cotton ball or pad to clean your ears. This will remove any germs.

Slip stitch the last stitch to the first chain of this round.

, Cut the thread. leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

The actual doily ornament is finished once you complete this step, but you'll still need to attach it to an earring hook before you can wear it.
Do not trim or weave in the tail yet. You'll need it to attach the doily to the earring wire.

, Insert the tail end of crochet thread through the loop at the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the thread over this loop to attach the doily to the wire.

Pull the thread as taut as possible before knotting it, and try to make the knot as small as possible. Ideally, the knot should remain hidden behind the doily and should not be visible from the front.

, Weave the excess thread into the back side of the doily stitches.

Consider trimming the excess down to a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm). Since these earrings are fairly dainty, weaving too much excess into the stitches could cause them to become bulky and distorted.

, Follow the same steps to complete another earring that matches the first.

Crochet the doily, attach it to the earring hook, and weave in the excess.
After completing the second earring, the pair should be finished and ready to show off.

Chain and single crochet a second row.,
Fasten off the thread.,
Repeat for the second hoop.",How to Crochet Earrings3," Tie the crochet thread onto the tip of the steel crochet hook using a standard slip knot.

In this pattern, you'll need to crochet around the edge of a blank hoop earring. As a result, you'll move directly into the pattern stitches instead of building up a foundation of chains.

, Work one slip stitch over the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch within 1/4 inch (6 mm) of one end.

Hold the hook over the front of the earring hoop while directing the working end of the thread beneath the hoop.
Hook the thread over the edge of the hoop, as though working over the edge of a stitch, and pull it through the loop on your hook. This completes the slip stitch and secures the thread to the earring hoop.

, Single crochet once around the edge of the metal hoop, positioning the stitch directly next to the previous slip stitch.

Position the tip of the hook beneath the earring hoop and hook the thread.
Pull the hooked thread around to the front of the earring hoop.
Hook the thread again from the front, then pull this newest loop through the two thread loops beneath it. This completes the first single crochet.

, Continue making single crochet stitches around the rest of the earring hoop, stopping within 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) of the opposite end.

Note that you may need to periodically push the formed single crochet stitches down the side of the earring to keep them even.

Chain one, skip a stitch, and work three triple crochet into the stitch that follows; repeat this pattern until you reach the final stitch of your foundation chain.
As you work down the chain, you should notice the piece curling into the desired spiral shape.

, Work one double crochet, one single crochet, and one slip stitch into the final stitch of the foundation chain.

Work all three of these stitches into the same chain. These will be the last stitches you'll make, so you should be able to see the finished spiral form by the end of this step.

, Cut the thread, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

You'll need a long tail to attach the spiral to the earring hook, so do not trim it after fastening off the work.

, Thread the tail through the loop at the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the thread around this loop.

Keep the thread fairly taut as you tie it and only make a small knot. The knot itself will be visible, but you should not see any unused thread in between the spiral and the earring hook.

, Weave any excess thread into the stitches at the inside of the spiral to both secure and hide it.

Consider trimming the excess down to roughly 2 inches (5 cm) before weaving it into the stitches. Weaving in too much excess can distort the shape of the spiral.

, Repeat the same steps to make another earring that matches the first.

Gather your materials.,
Lay out your bead design.,
Add your beads to each headpin.,
Bend the free end of the pin into a 90 degree angle.,
Create your loop.,
Trim away the excess and flatten the loop.,
Hang the earrings on the earwires of your choice.",How to Make Drop Earrings1," For each earring, you will need a headpin, a French hook earwire (or other earwire or earpost), and an assortment of beads. You will also need wire cutters, needle-nose pliers, and flat pliers.


You can use any combination of beads you like, as long as at least two can fit on a headpin.French hook earwires, also called earhooks, are the portion of the earring that is in direct contact with your ears. As their name suggests, they consist of a large hook, which hangs from your ear. On the opposite end of the large hook is a small circular loop (a ""jump ring"") used to attach the hook to the decorative portion of the earring. Earwires are typically made of hypoallergenic metals that are resistant to corrosion and discoloration.;
, Before you ""string"" your beads, it's a good idea to plan your design first. Start by placing a headpin on its side to keep its length in mind. Next, organize beads in a straight line parallel to the headpin.Don't take up more that about two thirds of the headpin's length.
Swap beads around until you've found a pattern that works best.
Many drop earrings have a large dangling piece at the bottom. Consider a string of small spacer beads on top of one big ornate one.

, ""String"" your beads onto their headpin, starting with the bottom-most bead and ending at the top.You may find that the design doesn't quite ""work"" for you once actually on the pin. At this stage, it's easy to simply remove and reorganize the beads as many times as you'd like.








, Hold the pin just above the top button with the tip of either pair of pliers. Use your thumb to press down on the free end of the headpin until it is completely horizontal in relation to the rest of the pin., Grip the headpin with your needle-nose pliers just above the bend. Pull the wire down around your pliers. Rotate your pliers slightly by turning your wrist clockwise. Finish the loop by pulling the end of the wire back around to form a small circle.







, If there is any excess wire at the end of the bent headpin, trim it away with your wire cutters. The tail end of the loop should just touch the beginning without overlapping. Squeeze the loop with your flat pliers so the entire loop is flat and level.







, Because the loop you just made functions as a jump ring, you can attach your new earrings to any type of earwire or earpost you'd prefer.Simply use your needle-nose pliers to push down on the tail end of the jump ring to open it. Hook the ring around the earwire's own jump ring or other attachment loop. Close the jump ring by pushing up in the opposite direction to complete the loop.

Find a wooden frame and take out the backing and glass panel.,
Paint the frame and let it dry.,
Consider decorating the frame further, especially if it is a plain frame.,
Use a marker to trace the glass panel onto a sheet of plastic canvas.,
Cut the plastic canvas/mesh out.,
Glue the mesh to the back of your frame.Flip your frame over so that the back is facing you.,
Cut a piece of ribbon.,
Make a loop from the ribbon, then glue it to the back of your frame.,
Wait for the glue to dry, then hang your earring holder.",How to Make a Homemade Earring Holder2," You can discard the backing, but save the glass panel. You will be using it to trace the plastic canvas/mesh later.


You can use a plain frame, or an ornate one.

, You can use spray paint or acrylic paint. Be sure to get the back and sides of the frame as well. Depending on how dark your frame is, or how light the paint is, you may need two coats of paint. Let the first layer dry before adding the second one., You can leave your frame plain as it is, or you can decorate it further to make it more special. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Glue some plastic gems or rhinestones along the frame
Draw some designs on the frame using black, gold, or silver permanent marker
Paint some bold designs on the frame, such as stripes, stars, or hearts
Draw designs on the frame using glitter glue

, Plastic canvas looks like a plastic mesh or screen. It is stiff, and used to wave designs onto with yarn. Choose a color that matches your frame, or goes well with it.

, Be sure cut along the lines, or it may fall through your frame.

, Draw a line of glue all along the inside edges of the frame, where the glass panel used to rest. Quickly press the plastic canvas into the glue.


You can use hot glue or an industrial-strength (such as E6000) for this. Don't use regular school glue; it won't be strong enough.

, Choose a color that matches your frame, then cut it down so that it matches your frame's width.

, Tie the ends of the ribbon together to make a knot. Place some glue on the back of your frame, near the top, then press the knot into the glue.


If your frame has a metal bracket for hanging, you can thread the ribbon through this bracket. You can also hang the frame from the wall using just the bracket.
If you don't want to hang your earring holder, get a frame stand instead, and set the frame down onto it instead.

, You can now stick earrings into the mesh. This works well with hook and post earrings. When attaching post earrings, you will need to take the back off the earring first, push the earring through the mesh, then put the back on again.

, You can use acrylic paint or spray paint.If your hoop is made from plastic, it might be better to leave it the original color; paint scratches off plastic easily. If your hoop is made from wood, you can paint it any color you'd like. You can also leave it blank, if you'd like something more rustic.

, You will trim off the excess fabric after you put the hoop back together.

, Try to center the lace as much as possible. There should be equal amounts of fabric hanging off the edges of your hoop.

, If you took the knob and bolt off, you will need to put them back in. Place the screw part of the knob through both holes on the metal clasp. Once you have it through, place the bolt at the end of the screw. Start tightening the knob and bolt until the outer hoop closes and you can't tighten it anymore.

, Try to cut as close to the hoop as possible.

, Choose some ribbon that matches your earring holder, and cut it. Thread it through the metal closure, right under the screw, and tie the ends in a knot.


To hide the knot, rotate the ribbon until the knot is at the bottom. It will rest inside the closure, between the screw and the hoop.

, You can now stick earrings through the tulle or lace. This works best with hook earrings.

Gather your materials.,
Cut your wire.,
Bend your wires to form a flat loop.,
Add your beads.,
Make a loop into your right side wire.,
Wrap both side wires into a coil.,
Hook each of your earrings onto an earwire.",How to Make Drop Earrings2," For these earrings, you will need 22 gauge wire, small wire cutters, jeweler's pliers, French hook earwires, and rondelle cut beads.While specialty jeweler's pliers will be easier to work with, any other type of round nose pliers will also work fine. Other small pliers will do in a pinch.
Rondelle beads are small, round, flat beads typically used as spacers in beaded jewelry. They can be made of anything from glass to precious gemstones. Pick one to three colors to work with.
Depending on the exact size of your rondelle beads, you'll be using about three per earring.

, Unravel a small piece of your wire from its spindle. Straighten it out so you can get an accurate measurement. Measure out four inches of wire for each earring and cut using your wire cutters., For each earring, use your fingers to bend a length of wire so that it forms an oval or teardrop shape.Have the two ends cross at the top into a V-shape. The entire wire should now resemble a fish.

, Slide your beads of choice onto each wire loop. Add only about as many will fit on the bottom edge of the teardrop. This will be about three rondelle beads., Use your pliers to hold the right side wire. Twist it gently to form a loop. Fold the right side wire underneath the left.

, Using your fingers, wrap your right side wire around the crossing point twice. Trim off the small portion of right side wire that remains. Then, wrap your left side wire around the crossing point from top to bottom. At this point, your earring should be made up of two loops separated by a short, tight coil. Your beads will be at the free end of a much larger loop opposite a tiny, more circular one., Use your pliers to gently open up each earwire's small circular fastener (its jump ring). Hang each of your earrings onto an open fastener by its smaller loop. Use your pliers to close the earwires back up, and you now have a finished set of handmade earrings.

Apply glue to the earring flatback.,
Press earring décor onto the earring flatback.,
Allow glue to dry.",How to Make Stud Earrings1," Making stud earrings is easy once you have assembled your materials. Check out your local craft store for earring flatbacks, earring décor pieces, and jewelry glue. Before you get started, you will need:Stud earring flatbacks
Earring décor pieces, such as beads, buttons, pennants, etc.
Jewelry glue (or super glue)
Paper towels
Toothpick;
, Use the toothpick to apply a dot of glue to the stud earring flatback. You don’t need a large amount of glue, just enough to cover the surface of the earring flatback.Superglue also works if you are in a hurry. If using superglue, then you can apply the earring glue directly onto the earring flatback with the tube. Only use a small amount and be careful not to get any on your skin or other surfaces.
Be sure to work over a paper towel to avoid getting glue onto your table and other surfaces.

, Take the piece you want to mount on the earring back and press it onto the glue on the earring flatback. Hold the pieces firmly together for a minute to give them a chance to bond. Then, place the earring on your paper towel to dry the rest of the way.If the earring piece you have added has a flat surface, such as a button or flat pennant, then place the earring face down rather than on its side.

, Leave the earrings alone to dry for a few hours or overnight. It is important to let them dry completely before you wear them.If you used superglue, then your earrings will be ready after just a few minutes. However, you may still want to leave them be for up to an hour to let the glue dry and bond completely.

Try using old jewelry.",How to Make Stud Earrings2," Craft stores are the best place to find all kinds of different beads, buttons, and other cool things to make into stud earrings. Look for items that have a flat surface on one side. This will make it much easier to attach the items to the earring flatbacks.


If using buttons for your earrings, you may want to paint over the button with some clear nail polish before gluing it onto the stud flatback. This will make the button shiny if it is a matte button.Let the nail polish dry completely before gluing it onto the stud.

, If you want to create your own beads to glue onto the earrings, then clay beads are a great option. Try getting some air drying clay in your local craft store and then shape the clay into bead to glue onto your earring flatbacks. You can use multiple colors of clay to create interesting designs in the clay.

, Look for ribbon that is narrow enough to tie into a small bow. Then, tie two equal length pieces of ribbon into bows and glue them onto the earring flatbacks.

, If you want to make a special pair of earrings for a holiday, such as St Patrick’s day, Halloween, or Christmas, then you can look for holiday themed pieces to glue onto stud earring flatbacks. Craft stores are the best place to find these kinds of items.


For example, you could glue a four leaf clover charm onto an earring flatback for St. Patrick’s Day, or glue a jack-o-lantern piece onto an earring flatback for Halloween. You can make yourself a pair of holiday themed stud earrings for every holiday of the year!

, If you don’t want to buy any new beads or other notions to turn into earrings, then you can also convert your old, unwanted jewelry into stud earrings. Try taking apart old necklaces and bracelets and using the beads and charms to create stud earrings.


Be sure that you no longer want the item and that it is something you can break apart before you try to harvest the beads and charms from a piece of jewelry.
Use scissors to cut the string holding the beads and charms together.
Break apart the old jewelry over a bowl or other container to ensure that the beads do not go everywhere.

Choose the jeweler.,
Educate yourself about diamonds.,
Select the style.,
Match the personality.,
Read earring guides.,
Choose the setting.,
Match the hairstyle.,
Do restrict yourself to buying online unless, for whatever reason, you have to.",How to Choose Diamond Earrings," Check for customer reviews on the site; ensure that it is a reputed jeweler. Diamond earrings from a reputed jeweler will provide you the certification issued by GIA or the equivalent body where you live. And so you will be assured of the quality of the earrings and you will be also assured that you are getting the best deal in diamond earrings.;
, Develop an understanding of the Four Cs of diamonds. The 4Cs of diamond are very important since they determine the quality and price of diamond. Color is the tint of diamond and today you can find many fancy colored diamonds but white diamond is very popular and generally most people prefer white diamond for their earrings. Clarity refers to the inclusions and flaws of diamond. Always remember that you usually cannot see these flaws with naked eyes. Carat is the weight of your diamond in the earrings. Cut refers to the quality of the shape of diamond. The most popular cuts for stud earrings are round and princess.

, If it is plain diamond studs, a lot of online jewelers offer them in a few easy steps. A few clicks, quick choices, and you are done. But then, that’s missing out on the fun and creativity.


Beginning from simple diamond studs, you have whole range like semi hoops, hoops, chandeliers, designer earrings, and colored diamond and diamonds with gemstones. Semi hoops give the appearance of hoops, but are the more affordable alternative. Chandeliers are definitely for those special occasions. Studs can be for daily wear and double up for evening wear.

, Remember that the personality of the wearer dictates the choice significantly. And then, are these earrings meant to be worn occasionally, or on a daily basis? Women who wear subtle jewelry on a daily basis may appreciate something dressier for evening wear.

, A lot of guides on earring buying are available. Based on personality and face shape, earrings need to be chosen with care. Always remember oval faces can wear any style but round faces look good with longer earrings.

, Another thing which you must consider is the setting for your diamond earrings. You can choose your earrings in a variety of precious metals. You can select silver, gold or platinum earrings or you can even go with chandelier or hoop earrings in alloys. But if the skin is sensitive then you must avoid alloys. Platinum is best for sensitive skin.

, Keep the hairstyle and size of the ear in mind. Petite women look better in earrings that add length but a short woman will be enveloped with chandeliers. A tall woman needs stud earrings and dangling hoops. Avoid earrings which are too heavy or large for the earlobes. If you are selecting the earrings for regular use then lightweight trendy patterns are best option for you.

, Go to jewellery store and antique shops to look for different styles."

Find a coin that’s at least 80% silver.,
Place your coin on a solid pounding surface, such as an anvil.,
Begin tapping gently along the perimeter of the coin with a hammer.,
Drill a hole in the center with a power drill.,
Enlarge the hole with the rounded needle file, and begin filing along the inside.,
Try on the ring.,
Sand the ring to make it smooth.,
Polish your ring.,
Wear and maintain your new ring.",How to Make a Ring from a Silver Coin," This first step is very important, because a coin with a low silver percentage mixed with other metals will make for a discolored ring.American quarters made before 1964 are 90% silver, while quarters dated 1965 and later are mixed with copper and nickel.Because of their silver percentage, pre-1965 quarters make excellent rings.


Feel free to use other coins, just make sure to Google them beforehand and find out what percentage of silver they are. There are lots of coins to choose from on sites like eBay.
The larger the coin, the thicker the ring. A quarter is a great size, but half dollars may actually work better for someone with larger fingers, or someone desiring a thicker band.It is perfectly legal to make rings out of U.S. coins, despite what many people think.;
, It’s important that the surface is smooth and sturdy, so the coin does not become warped. Don't worry if you don't have an anvil, because any hard metal surface will do just fine. The surface should be somewhere comfortable, because you will be working on it for a good while.

, It is important to tap and not pound on the coin, or your ring will become distorted. Roll the coin on the hard surface as you tap along the edge. The ring will slowly start to get smoothand will begin “mushrooming” out. In other words, the perimeter of the ring will start to widen as you tap, and a lip will form along the sides of the coin. This step of the process will take you the longest. You should notice the lip forming after about fifteen minutes of tapping, and it can take up to an hour for the ring to be as wide as you'd like.


Continue tapping along the side until the width of the lip is the desired width of the ring. This will take a long time, so turn on the television or some music and make yourself comfortable.
A good measure of your progress is to watch the writing along the perimeter of the ring. Slowly but surely, that writing should move to the inside of the lip., Use a small drill bit for this task, with a 1/8” or 3/16” diameter. Be very careful to line up your drill with the center of the coin, so that you don’t butcher the hard work you’ve done tapping the edges out.However, the hole does not need to be perfect— just make it big enough so that you can fit the rounded needle file into it. Once your file can slide into the coin, put your drill to the side.

, It’s easier to hold the file steady and move the ring along the file, rather than trying to hold the ring steady and move the large file. Continue doing this as the hole becomes larger and larger, and the bumps and ridges inside the ring begin to smooth out. It will probably take you about half an hour to get your ring as smooth as you’d like. , Do this repeatedly as you file down the hole to ensure it’s the correct size. The great thing about making your own ring is making sure it’s the perfect fit. Don’t file away at the hole mindlessly, or you will end up with a ring that slides right off your finger.


If you accidentally end up with a ring that is too big, don’t worry. There are plenty of tricks you can use to make it stay on your finger. One thing you can do is to line the inside of the ring with a silicone adhesive. Once it dries, it will fit snugly on your finger., Buy several sheets of tough sandpaper your local hardware store, and sand along the inside and outside of your ring. Sand until your ring is exactly how you like. This will probably take you about half an hour.It may be helpful to start sanding with a medium grit sandpaper (60 to 100 grit range) and gradually move up to the extra fine sandpaper (up to 600 grit range).During this step, you can also use a buffing attachment on your drill to speed up the process and make your ring as smooth as can be.

, After a little cleaning, your new ring will shine. Grab your silver polish and put it on a silver-polishing cloth or rag. Rub it on the outer surface and inner surface of the ring. After you’ve adequately rubbed the polish on the ring, rinse it in cool water. Dry it with a soft cloth.If you do not have silver polish handy, try one of these methods. Alternate methods include soaking your ring in a salt bath with aluminum foil, rubbing it with toothpaste, or scrubbing it with a paste made of water and baking soda.

, Slip it on and let the compliments roll in. No one will believe that you created it yourself, and definitely not out of a common quarter. Daily wear can affect the appearance of your ring, so make sure you keep your ring looking bright and new by polishing it regularly.There are several tips to maintain your ring. Store it separately from other jewelry to prevent tarnishing, take it off when you’re working with cleaning supplies or cosmetics, and take it off before you shower. Soap and other chemicals can cause a build-up on the ring, making it appear grimy and dull."

Clean the ring thoroughly.,
Use a coffee stir stick to apply silicone sealant inside the ring.,
Smooth the silicone with the coffee stir stick.,
Let the silicone cure.",How to Resize a Ring1," Soak the ring in a solution of hot water and dishwashing soap. Use a soft toothbrush to brush the metal and any stones set on the ring.


Dry the ring thoroughly before moving on.
Avoid using cleaners with bleach, acetone or chlorine, as these can damage a ring’s metal band.;
, Make sure to use clear silicone, like food grade or aquarium grade silicone. You’ll want the bottom part of the ring to have the thickest application. Unless the ring is very loose on your finger, you should use a small amount of silicone., As the silicone will be directly against your skin, you’ll want to try to smooth it out as much as possible. Run the stick along the inside of the ring until the silicone smooths out.You can use a wet paper towel to clean any silicone that gets on the outside of the ring.

, Depending on the type of silicone you use, this can take anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. Resist the temptation to wear your ring during this time, as it will take longer for the silicone to cure and might dislodge it entirely.If you need to remove the silicone, you simply need to scratch at it with your fingernail.

Lubricate the ring with soap and slide it onto a ring mandrel.,
Gently tap the ring with a wooden mallet or jeweller’s hammer.,
Remove the ring from the mandrel and try it on.",How to Resize a Ring2," You can use bar soap or dishwashing soap. Make sure the ring is evenly coated before sliding it on the mandrel.A ring mandrel is a graduated metal cone, which is used to size rings. You can easily obtain them from general online retailers.

, Your strikes should be gentle yet firm. Strike at a downward angle; you’re essentially trying to move the ring further down the mandrel. Make sure to turn the ring as you strike, to evenly stretch it.If you have access to it, use a vice to secure the mandrel. This will make this step much easier.
If you only have access to a carpenter’s hammer, you should cover the ring with a soft cloth to prevent damage to the band.

, If it’s still too tight, you can repeat the process, placing the ring on the mandrel and hammering until it fits. Keep in mind this method can only stretch a ring about half a size.If the ring is struck, you can strike upwards with the mallet to dislodge it.

Put on the ring and mark the center of the band.,
Cut the ring along the mark with a pair of wire cutters.,
Gently bend the ring open with the flat nose pliers.,
File the cut edges.,
Try the ring on to check the size.",How to Resize a Ring3," Don't force it on; it’s fine if the ring sits above the knuckle at this point. Use a marker to mark the underside of the ring along the center.

, You can either use dedicated wire cutters, or pliers with a cutting edge. Set them along the line you drew on the ring. Apply pressure smoothly to ensure an even cut.

, Bend both sides of the ring to keep it as even as possible.

, Ideally, you’ll want to use a metalworking file. Alternatively, you can use a nail file, but it’ll take longer to file down the ends. You want to make sure the ends are flat so they won’t be able to scratch you.


You can use a nail buffer to smooth the edges after filing them down.

, The ring should fit comfortably but not move on your finger and the open edges shouldn't dig into your finger when you move it.


If the ring is still too tight, remove it and widen it further with pliers.

Mark the center of the ring’s band.,
Cut the ring along the mark with wire cutters.,
File down the cut edges.,
Close the gap and try on the ring.,
Clean up the ring’s cut ends.",How to Resize a Ring4," This will be easier to do while wearing the ring. If it has stones or other markings, make sure they are centered on top of your finger. Then, mark the center of the band under your finger with a marker. Make sure to use a color that will contrast with the ring: black works best for gold and silver.

, You can either use dedicated wire cutters, or pliers with a cutting edge. Set them along the line you drew on the ring. Apply pressure smoothly to ensure an even cut.

, It’s best to use a file specifically for metal work; otherwise ensure the nail file you use is made of metal. File slowly, only removing a bit of metal at a time., Put the ring inside the open pliers so the outside curvature runs along the pliers. Carefully squeeze, bringing the cut ends of the ring together. Keep the pressure even to make sure the ring keeps its circular shape.Try on the ring after closing the gap. If it’s still too loose, file the cut ends a bit more and try the ring on again.

, Use a buffing block, which you can get from any beauty store, to smooth out the ring’s ends. This will keep the edges from scratching your finger.


Alternatively, you can use a propane torch and jeweller’s solder to close the ring into a single loop.

Cut off the excess wire.,
Open the loop slightly.,
Close the loop.",How to Make Pearl Earrings," Real pearls should have a slightly rough surface that creates friction. They will also not be perfectly round.Make sure the pearls you are using are the size and shape you’re looking for. They’ll also need a hole to run the pin through them.;
, If you need to clean your pearls, there are effective and easy ways of doing that without damaging the pearls. You’ll need designated jewelry cleaner and a soft cloth. Avoid ammonia, harsh chemicals, ultrasonic cleaners, toothbrushes and other abrasives.Use only jewelry cleaners specifically labeled as safe for pearls.

, This is not absolutely necessary but very helpful. Assembling both earrings together will make it easier for you to do each step, particularly when you’re new to the process. This also tends to make each step for one earring consistent with the each step for its matching earring.

, Don’t forget to wear safety goggles as well to protect your eyes. You’ll also need two headpins, two French hook earring wires, round nose pliers, and wire cutters. Headpins and earring wires are available at craft stores or art supply outlets.


Headpins are straight pins that have a ball or a flat circular surface at one end to stop a pearl or bead from sliding off. Decide whether you want a flat or balled end, and whether you’d like a silver or brass/gold-colored pin.
French hook earring wires are long, curved hooks that go through the ear and hang on their own; they don’t require an earring back.

, It should not slide off the other side, but be held in place by the flat head or ball head of the pin.So, let the pearl slide to that side of the headpin.

, Bend close to the pearl, just about a half centimeter above it. Use your hands to bend the pin above the pearl at approximately an 80 degree angle.

, Grip the bent wire with round nose pliers directly above the pearl.

, Start making a loop by bending the headpin clockwise around the tip of the round nose pliers. Adjust your pliers if you need to.

, The loop should not be very large. It should wrap nicely around the round nose pliers so that it’s just the circumference of the end of the pliers.

, Use wire cutters to cut off the extra wire that does not form part of the loop. Cut above the loop so that just the loop is remaining. Always protect your eyes with safety goggles when cutting wire.

, Using your round nose pliers, open the loop just enough to slide the French hooks onto the loop.

, Re-close the loop completely to prevent the hooks from slipping out. All finished!

Choose good feathers.",How to Make Feather Earrings1," While the feathers you use are a personal choice, they should be pretty or elegant to look at and in excellent condition. If you're purchasing them, they'll be guaranteed clean and in good condition. If you're finding your own from a walk in the local woods or from your own birds, they should be cleaned first to disinfect them and to remove any dirt, etc.

",How to Make Feather Earrings2," Locate the holes towards the tops of the feathers, but not too close to the edges (otherwise they risk ripping).;
, Use the pliers for this part; if you have two pairs, you can hold the ring in one pair and use the other pair to open it up.

, There should be two rings for each feather, to allow for some room between the hook and the feather itself.

, You should now have two feathers ready to be attached to the French hooks.

Hang the earrings onto the earring findings and enjoy your new cupcake jewellery.

",How to Make Cupcake Earrings," See the ""Things You'll Need"" list below. Choose which colors you want to use for the earrings. For the earrings shown in this how-to, a brown clay was used for the cupcake base and a white clay for the whipped cream.;
, Make them as big or as little as you want.

, These should mimic the little ridges often seen on cupcake cups.


If everything turns out okay, you should have something like the picture on the right. Make as many or as few indents as you'd like.







, You will use this to make the whipped cream on top of the cupcake. Start on the outside rim of the cupcake and curl the string up and around until you reach the center; try to get it to look like the whipped cream on the cupcakes shown. Repeat for the other cupcake.


Don't fuss over this. Real whipped cream doesn't always look perfect when you spray it on a cupcake - and little imperfections give your earrings character.







, They should be long enough to go from the top to the bottom of the cupcakes while still leaving a little loop on top.

,, Lay a cookie sheet on an oven tray, place the cupcakes on it and then bake according to the instructions on the polymer clay package.


After the cupcakes have finished baking, remove from the oven and let them cool.
After they have cooled, apply a small amount of heavy-duty craft glue where the wire meets the clay. Otherwise the cupcake charms will fall off after a few wears. You can glaze them to give them a shiny finish.

Find two dragonfly connectors or jewelry pieces with a loop attached.

,
Draw out a design for attaching the dragonflies to the earrings.,
Bring the design together by tightening the hooks and loops in place where needed.",How to Make Dragonfly Earrings2,", The most usual approach to adding dragonfly connectors to earrings is to create dangling or cascade earrings. Here are some suggested design layouts:


Place the dragonfly connector at the base, use a fine wire chain to lead up to the earring hook. Along the chain, attach beads in colors that represent your favorite dragonflies. You might also decide to add a bead between the hook and the chain.
Make a simple beaded loop. Attach through the dragonfly connector loop and attach to the earring hooks.
Attach the dragonfly to the earring hook and create a cascade of beads or chain to a single large bead beneath the dragonfly.
It's recommended that you draw out the design first, then assemble it on a jewelry board to see what it looks like before attaching anything together.

, Use pliers to ensure strength. Once the cascade is assembled, the dragonfly earrings are ready to wear.

Use medium gauge, lightweight wire to create this simple wire dragonfly.,
Decide on the length of the earrings before proceeding.,
Using pliers, twist the wire into a small circle loop at one end.,
Assemble approximately 5 medium sized beads along the length of the wire so that they sit on the tail loop.,
Create the wings.,
Continuing with the same piece of wire, straighten it up again.,
Finish off the piece by creating a small circle as you did at the beginning to form the loop for the hook and to prevent the head bead from falling off.,
Repeat for the second earring.

,
Add the earring hooks to each earring.",How to Make Dragonfly Earrings3," For the beads, larger sized beads are best, especially to create the head; if you use seed beads for the body, you'll need quite a few more than using larger beads., More beads means more weight, so take this into account when working out how many beads to use for the body length.

, This will be the ""tail"" end of the dragonfly and will prevent the beads from sliding off.

, You can use more or less beads depending on the size and type of beads you're using.

, To do this:


Bend a small loop to the right first, then cross over the middle and bend a small loop to the left of the same size. This will form the two lower, smaller wings.
Continuing from the lower left wing, cross over and create a larger loop on the right hand side to make the upper right wing. Then bring the wire back and make a final large loop of the same size on the left side to create the large upper left wing.
Bring the end of the wire to the middle of the dragonfly wings and loop right around to create a wire knot.

, Slide one large bead on to create the head of the dragonfly.

, Don't close this circle; the earring hook needs to slip into it.

,, The earrings are now ready to wear.

Choose a suitable polymer clay.,
Decide which approach to take to making the dragonfly earrings.,
Assuming you've decided to model the clay into the shape of a dragonfly, do the following:


Begin with the body and make an elongated shape.,
Assuming you've decided to make the punch-out version, do as follows:


Shape a neat small circle in the size you consider will be comfortable to wear.",How to Make Dragonfly Earrings4," Decide whether you'd like to have clip on backs or studs, or use earring hooks.

, Here are some suggestions:


Model the clay into the shape of a dragonfly
Punch out the shape of a dragonfly in a circle of polymer clay; a twist on this is to punch out the shape in a different color and reinsert the different color into the punched out of the circle. This method requires a small punch in the shape of a dragonfly or some kind of improvised wire cutter in the shape of a dragonfly.

, One end should have a bulbous top for the head, while the rest should taper down finely to represent the back of the dragonfly. Take your time, as shaping it can be tricky but keep in mind that you will not get a delicate shape using polymer, so treat this as creating a resemblance or even a caricature of a dragonfly.
Shape the wings on each side of the body. Each side should have a pair of wing, a top wing and a base wing.
For eyes, either add two tiny balls of polymer clay to the ball head or simply poke two holes into the head.
Shape two small feelers at the top of the head.
Repeat to make the second earring.
Pierce a small hole into the upper body end of the dragonfly where the earring hook will be placed.
Bake according to the instructions accompanying the packaging.
Once baked, remove from the oven and allow to cool. When cooled, slip the earring hook through the hole and the dragonfly earrings are ready to wear.

,
Center the dragonfly punch or improvised cutting shape over the circle and punch out the dragonfly shape. If you are going to leave this as a hole, you can proceed to bake.
If adding a differently colored dragonfly center, punch out the shape from the other-colored polymer clay first. Then, gently push in the piece into the hole you've already punched out of the circle. You may find this a bit tricky and it's very important to do it carefully and slowly to avoid bleeding of the design colors into each other. Use a fine tool to help you, such as tweezers, rather than your fingers. Proceed to bake as instructed.
Repeat for the second earring.
Pierce a small hole into the upper body end of the dragonfly where the earring hook will be placed.

, Hit the head of the nail with a hammer. You will be punching the hole from the inside.

, The flat head part of the pin should be inside the cap. You can find these types of pins in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. They are long, and easily bent., You won't need a lot of beads. One to three small beads will do. Choose colors that match the design on your bottle cap. Here are some ideas to get you started:


If you are adding one bead, match it to the background color of the bottle cap, or the letters.
If you are using 2 beads, match the bottom one to the letters, and the top one to the background.
If you are using three beads, match the top and bottom beads to the background. Match the middle bead to the letters.

, Use your jewelry pliers to take hold of the shaft, as close to the beads/bottle cap as possible. Bend the shaft until it is at a 90 degree angle.

, Use your wire cutters to do this.

, Grip the very end of the shaft with a par of round-nose jewelry pliers. Twist the shaft into a loop. Don't close it all the way.

, If you are having troubles getting the loop closed all the way, try pulling it a little bit towards you, and pulling it until it meets the shaft. Then, push the loop back towards the shaft to flatten it, soft of like closing a jump ring.

, If you are using beads, make sure that they match your first earring.

If your bottle cap came with a plastic liner inside, you will have to remove it. Click here to find out how.

, Slip an open jump ring. You can then slip chains onto the jump ring. To add beads, slip some beads onto a head-pin instead, then slip the end of the pin through the hole; twist the end of the pin into a loop (inside the bottle cap) to hole it in place., Before you do anything, drop the bottle caps into a pot of boiling water. Wait until the plastic liner begins to curl up, then pull the bottle cap out with a spoon. Drop the cap onto a paper towel, then quickly pull the plastic liner out.


If there is any liner residue, you can either pop the cap back into the boiling water, or try to scrape it out using a craft knife.Bottle caps cool off quickly, but the water left on them may not. Be careful.

Once you've done that, unfold the paper so you can move on to the exciting next step.

, This will create four flaps on each side. Just to make sure that's clear, it's one one-inch cut along each crease. These flaps will be used to keep the pockets together.








, Fold them toward the paper, toward you. Leave the paper facing you the tall way.








, They should be about 1/8"" apart. In other words, you know the bottom two boxes of the page? Draw two lines right by the crease, really close to each other.








, It should look like a stop sign that you're viewing from the side (the narrow diamond is the top and the two lines are the post). This will be where you can slide credit cards, business cards or cash into.









Just to be clear, your two lines go along the entirety of the bottom quarter and the diamond goes along the entirety of the second-to-last quarter.

In that case, you'll just have to be careful how hard you pull on each stitch.,, Some stitches such as French Knots work best with the full 6 strands of thread normally found in Embroidery floss. Finer details will require using fewer strands at a time to accomplish the effect desired. A common number of strands is two, but you should use your own best judgment., Both methods have their advantages. Dark thread first prevents getting your lighter colors dingy with repeated rubbing and holding of the piece during stitching. Working out from the center has the advantage of being adjusted as you go. (starting at the outside will restrict any changes you can make later.), Even the gentlest of tugs on the embroidery floss can pucker the fabric and make the backpack pucker and look weird when you're finished.,,"

, Use warm soapy water to clean out leftover cream, lotion or other contents. Allow to dry thoroughly before proceeding.
, Check if it is a good size for a coin purse (have a coin handy to help you test this). If the tube is not the right size, find a larger tube to use.

, Draw a line down the edge of the folded tube to the fold line.

, Follow the images for guidance.

Clip the container together to assist with cutting. Then cut out the edges as shown.





Remove the clip and bend back the top portion after cutting to make a fold line, as shown.





Then pinch the tube together at the fold line, as shown. This will form a triangular base and the cut ends will stand upright.





Still holding the pinched piece in place, cut across one side of the tube at the fold line, ending in the middle. You are only going to cut off one side.






Discard the cut-away portion.






You will be left with the basic purse shape.







, Then fold it over the base of the purse to check the length. It is likely too long, so you'll need to snip off excess:


Cut off the excess in a nice shape, such as curved, as you'd expect to see on a purse.






Tidy up the base as well by snipping off any unwanted excess.






, Mark it lightly. Then use a hole puncher to punch a neat hole at that spot.


How it looks when done:







, This is a bill clip for those times when you add folded notes. See the image for details.

Squeeze the tube together.





Cut a small V shape as shown.





Push out just a little to check it sits correctly.






, The bead will need to be large enough to keep the purse flap closed over it, so measure the bead against the hole you've punched in the flap.
, Use price tag thread to thread the bead in place where the clasp hole will fold down onto:

Pierce a small hole and push the thread through at the clasp end.





Gently burn the end that you've pushed through to form a small knot. Use a lighter for this and do it quickly. This knot will prevent the thread from coming back through the hole you've pierced for the thread's entry.






Thread the bead onto the purse flap. This is done simply by threading the bead on and knotting it in place with a gentle, quick lighter burn on the thread. Cut off any excess thread.

, Then thread on the bead. Burn the invisible thread into a small knot.
, The final look is quite spectacular.

,,, As you weave, switch from under, over, under, over, to over, under, over, under, for every strip of magazine.

, It should end up looking similar to the outcome shown in this image.

, You can use the back of and old spiral notebook, inserts from calendars, or just cut a shape to size from a used cereal box.

, Then, tape the ends that overlap the cardboard to the back of the cardboard.

, Tape it on the back to cover up the taped edges and the cardboard itself. It's recommended that you add clear tape to this side too, just to strengthen it and to prevent it from being torn when objects are slipped inside the bag.

, When you've finished one piece, as outlined in the preceding steps, you can decide if you want to make your bag square or rectangular.


If you want it square then make four more side pieces following the same steps.
If you want it rectangular then make one more side following the same steps and three sides following the same steps but in steps instead of the five and six pieces outlined above, make five and nine or eight and nine pieces.

, Just use clear duct tape to tape the entire bag together.


If you intend carrying this rather than using it for storage purposes, consider adding handles. For handles, use anything scrap such as ribbon, plaited twine, a strap off a broken bag, etc. The handle can be attached by stapling, tying, punching in metallic rings and then attaching, etc. Choose the method that works best for your needs.

",How to Make a Book Purse," Used book stores, library book sales, and thrift stores are good places to find a tome that will suit this purpose.

Look for something with an attractive cover in a color that suits your (or your recipient's) style. Some old books are bound with leather (or a lookalike) and embossed.
Look around for textbooks, mismatched/outdated encyclopedias, Reader's Digest Condensed Books or anything that you think will be worth more for its cover than its contents.;
, You can use scissors or a craft knife. Open the cover and cut along the gutter (crease) line.





 Empty cover, ready to become a purse.

If you like, hang onto the pages or part of them for use in a collage or other paper crafts. Text, even if it's nothing in particular, can lend character to craft projects, and things like old encyclopedias can be great sources of images and inspiration. You can also cut out text to glue onto the cover of the book- the name of the person, etc.

, Heavy mailing envelopes work fine., Cut slightly INSIDE your tracing lines so that you get a cardboard rectangle that is just slightly smaller than your book cover(s).,,, This will support and reinforce the bottom of your new purse.,, You may starch the fabric to make it stiffer and easier to use if you like., Lay the cardboard on the cloth and cut around it, leaving an inch or so in every direction.,,






Fold a quarter yard (23cm) of fabric into quarters (fold once along a vertical centered fold line, then once along a horizontal fold line). You should end up with a rectangular shape, with folds on two adjacent edges and four layers of material.
Measure and mark the following:






One spine width from the corner where the two folded edges meet, along the edge with two folds. This measurement is shown by the red line in the previous diagram.
One book cover width from the corner where the folded edges meet, down either of the longest sides. This measurement is shown by the blue line in the previous diagram.
A diagonal line from the end of the first measurement to the end of the second measurement.











 Blue line is the folded edge. The red line is a folded edge that should be cut to separate the triangle(s) from each other.

Cut the triangles from the markings you made.






You should now have two triangles that measure as follows:
A = twice the spine width.
B = the length of the short side (width) of the book cover.
C = the distance that you want your book purse to open up.
Repeat the process to make two more triangles with these dimensions, making for a total of four triangles.

, (see photo for pointers), Right sides together.,,,, Stitch up the fold at least an inch. This will help your purse to close cleanly without the fabric bunching outward., You may glue the fabric to the front side if you wish as well., Be certain that the dart lies to the inside of the cover.

Consider using some extra trim, such as ribbon or braided cord.Cut it down to the length you want, then glue the bottom ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) to the top inside edge of each cup.

,
Add a final touch.",How to Make a Bra Purse," Most people find that a B or C cup works best. A strapless bra, or a bra with removable straps, will give you less work and a nicer finish in the end.The bra doesn't have to be new, but it should be clean and in good condition.
Avoid push-up bras. They have too much padding, and you won't have enough room inside.;
, Use a pair of fabric scissors to cut the back straps off. Follow the curve of the wire so that no straight edges remain. If your bra has removable shoulder straps, unhook them now. If your bra has regular shoulder straps, cut them off at the seam., Most bras will have a little tab in the middle connecting the two cups. You will need to cut this off for a smoother finish. Once again, follow the curve of the underwire so that the connecting material does not show. Discard the little tab you just cut off.

, While not completely necessary, this can take your bra purse to the next level by making it look more like a purse and less like a bra. Choose some ribbon, beaded fringe, or tassel fringe, and measure it along the underwire. Cut the trim to fit.


You can use the same color as your bra or a nice coordinating color.

, Flip one of your bra cups over so that the inside is facing you. Draw a line of hot glue or fabric glue along the underwire. Quickly press the hem of the fringe into the glue. Make sure that the tassel part of the fringe is sticking out from under the bra cup.

, Draw another line of glue along the other cup's underwire. Place the two cups together. Make sure that they align, then pinch your fingers along the bottom of both cups, sealing them together.

, You can attach extras, such as lace, appliqués, or bows to your bra purse using hot glue or fabric glue. You can also stitch them on by hand using a needle and thread.


For a fancier touch, glue a ruffled trim along the top each of each bra cup.
Layer your trim. Glue down some ruffled lace trim first, then glue down some skinny ribbon along the top hem.
Cut embroidered or bridal lace trim into shapes, and use those as appliqués.
Don't get too carried away. Less is often times more!

, Choose a thin, decorative trim, such as rickrack, braided cording, or sequins. Measure it across the bottom/underwire of your purse. Double the length, then cut the trim accordingly.

, Draw a line of glue along the bottom edge of the purse, right along the underwire. Press the final trim into the glue. Flip the bra purse over, and finish gluing the trim on the other side., A ribbon closure works great with a bra purse because of how dainty and feminine it is. Velcro closures are more practical, but less pretty. Choose one of the closure methods from below for your purse.

, Cut two pieces of skinny ribbon. Heat seal both ends by holding them near a flame until the raw edges melt. Glue the end of one ribbon to the top-center of one bra cup. Repeat with the other ribbon for the other bra cup. Tie the ribbons together into a bow to close the purse.


For extra security, tie a small knot into the end of each ribbon first. Glue the knot to the inside of the purse., Buy some self-adhesive Velcro dots. Get white if you have a light colored bra or black if you have a dark colored bra. Peel off two matching dots, then stick them to the inside of each bra cup along the top-center edge.Sometimes, self-adhesive Velcro dots don't stick very well. If they keep falling off, use hot glue or fabric glue to attach them instead.

, Get two flat, silver-colored magnets. These magnets are much stronger than the typical black ones. Glue each magnet to the top-center inside edge of each bra cup. Measure across the top edge of your bra purse, and cut two pieces of ribbon according to that length. Coat the back of each ribbon with glue, then stick it to the inside top-edge of each cup. This will cover the magnet, help it stick better, and give you a nice trim on the inside.


The ribbon needs to be wide enough to cover the magnet.

, A closer it not mandatory for a bra purse. If you don't want a closure, you can leave it off entirely. This is a great option if you are using your purse to store potpourri.

, You can reuse the bra straps, or you can use ribbon, lace, cord, or even a chain. The options are limitless! Choose one of the options below.

, Punch a hole into the top-center of each bra cup. Set a grommet into each hole using a grommet setter. Open up two large jump rings, and hook them onto each end of your desired chain. Slip the jump rings through the grommets, then close them.


Open and close jump rings using needle nose pliers. Pull the two halves past each other, like a door. Don't pull them away from each other, like a drawer.
If your chain is big enough, weave a skinny ribbon through the links.

, Trim the shoulder straps down to the same length; omit the plastic or metal sliders. Overlap the ends by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and secure with glue. Glue the other ends to the inside of each cup. Glue some extra trim around the seam at the strap, where the two shoulder straps connect.,, This is not completely necessary, but it can really take your bra to the next level. Find two small bows or ribbon roses. Put a dab or hot glue or fabric glue below each strap, right where it connects with the purse. Press your bow or flower into the glue.


Use miniature bows or flowers, like the type used to decorate lingerie. Anything bigger will look tacky.

Secure the straps.,
Cut some fabric for the lining, if desired.,
Sew your lining together.,
Fold the top, raw edge of your lining down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) all the way around.,
Glue the lining into the bag.,
Use your bag with care.",How to Create a Candy Bar Wrapper Purse4," Here is where you can get really creative. You can make your strap out of duct tape, more folded and linked candy wrappers, ribbon, fabric, or nylon backpack strapping. Choose your material, add about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters), then cut it accordingly. You can make one long, shoulder strap, or two short handles. To make a fabric strap:

Decide how wide you want your strap to be, then cut your fabric 4 times as wide.
Fold the fabric in half lengthwise, with the wrong sides together, and press it with an iron.
Fold the raw side edges inside so that they nestle against the fold. Press the strap with an iron again.
Topstitch along the double-folded edge using a sewing machine. Sew as close to the folded edge as possible.

, Plan on having about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the strap inside the bag. Also, make sure that the folded part of your strap is against the bag so that you can't see it. Folding the ends of your straps in hides the raw edges and gives you a cleaner finish. Keeping 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the strap inside the bag adds strength and stability.

If you are making a shoulder strap, pin the ends to the folded side edges of the bag.
If you are making handles, pin them to the flat sides of the bag inside.

, The easiest way to do this would be to simply hot glue them in. You can also sew them in by hand or by using a sewing machine. If you plan on using a sewing machine, sew across the side and bottom edges of your strap, first, then along the top edge of your bag. For extra stability, sew an X into the middle of your strap where it connects to the bag.

Remove the sewing pins when you are done.

, Measure the height and width of your bag, and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. Fold some fabric in half, and cut a square or rectangle out according to your measurement; the folded part of the square will be the bottom of your bag.

If you do not wish to add a lining, your bag is done.

, Make sure that the fabric is folded with the right sides together. Next, sew up the sides of your lining using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) seam allowance. Leave the top edge open., Make sure that you are folding towards the outside, where the side hems are. If you'd like, you can glue or topstitch the top hem down to keep it in place., Set the lining into the bag, and match up the top edges. Draw a short line of hot glue along the top edge of the bag, then immediately press the top edge of the lining into it. Keep doing this until you have glued the lining down.

Hot glue sets quickly. Work 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) at a time.

, Even though this bag is sturdy, it is still fragile and can break if you are not careful. Avoid getting it wet, and do not keep anything too heavy inside of it."

, Insert one 8-mm jump ring through the last link in one end of the 8-inch (20-cm) chain. Insert one 10-mm jump ring through the last link on the other side of the same piece of chain.


Close both jump rings after attaching them to the chain.

, Find the free end of the 10-inch (25-cm) chain and feed it through the 10-mm jump ring attached to the opposite chain.


You'll only need to slide roughly 2 inches (5 cm) through the jump ring.
While not strictly necessary, it may help to hook the clasp into the 8-mm jump ring before working on the ""lariat"" portion of the necklace.

, If the pendant does not have an attached jump ring, insert a 4-mm jump ring through the pendant hole.


You can use nearly any homemade or store-bought pendant for this project, but if you'd prefer a daintier, balanced necklace, opt for a relatively lightweight pendant between 1/2 inch and 2 inches (1.25 cm and 5 cm) tall.
Do not close this jump ring after inserting it through the hole of the pendant.
If the pendant already has an attached jump ring, use your needle-nose pliers to open it from side-to-side.

Keep the crimp bead to the inside of the ring.
Loop the wire end around the ring, then feed it into the crimp bead again.
Carefully squeeze the crimp bead shut using needle-nose pliers. You could also use a bead crimper, but in most cases, the pliers should work well enough.

, Feed anywhere from 12 to 24 decorative beads onto the wire. Stop when only 4 inches (10 cm) of free wire remains.


Round 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) diameter beads work well, but you can use nearly any style and size you'd like. You can also add fewer beads that the amount called for in this project if you would prefer a less ornate necklace.

, Thread one crimp bead and another 10-mm jump ring onto the free end of the wire. Loop the wire around the jump ring and feed it into the crimp bead.


As before, close the crimp bead with your pliers to secure the end.
After closing the end, trim away any excess wire using wire cutters.

, Use your wire cutters to cut two identical lengths of chain.


The overall necklace should be roughly 18 to 20 inches (46 to 51 cm), so determine how much chain you'll need based on the length of your beaded portion.
For 14 inches (36 cm) of beaded wire, two 2.5-inch (6.25-cm) lengths of chain should suffice.

The opening of each chain link must be at least 1/8 inch (3 mm) in order for the ribbon to fit through it.
If desired, you could also make this a longer or shorter necklace by altering the chain length. Keep in mind that a longer necklace will be heavier, though, especially when using such a large chain.

, Unroll 1/8-inch (3-mm) wide polyester ribbon but do not cut it. Begin weaving this ribbon in and out of the links in your length of chain.


Work the ribbon over and under the links, alternating back and forth from link to link. It's best if you weave the chain around each consecutive link, but you could choose to weave it around every other or every third link for a slightly different look.

, Wrap the working end of your ribbon through and around the opening on one side of the buckle charm.


Continue weaving the ribbon through the chain links that now fall behind the charm.
Once you reach the other end of the charm, attach it to the opening at this opposite end, too.

, Continue weaving the ribbon through the remaining links of the chain. Don't stop until you reach the last link.


Pull approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of ribbon through the last link.

, Apply a small dab of tacky glue to the free end of the ribbon, then fold this end over the last chain and onto the ribbon beneath it. Press firmly until the glue holds the ribbon in place.


Trim the other side of the ribbon, leaving approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) tail, and glue it down over the starting link in the same manner.

, Open one 15-mm jump ring and attach it to one side of the chain. Hook a large (20-mm) hook-style clasp onto the jump ring, as well.


Due to the thickness of the jump ring, you may need to use standard needle-nose pliers instead of jewelry pliers.
Use the pliers to open the jump ring from side-to-side. Attach both the chain and clasp, then bend the jump ring closed again.

, Open another 15-mm jump ring and attach it to the opposite side of the chain. Close this jump ring after hooking it on.


This is the jump ring that the clasp should hook into when you put on the necklace.

, The project should be finished, and your new necklace should be ready to wear and enjoy.


When wearing this necklace, make sure that the decorative side of the buckle charm faces outward instead of facing toward your body.

Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut the ribbon down to size.For example, if your neck is sixteen inches around, cut the ribbon to a length of fifteen inches.
Dark shades of velvet were popular for Victorian-era chokers. For instance, black, midnight blue, or burgundy.;
, There are multiple ways to do this. If the ribbon is made of synthetic fiber like acrylic or polyester, you can seal the ends with a flame. If it is a natural fiber (like cotton or silk) – or the material type is unknown – a different method is required, because the fabric would burn rather than melt.In that case, seal the ribbon ends by applying a thin layer of fabric glue or clear nail polish to the edge of each ribbon end.To seal ribbon tips with a lighter, first pour a little bit of water in the bottom of an empty tin can or glass ashtray. Have a pitcher of water beside you for safety. Hold the tip of the ribbon over the can or ashtray. Light the cigarette lighter, and run the flame lightly back and forth against the tip of the ribbon a couple of times. The fabric should melt and quickly air dry hardened. Repeat on the other end of the ribbon.
The ribbon should not catch flame. If it does, try gently blowing the flame out over the container of water. If that doesn’t work, dunk it in the water to extinguish it, and allow it to dry before you continue.

, In keeping with the Victorian era style, choose a pendant such as a metal medallion, cameo, or a large jewel. If the pendant has a bail, you can just slide the ribbon through the bail. If the pendant only has a hole at the top, use jump rings to connect the pendant to the ribbon.You may need to roll the ribbon lengthwise in order to stick it through the hole. Then smooth it back out with your fingers. If it continues to curl, you can gently steam it with a hand steamer or steam iron on the lowest setting at least half an inch away from the fabric. Never allow the iron to touch the velvet.The ribbon will bunch in the center where it’s pinched smaller by the pendant. This is normal and is how velvet chokers typically looked in that era.

, Ribbon clamps are also known as ribbon-end findings. Ideally, your findings should match the width of your ribbon. You can use a ribbon clamp that’s wider than the ribbon, but the ribbon cannot be wider than the clamp.For example, use a 13x6mm finding for a 1/2"" ribbon. Use a 6x5mm finding for a 1/4"" ribbon.

, Using a cotton swab or small paintbrush, spread an adhesive such as E6000 on the inside of the ribbon clamp. Slide the ribbon into the finding, with the clamp’s claw facing the fuzzy side of the ribbon.Use light pressure to clamp the finding down with nylon jaw pliers or needle-nose pliers without teeth. Lay it down and let the glue set for at least two minutes. Then repeat this process on the other ribbon tip.Lay the necklace flat again and allow the glue to set for 24 to 72 hours before continuing.The nylon jaws of the pliers may slide a bit on the finding, so use them gently and carefully. Position the pliers at whatever angles work best to grip the finding.
The finding should be doing most of the gripping, not the glue.

, Hold one pair of non-serrated needle-nose pliers in each hand. Grasp a jump ring on opposite sides with your pliers. Twist one end of the jump ring towards you as you’re twisting the other end away from you, so that you create a small gap.You don’t want to pull the tips of the jump ring apart horizontally. Twist them away from each other instead of pulling them apart to the left and right.

, Put one of the open jump rings through the loop at the end of one ribbon clamp. Slide a fastener, such as a lobster clasp, onto the jump ring as well. Then close the jump ring by gripping pliers in each hand and twisting the jump ring closed.The jump ring should sit flush against itself without a gap. Usually you will hear a little click. You may have to rock the pliers back and forth a little bit until the jump ring closes up.

, Put an open jump ring in the loop of the ribbon clamp that doesn’t have a fastener on it. Loop the necklace extender onto the jump ring as well. Then close the jump ring by twisting it back together with your pliers.

Decide how many rubber bands you'd like per loop.,
Choose the colors.,
Lay the rubber bands out in the pattern and numbers intended.,
Begin making the rubber band necklace.,
Continue until the necklace is formed.,
Done.",How to Make a Rubber Band Necklace1," There should be a minimum of two rubber bands per loop for effect, and you'll probably want to stop after six maximum, or it'll be hard to work with.;
, You might like a single color (all red, all green, all blue, etc.), or maybe you'd like to mix up colors. Decide on single, duo or multi-colors and the pattern before you start making the necklace. Patterns could include:


One color, next color, back to the first color, back to the second color
Three of the same color in a row, then three of the next color in a row, then another three, then return to the same sequence
Rainbow color pattern.

, This will give you a good idea of the final effect and helps you to check that you have enough rubber bands.

,


Pinch the first loop amount in the middle. It will look a little like a bow, with equal amounts either side.
In the center of the pinched loop, tie the next loop. Do this by laying the open loop underneath the pinched loop, then bringing one side of the loop up and into the other side of the loop, capturing the pinched loop in the middle. Pull the second loop up to fully tie the pinched loop in place.
Continue with the remaining loops. Each time, turn the last added loop into a pinched loop, then add the next loop.

, Finish by adding a jump ring; press in place with pliers.

, You can also make a matching bracelet.

"

Choose the colors of both the rubber bands and the paper clips.,
Attach the first rubber band to the first paper clip.,
Attach the next rubber band to the other end of the first paper clip.,
Attach the next paper clip, followed by a new rubber band.,
Put over your head.",How to Make a Rubber Band Necklace2," You can make the colors match, use contrasting colors, or use a rainbow of colors.


Choose small and strong colored rubber bands. If the rubber bands are too big, they will sag and look odd.

, Slide the rubber band in the clip opening, then pull to one end.

, You've now formed the first part.

, Continue in this way until the necklace reaches the desired length.

, Your rubber band and paper clip necklace is now ready for wearing out.

"

Use the large pinkish-colored rubber bands commonly found in offices for large piles of paper.,
Sit a rubber band flat.,
Carefully roll the rubber band into a spiral.,
Hold in place with your fingers.,
Repeat for as many times as you would like to have the spirals on the necklace length.

,
Assemble the necklace.",How to Make a Rubber Band Necklace3," The rubber bands must be wide and of good quality.

, Run a length of glue along one side of the flattened band.

, The glued part should be rolled into.

, Or, place a clothes peg or similar over the roll to hold it in place until it dries firmly.

,, Glue each spiral together in a large circle or oval shape. When you reach the end, try it on for fit. If you're happy with the length, attach a hook and clasp to allow you to open and close the necklace.

"
"
Decide how long you would like the necklace to be.,
Choose a selection of differently colored rubber bands.,
Choose beads.,
Begin forming links to make the necklace chain.,
Open the new ring.,
Repeat.,
Continue until the hole necklace length has been formed.,
Finish with a clasp.,
Try it on.",How to Make a Rubber Band Necklace4," This will affect how many ring links you need, as well as the amount of rubber bands you'll need.

, Variety of colors is a good look for this necklace, although if you'd prefer a one-hued or single-toned necklace, that's fine too.


Choose good quality, medium sized rubber bands.
You will need approximately four to five rubber bands per ring link.
The rubber bands can be all one size, or for more interesting effect, they can form an effect like hooped earrings, with the sizes descending or ascending. The only issue with this is that you must be very careful to align the sizes exactly for every single ring, thus it's a good idea to have a large workspace to assemble each loop set before assembling the necklace.

, The beads are optional but make a nice addition to ""jazz up"" the look of the necklace when completed, giving it a more artsy finish. The beads can be placed every few links, for best effect. Choose either all one color, or complementary colors.


The beads should not be too small or too large. They shouldn't dominate the necklace, nor should they be hard to see.

, Open the first ring link using the pliers. Slip on 4 to 5 rubber bands. Also slip on the next unopened ring. Using the pliers, close the ring. This forms the first chainlet.

, Slip on four to five rubber bands and the next unopened ring. Close the ring.

, Every three to four chainlets, add a bead as well and close it into that specific ring.

, The rubber bands will start to get in your way as you work, so be patient and take it slowly, carefully moving aside prior rubber bands to avoid catching them inside new chainlets.

, This makes it easier to undo and do up the necklace. Be sure to place a bead or two either side of the clasp and to keep the rubber bands well away from this area, as it's easy to catch them up when doing up the necklace.

, The necklace will look quite amazing when worn.

Lay out all your tools.,
Plan your charms.,
String the beads on the headpin.,
Attach using a single loop.,
Finish with a wrapped loop (Optional).",How to Make Charms1," Before getting started, ensure that you have all the appropriate tools. including beads, headpins, pliers, and wire cutters.By having all your tools together, you can prevent the need to run to the craft store in the middle of your work.


Headpins are a tool vital to charm-making. They are skinny pin-like pieces of metal that have one smooth head end. They can be compared to a very tiny nail, or a thinner version of a sewing pin, but with a flat end opposite the head.All your beaded charm supplies will be available at a local craft or dollar store.;
, Once you’ve developed a desired theme for you charms, lay the beads out in the desired pattern.If you’ll be doing more than one charm, position each charm separately from one another. Take time to experiment with the order and positioning of the beads.

, Taking the pre-decided lines of beads, thread them through the headpin.If you are creating a color coordinated pattern with other charms, ensure the correct order is followed.


If doing several charms, thread the beads onto the headpins all at once. This will prevent you from making any mistakes in size, color, style or order of beads., Thread the headpin through your jewellery. Experiment with your desired length from the jewellery to the charm. Using pliers, curve the pin in a circle back towards you, and continue bending away from you. Stop when the headpin has met one single loop.Twist the end of the loop till it is aligned with the beaded-side of the loop.Trim the excess pin if you will be keeping a single loop. If you wish to have a wrapped loop, keep the excess for the time being. If you trim and you find the end of the pin to be poking you, simply mold it towards the inside of the loop.

, If you’re tough on your jewelry, consider adding the wrapped loop. A wrapped loop is added to a single loop by taking the excess wire from the end of the loop and wrapping it neatly down the charm’s side of the pin.Three wraps should be sufficient before trimming off any excess wire. Always tuck the end of the wire in. Wrapped loops will prevent charms from slipping off and give an antique look to your jewelry piece.

Try the magnetic necklace on.",How to Make a Magnetic Necklace," Even some dollar stores carry magnetic beads. Ask to see the magnetic beads and select the size, shape and shade/color of beads you'd like for your necklace.;
, It must be strong and long enough to go around your neck. Always purchase extra string to cover errors.

, Choose a clasp that is suited to the size of the beads and in a color you prefer (usually silver or gold, but can be other colors too).

, If you purchased beads of varying sizes and shapes, use the bead board to arrange a suitable design for the necklace. Bead boards often have an indented circle or oval allowing you to arrange the beads without them rolling off anywhere.

, It's a good idea to put down a non-slip surface, such as a non-slip mat or a silicone sheet.

, This will prevent the first bead from slipping off. Be sure to leave sufficient string end for adding the clasp.

, Follow the pattern you've chosen, if relevant. Otherwise, simply thread on the one-size beads until you reach the length require.


Being magnetic, you should find the beads are quite helpful in staying stuck together once threaded in place.

, Be sure to leave sufficient string end for adding the clasp.

, If you aren't sure how to put the clasp on, ask the retailer at the time of purchase or request instructions. You also check out How to attach a clasp on a cord choker and apply the basics.


Attach each part of the clasp to the string.
Check that the clasp will insert correctly.

Gather your materials.,
Condition enough clay for your charms.,
Shape the clay into the desired shape.,
Add texture to the charm.,
Insert an eyepin.,
Stamp the charm.,
Cure the charms.,
Attach your charm.",How to Make Charms2," Working with clay can be very time sensitive. You don’t want your hard work to go to waste if the clay dries up or ages while you look for your eyepins. Before sitting down to get molding, gather up all required eyepins, jump rings, pliers and polymer clay. If you plan to texture or beautify your charm, make sure to grab your texturing tools such as a toothbrush, stamps or releasing agent you will need.


A releasing agent will prevent the clay from sticking to the stamp as the stamp is pulled away.An eyepin is a small pin used to anchor into your charm. It is thin and long, with one pointy end and the other end molded into a small loop.The loop is the location where you can add a jump ring to connect it to your charm.
A jump ring is another metal piece used to connect an eyepin to jewelry. Jump rings are small, circular rings of metal that can open and close to attach to a charm through the eyepin.You may want to also gather a baking-safe pan or bowl to place your charms into while they cure. Anything oven-safe is appropriate.

, Conditioning is the preparation of clay.To condition, tear off a sufficient amount of clay from your brick. If you wish to mix two colors, now is the time to cut off both amounts. Work both colors in your hands to mix into the desired look. The warmth in your hands will warm the clay up. This will have it conditioned and ready to go for moulding.Try rolling the clay out in a long skinny line. You can also try rolling it up into a sphere, only to squish it down and reroll. Any method works as long as the clay is being worked.The clay will need to be conditioned for up to ten minutes. You’ll start to feel a change in the clay’s consistency once you become more experienced.The clay will be soft and workable when ready. It cannot be over-conditioned, so if you’re unsure, give it a few extra minutes.
If your clay is difficult to shape or is crumbly, it’s likely too old for use.Throw it out and try again.

, When learning to mold, it is usually best to start small and simple. Either take a piece of clay and shape with your fingers, or roll it out to cut it.If you choose to try rolling it out, press it into an even thickness. Using either a cookie cutter or knife, cut out your desired shape.It is recommended to do all shaping on top of the pan you will use for baking the clay. If you’d prefer your charm to be matte instead of shiny, place parchment paper between the pan and the charm., Texturing can take a simple charm and turn it into one that has intricate detail. Get creative when choosing how to texture. Try gently brushing a clean toothbrush across the surface of your charm, or pushing a feather into the charm.Sandpaper can create another interesting texture. Try using a needle or toothpick to add small designs., An eyepin will allow you to thread the charm onto a necklace or add it into a charm bracelet.Look at your charm and determine which way you would like it to hang. Gently press the eyepin in until only the eyelet is visible. If you’re unhappy, you can remove it, reshape your charm, and try again.


Eyepins can also be added after the clay has cured using a drill bit.However, attaching the pin before curing will allow you to experiment with placement.

, If you wish to add a three dimensional stamp to your charm, do so before curing. Wood-mounted, traditional, metal and acrylic stamps can all be used safely with clay.Before stamping, check your alignment twice before applying pressure then gently push the stamp down onto your charm.


If you have a limited supply of stamps, use things from around your home. For example, uncooked alphabet noodles or beads.Consider using a release agent before stamping. Before stamping, simply moisten the stamp with water. Alternatives to water include powders such as cornstarch and baby powder.Always make sure to clean the stamp afterwards.

, Whenever ready, prepare to cure your charms. While they can be air-dried, baking them provides a much more stable and hearty charm. Clay curing temperature and time will be dependent upon the manufacturer but is usually around 275 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius) for 25 minutes.If you’ve lost the packaging for your clay, Google the manufacturer for details. After cooling completely, the charms are ready to be added into your jewelry.


If the charms are light in color, you may wish to decrease the oven temperature by 10 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius) and double the cooking time. This prevents the clay from browning or changing color.When your clay is removed from the oven it will still be soft. Clay does not finish curing until cooled. Do not be tempted to touch the clay, or leave it in the oven longer than recommended., Using a jump ring, open the ring to accommodate sliding the eye pin through. If necessary, use needle nosed pliers to open the ring. After the charm is inserted onto the jump ring through the eye-pin, thread the jump ring onto the rest of the jewelry. When satisfied, use the pliers to gently close the ring.Voila! Enjoy your new charm.


When opening a jump ring, do not pull it open by moving both ends away from another. Instead, open it by twisting the ends side to side. This will aid the ring in keeping its strength."

Cut two more 1-inch (2.5-cm) diameter discs from 26-gauge (0.4 mm) sterling silver sheet.Use a divider tool to mark the shape of all four discs into the sheet metal before cutting out the discs.
If available, use a disc cutter to cut out all four circles. A jeweler's saw can be used when no disc cutter is available, however.
Note that you do not need to trim or file the discs down right now.;
, Working with one disc at a time, place each 20-gauge (0.8 mm) disc into the hollow of a wooden dapping block and punch the metal into a shallow dome.Place the disc in the center of one of the shallow hollows on the block.
Position a wooden dapping punch with a low dome on the front end over the disc. Gently tap the back end of the punch with a mallet to bend the metal. Start around the edges of the disc, then gradually move inward toward the center, working in a spiral motion.
Stop once both domes are 0.18 inch (4.5 mm) thick. Make sure that both domes match each other in height before continuing.

, File the edges of both domes using a large, flat file. Make sure that both domes have a flat edge, and that both edges line up evenly with one another.

Alternatively, you can use 220-grit sandpaper instead of a flat file.
Sand or file the edges down while holding the domes on a flat surface. Work in figure-eight motions, applying even pressure the entire time, until the edges are flat and smooth.

, Return to the two flat 26-gauge (0.4 mm) discs. Use a disc cutter or jeweler's saw to cut the center out of each one, creating two bearing plate rings.Before cutting, use your divider tool to mark out a border measuring 1/8 inch (3 mm) from the edge of each disc.
Carefully cut along the marked border. The centers can be discarded, but the ring-shaped borders will become your bearing plates that hold the photograph in place.

, File down the outer and inner edges of both bearing plates. Use a large, flat file for the outer edge and an inside ring sanding cone for the inner edge.

You'll need to wrap 220-grit sandpaper around the sanding cone before using it. You can also use flat 220-grit sandpaper to file down the outer edge.
Make sure that both holes are identical, smooth, and evenly round when finished.

, Center one dome over one bearing plate and solder the pieces together with a large, soft flame. Repeat with the other dome and bearing plate.

Place the bearing plate solder-side up on a tripod soldering stand fitted with a mesh screen. Center the dome over the bearing plate solder-side (indented-side) down.
Set a handheld soldering torch to a large, soft flame. Work the flame around all sides of the metal, making sure that both the top and bottom receive even heating.
Check the solder once the metal cools. The bearing plate and dome should be thoroughly fixed together.
The two soldered pieces will form the two sides of the locket shell.

, Cut three hinge knuckles from tubing with an interior diameter of 0.04 inch (1 mm). Each knuckle should be 1/8 inch (3 mm) long.

Use a jeweler's tube cutting jig while cutting to prevent the tubing from warping. Place the tubing over the jig, then cut off 1/8 inch (3 mm) section using a jeweler's saw.
Check the edges of all three hinges before continuing. All three pieces must lie flush against one another when lined up end-to-end, or else the hinge will not work correctly.

, Tape the two halves together, then file down a flat groove for the hinge.

Use masking tape to hold the locket case pieces together, bearing plates facing inward.
Create a 5/16 to 23/64 inch (8 to 9 mm) long groove where the two cases pieces meet. Establish the groove using the edge of a square or triangular needle file.
After you create the groove, you should even it out using a 0.06 inch (1.5 mm) round needle file or diamond core drill.
Verify that the hinge groove is just barely wide enough and long enough for your three hinge knuckles, then remove the masking tape.

, Lightly coat the locket case in correction fluid, then clamp the pieces together using binding wire.

Only apply the correction fluid to areas you do not wish to solder. It will protect the silver from the flame and prevent the area beneath from melding together. Coat all sides of the locket that shouldn't be soldered, including the interior, and allow the correction fluid to dry.
Tie the binding wire around the locket shell securely to prevent the pieces from shifting around as you solder the hinge on.

, Hold the locket shell over a solid soldering pad with the hinge groove facing up. Apply flux to the entire hinge structure, then carefully position the hinge knuckles on top of the hinge groove.

You will probably need someone else's help during this step. Instruct your helper to hold the locket shell steady using soldering tongs.
Lightly apply liquid solder flux to all metal pieces, including the entire locket shell and all three hinge knuckles.
Line up the hinge knuckles along the hinge groove, keeping them straight and level.
Thread all three knuckles with a piece of iron binding wire to keep them straight. The wire will also block some of the heat, preventing the inside of the hinge from melding together during the soldering process.

, Carefully solder the top and bottom knuckles to the back locket case, then solder the middle knuckle to the front locket case.

Brush the entire assembly with a soft flame until the flux dries, creating a white crust.
Position medium solder pallions in between the locket case and knuckles. The pallions beneath the top and bottom knuckles should also touch the back case, but the pallion beneath the middle knuckle should touch the front case.
Heat the entire structure again using another large, soft flame from a soldering torch. When the flux dries to a clear state, focus the heat of the flame directly over the top and bottom knuckles from the back of the locket, holding it there until the pieces solder together.
Immediately redirect the flame to the front of the locket and the middle knuckle, holding it there until they solder together, as well.

, Submerge the locket in water and hold it there for several seconds. This should rapidly cool the metal and stop it from melding together any further.

As soon as you quench the locket, you should also remove the binding wire holding it together.

, Test the strength and alignment of your hinge knuckles to make sure that they are secure.

Pry the locket open and use your fingernail to test the hinge along each joined knuckle. If any of the knuckles are not completely and steadily soldered, you will need to try again.
After determining that the hinge is steady enough, run a wire through it to check the alignment.

, Place a 1/8 inch (3 mm) jump ring over the top center of the back shell, then solder it in place.

Separate the locket and set aside the front piece. Work only with the back piece right now.
Mark the top center and file a small groove into it.
Place the back piece flat-side down over a solid soldering pad and position the jump ring directly into the groove you just created.
Use a low flame from your soldering torch to meld the jump ring in place, then quench the locket by submerging it in water.

, Turn the back piece of the locket over to look at the inner bearing plate. Mark and drill a hole on the bearing plate directly opposite the hinge.

The hole should be in the middle of the bearing plate.
Use a hand drill to carefully make a hole with a diameter of 0.04 inch (1 mm) through the bearing plate only.

, Cut a short length of 18-gauge (1-mm) sterling silver wire and fit it into the friction-clasp hole. Solder the bottom of the wire to the back locket case.

Carefully trim the wire down to a length of 3/16 inch (5 mm) before inserting it into the hole with flatnose pliers. The bottom of the wire must touch the inside of the dome.
Keep the pin straight as you carefully solder it in place with a soft flame.
Quench the piece in water and check the strength of the join with your fingernail.

, Hold both sides of the locket together and slide a hinge pin through all three knuckles.

Choose wire made from brass, nickel, or 14k white gold. These metals are more durable than silver.
Hammer one end of the wire so that it flares out slightly, then insert the straight end into the knuckles.
The wire should fit into the knuckles snugly to keep the hinge tight and durable. If necessary, pull the wire through the knuckles using pliers.

, Cut off any excess wire and flare the straight end by gently tapping it with a cross-peen hammer.

You can use wire cutters to cut away any excess hinge pin wire.
Hold the currently flared end of the pin against a bench anvil, then carefully tape the other end to match the flare.

, Mark the point where the friction clasp pin meets on the front bearing plate, then carefully drill a hole into the bearing plate for the pin to fit into.

Close the locket and mark the point at which the friction clasp pin hits the front bearing plate.
Use a 0.04 inch (1 mm) ball bur to indent the marked point. Test the positioning by closing the locket and verifying that the pin fits into the indentation.
Carefully use a hand drill to drill a 0.035 inch (0.9 mm) hole into the front bearing plate. Only drill through the bearing plate and not through the dome.

, Trim the friction-clasp pin and file the tip so that it locks into the newly created pin hole.

Use wire cutters or a file to trim the pin as needed, the use a needle file to round off the top.
As you round the top of the pin, file a notch to one side. This notch will allow the pin to fit into the hole with a snap.

, Buff the surface of the locket using Tripoli buffing compound, then polish the surface with polishing rouge.

You can also add the bail at this point or do so later. Simply fit a 12-gauge (2.1 mm) jump ring into the bail loop.

, The locket is now ready to use. Insert any picture you'd like, hang it from a necklace chain, and wear as desired."

Due to the fact that silk stretches, you'll want to gently pull your thread taut to pre-stretch it after you snip your length free from its spool. This will prevent your necklace from stretching longer than you intend.For the purposes of providing a guided example, a 5-foot (1.524 m) length of silk thread will be used. This length is sufficient for a 16 to 20 inch (40.64 to 152.4 cm) knotted strand.
Generally, necklace lengths are broken down accordingly:12 - 13 inches (30.5 - 33 cm): collar length. This necklace will lay across the middle of the neck without much loose line.14 - 16 inches (35.6 - 38.1 cm): choker length. A classic style that encircles the neck comfortably.17 - 19 inches (43.2 - 48.3 cm): princess necklace length. One of the most common lengths, well suited for plunging necklines.26 - 36 inches (66 - 91.4 cm): opera necklace length. A lower hanging length of pearls that will hang about to your sternum.

, Silk is a resilient fiber, but over time the oil from your skin, residue from soap, and other environmental factors will cause your line to weaken. To prevent this from happening, you should coat your line with beeswax.Rub a small amount of beeswax along the entire length of silk thread, then stretch the silk thread once more after applying the beeswax.

, Fold the silk thread in half and tie a knot connecting the loose ends together. You might also use a bead clamp to fasten the ends together., Scattered pearls can be easily lost in the nooks and crannies of your home. You should count your pearls beforehand so you know the total number in case a spill happens. Then, lay a towel down where you are working so that the pearls nest in it instead of rolling away.


Beading mats and trays are specialty tools used by serious beaders, but these can also make your pearl necklace making experience more efficient.

, You'll want to use a thin wire needle, which should fit easily through your pearl holes, to string pearls one at a time onto your thread. If you have a special pearl you plan on placing centrally, or different varieties you plan on using in a pattern, remember that your pearls will be strung in reverse fashion - the first pearls on the line will be at one end of your line, and the last pearls at the other.

, You should check the width of your thread by passing the threaded wire needle through a pearl and then back again. If the needle can't pass through the hole, a smaller size thread would likely suit your situation best.


The line is generally considered to be too small if a pearl can slip over an overhand knot.

, Thread your needle through one of your clamshell tips and string it all the way to the end knot connecting the loose ends of your line. Once your knot is nestled inside the clamshell tip, add a dab of glue and close the clamshell tip to close off that end of the line., Pearls can deteriorate over time if rubbed against a hard surface, like your metal clamshell tips. By tying a knot between the clamshell tip and your pearls, you'll increase longevity., Take your threaded needle and, one by one, string your pearls on the silk line of your necklace. Knots are a good way of adding spacing to the pearls of your necklace, but these will also prevent wear and tear on your pearls from rubbing against each other. An overhand knot should do nicely for the purposes of spacing your pearls.If you decide on using knots to space your pearls, be sure your knots are tied tightly. You should be able to cinch the knot tightly against the previously strung pearl by sliding it toward the pearl with your fingernail.
For greater precision when tying the knots of your pearl necklace, you should use tweezers.

, The way a necklace drapes across your neck will be different from how it looks sitting on the table. You should verify the length of your necklace as you string by pinching the loose end with one hand to keep pearls from falling off and holding the necklace against your neck.

, You should pull your line first through the side opposite where the line will be nested in the cup of the clamshell. Then knot your line securely and tuck this knot inside the hollow part of the clamshell tip. Place a bad of jewelry glue onto the knot and close the clamshell., Take your pliers and bend your clamshell tips into an open position so you can link one tip to your claps and the other to your jump ring. Once the clasp and jump ring are in place, bend your clamshell tips closed and dab a small amount of glue where the clamshell tip end bends back in on itself to prevent it from coming loose."

Find a piece of stainless steel wire.,
Cut the wire to your desired length.,
Lay out your beads.,
Tie a knot at one end of the wire.,
Thread your needle.,
Use your needle to attach the beads to the necklace.,
Tie both ends of the necklace together.",How to Make a Necklace1," You should look for wire with 19, 21, or 49 strands of stainless steel wire that is coated with nylon. This measurement will ensure that the strands won't kink and that the necklace will be durable. This wire will be clear or light-colored, and won't show through the necklace unless that's your intention.;
, You can determine the length of your necklace by measuring your neck. If you want a choker, it should be tighter, and if you want a looser necklace, the string will be longer. You should always make the necklace a bit longer than the length of your neck.


If you're not using a clasp, you should still add 3-4 inches (7.6-10.1 cm) to the length to account for the string you'll be tying together, and if you're using a clasp, you should add an extra 4-8 inches (10.1-20.3 cm) to the length of your necklace.
If you're not using a clasp, remember that the necklace will have to slide over your head so you should account for that in your length. If you're determined to make a choker without using a clasp, then you can tie and untie the ends of the necklace every time you put the necklace on and take it off, but that can be a bit time-consuming.

, You should choose the pattern of beads you'd like to use for your necklace before you start stringing them onto the wire. If you create your pattern as you string the beads, you may find that you've changed your mind in the middle of the project. If you're using just one type of bead, then this part is easy.


If you're using a variety of beads, then you should pick an eye-catching pattern that either repeats or emphasizes the center of the necklace.
You can lay the wire horizontally below the beaded pattern to ensure that you're using the right amount of beads.
You don't have to cover all of the wire with beads -- you can leave a few inches of string on either end, or even leave half of the string un-beaded. It's up to you.

, This knot will keep the beads from falling off the necklace. If the beads have bigger holes, you can even tie the knot twice. Make sure to leave at least 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm) on the other end of the knot so you can use this length to tie the necklace together later.

, Run the wire through the eye, or the hole, in the needle. The needle will make it easier for you to attach the beads to the necklace. You can also bead the necklace without using the needle, but that will be trickier and will require more dexterity.

, Just poke the needle through the beads, one at a time, and then slide them down the necklace until they stop at the knot. Continue this until you've threaded all of the beads onto the necklace. Then remove the needle and tie another knot at the other end of the necklace. You should have tied a knot at the same distance from the other end of the necklace -- about 2-3 inches (5-7.6 cm).

, You can use a square knot, a double knot that will secure the ends of the necklace together. Now that you've made your necklace, you can put it on and start wowing your friends and start spicing up your everyday outfits.

Enjoy your new necklace.",How to Make a Necklace2," You can use old buttons that you have lying around, buy buttons from a craft store, or use a mixture of old and new buttons. Place the buttons on a smooth surface until you're happy with the color combination you've created for your button necklace.

, You should look for wire with 19, 21, or 49 strands of stainless steel wire that is coated with nylon. This measurement will ensure that the strands won't kink and that the necklace will be durable. Once you've found the right wire, just cut it to your desired length.


Remember to leave at least 4-8 inches (10.1-20.3 cm) to account for the clasp at the end.

, This will secure the end of the wire and will also secure the buttons onto the end of the necklace. When you're done stringing the beads, you can tie the other clasp to the other end of the wire.

, Choose a pattern for the buttons, whether it's alternating or just completely random. You can lay the wire horizontally below the pattern to ensure that you're using enough, but not too many, buttons.

, Once you've chosen your button pattern, just string the wire through the two holes in each button until all of them are tied to the necklace. Remember to leave enough room so that the remaining wire can be secured to the other clasp.

, This will complete your button necklace.

, Have fun wearing this funky necklace with a variety of outfits.

Clip the cord onto a clipboard.,
Start looping.,
Keep going.,
Tie the ends.",How to Make a Choker1," You should be able to find this at a craft store like Michael’s or Joann Fabric, or you could just purchase it online. It comes in a variety of colors., Cut a piece of cord about two arm-lengths long. Making this choker uses a lot of cord. If in doubt, err on the side of too much—you can always trim it later.







, Fold your length of cord in half, and secure the halfway point by clipping it onto a clipboard. You can also use a binder clip and a hardcover book if you do not have a clipboard.







, A tattoo choker is basically made up of a series of simple loops. Start with the cord on the left (we’ll call it “L”). Loop it over the cord on the right (“R”). Wrap L around R, then pull it back through the loop you made, tying L to R. Pull it up so the loop is at the top of the cords.







, Do the same thing again, this time beginning on the right, and looping R around L. Make sure you keep alternating sides as you go, or it won’t come out right. Keep going until it is long enough to fit around your neck.








, This choker will be relatively stretchy, so you can just tie it off when it is the right size for your neck, and stretch it over your head to put it on. Thread one end of the cord through the loop at the other side of the choker, and tie it securely to the other end.









Melt the knot together with a match or lighter to keep the Stretch Magic Cord from coming untied while you’re wearing the choker."

Figure out how long to cut chain or string.,
Attach a clasp to the chains.,
Add the pendant to the choker.,
See how it looks.",How to Make a Choker2," You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the chain around your neck and adding an inch. When you’ve got the right measurement, cut the chain. Then cut another chain which is longer than the first.

, Use a jump ring to link together one end of each chain and a lobster clasp. Close the jump ring with a pair of needle-nose pliers.









Jewelry-making supplies like lobster clasps and jump rings can be purchased online or from craft stores, or you can recycle them from old jewelry., Thread both chains through the loop on the pendant. If the loop is not big enough, attach a jump ring to it and thread the chains through that so the pendant can slide easily.







, Fasten the smaller of the two chains around your neck using the lobster clasp. Using a mirror, adjust the length of the second chain until it hangs the way you want it to. Cut it to that length, and attach it to the first chain with a jump ring."
"
Figure out what length you need.,
Hem the ends.,
Add a way to tie it.,
Attach a clasp.",How to Make a Choker3," You can do this either by using a measuring tape to measure the circumference of your neck and then adding an inch, or by simply wrapping the ribbon around your neck and then adding an inch. When you’ve got the right measurement, cut the ribbon.







, Fold one end of the ribbon back onto itself to create a loop about ¼ - ½ inch long. Sew it in place with thread that is a similar color to the ribbon. Do the same thing on the other side of the ribbon, making sure to fold it in the same direction as before, so that the cut ends both lay on the side of the ribbon that will not be visible when you wear it.








If you are in a hurry or don’t feel like sewing, you can always opt to simply tie the ribbon in a bow at the back of your neck. If you want to do this, you should add an extra two or three inches to the diameter of your neck, rather than just one., Cut a two or three inch length of string or embroidery floss. You may want to select one that is a similar color to the ribbon, but it will not be visible from the front, so any color will do if that’s not available. Just thread it through the loops you sewed, and tie the ends together to hold your choker in place. Trim any excess string.








, For a slightly classier look than just tying it on with a string, add a clasp and chain. These can be purchased online, or you could just recycle one from an old necklace you don’t wear anymore. The choker should already be pretty close to the right length, so a half-inch in length on either side should be fine. Jewelry chain is very fine, so you should be able to cut it with an ordinary pair of scissors. Just sew it in place by threading the needle through the links in the chain a few times."

Assemble your materials.,
Pierce a hole in the pick.,
Drill a hole in the pick.,
Insert the jump ring.,
Thread the pick onto a necklace.,
Measure your necklace material.,
Knot the ends of the necklace.,
Add closures to the ends of the necklace.",How to Make a Guitar Pick Necklace," Making your own guitar pick necklace requires only a few basic materials depending on how you want to create and customize your necklace:


Guitar pick
Work surface protectorPliers
6 mm jump ringsNecklace or necklace material (ball chain, leather cord, string, etc.)Lobster claw clasp (optional)Drill with 2mm drill bit (optional)Hand drill with 2mm drill bit (optional)Sharp pin, needle or awl (optional)Lighter (optional)Necklace closures (optional)
Wire cutters (optional);
, Lay your guitar pick on a protective surface on top of your workspace. Consider using an old phone book, or a large foam cushion.Get your lighter and sharp pin, needle, or awl. Hold the pin over the lighter flame for about 5 seconds. When the pin is hot, press and poke the pin about 2 mm from the top of the pick.In most guitar pick necklaces, the wide portion of the pick is considered the top, with the pointed tip considered as the bottom. However, you can designate the top and bottom to make you guitar pick necklace any way you want.
Keep heating the pin and pressing it onto the pick until you are able to poke all the way through the pick. The size of the hole should also be about 2 mm in size, so the jump ring can fit though.If you don’t have a lighter, you can heat the pin up with a stove flame or a candle., Place your guitar pick on your protective surface. For drilling, a thick phone book works very well as a protective surface.Position the drill vertically over the pick, and press the 2 mm drill bit straight onto the pick.Place the drill bit about 2 mm down from the top of the pick. Slowly pull the drill trigger to begin drilling through the pick. Once the drill pops through the pick, the pick will wind up the drill treads.When the guitar pick winds up the treads, reverse the direction of the drill, so you can remove the pick from the drill bit.Use your fingers to wipe off any drilled plastic residue from the pick.
If you don’t have a power drill, you can use a hand drill with a 2 mm bit to create the hole in the pick.Simply place the hand drill approximately 2 mm down from the top of the pick, and start twisting the drill with steady pressure. Once the drill is through, twist the hand drill in the opposite direction to remove the pick.If you use the hand drill, you can clean up the hole by drilling from the other side of the pick once you make that first hole., Position the opening of the jump ring to face upward. Hold one side of the jump ring opening with your thumb and pointer fingers.Use needle nose pliers to clamp onto the side of the jump ring. Twist one end of the opening of the ring away from the other end to slightly open the ring.Feed the open just ring through the hole in the pick and use your pliers to twist and pinch the two open ends back together.If you fingers aren’t strong enough to hold to jump ring steady as you bend the end of the ring with the pliers, you can use another pair of pliers to hold the ring in place as you bend it open.
Don’t pull the jump ring apart. Twist the sides of the ring to open it. Pulling the ends away from each other will weaken the jump ring., If you already have a chain or necklace material you want to put the guitar pick onto, simply thread the pendant through one side of the chain and connect the ends of the necklace.If your necklace material is a leather cord or string, simply knot the ends of the cord together, and slip the necklace over your head.However, if you don’t have a spare chain or want to make your own necklace for the pick, you can easily do so with some materials from your local craft store.

, Lay your chosen necklace material out on your work surface. Use your ruler to measure how long you want the necklace to lie around your neck. Some common necklace measurements are 20”, 18” and 16” long.Wrap the necklace material around your neck to experiment.


If you want your necklace shorter and your necklace material is metal, use wire cutters to cut through the necklace material.Otherwise, use scissors to cut through leather cord, or string material.
To avoid sharp metal edges, use a metal nail file to file down pointy edges., If your necklace is a leather or string material, you can simply knot the ends of the necklace together. Thread the pick pendant through the necklace. From here, you can make two variations of knots:



One knot: To knot your necklace with one knot, simply tie a normal over hand knot at the ends of the necklace.If your necklace is longer and cat fit over your head, tie the knot first, then put on the necklace. If you necklace is smaller, wrap the necklace around your neck and stand in a mirror so you can see yourself making the knot.

Two knots: To knot your necklace with two, adjustable knots, take each end of the necklace and make a knot around the other end of the necklace approximately 4” from each end.Pull and tighten each knot, and trim off the excess necklace material from the knot. Leave about ¼” of space on the trimmed end.This method works better with longer necklaces.
Hold and pull the two knots away from each other to tighten the necklace, and pull the knots closer together to loosen the necklace., If your necklace is a metal chain from a craft store, you need to add on your own closures. Just how you opened and added a jump ring through the guitar pick, you now have to open and add a jump ring through the small ring at the end of the metal chain.Use your pliers to open the jump ring, and slide it through the small hole. Close the jump ring by pinching the two sides of the jump ring together.


Use your pliers to open up and add another jump ring to the smaller ring on the end of your lobster claw clasp.Once the jump ring is added to the clasp, the jump ring can be added to the other of the necklace. Again, use pliers to open up and close the jump ring onto the end of the necklace.
When all the rings are closed and secure, you can attach the two end closures and your homemade guitar pick necklace is ready to wear.If your necklace is a ball-linked chain, your chain most likely came with a closure at one end of the chain. Simply slip and snap one of the balls on the end of the chain into the closure on the other end of the chain, and your necklace is ready to wear.

Save your longest necklaces for high necklines and evening wear.",How to Choose the Right Necklace Length," Before purchasing a necklace, it’s wise to first measure the circumference of your neck. This is especially true if you are considering buying a very short chain, like a collar or choker, since those styles are supposed to fit relatively tightly. Wrap a soft measuring tape around your neck, holding it close to your skin. Make a mental note of your measurement and take it into account when selecting a length.For chokers, add two inches to whatever your neck measurement is for a comfortable fit.
Adding four inches to your neck measurement will give you a good length for an average necklace, like a pendant.;
, Short chains, like collars and chokers, look most flattering on those who have long, slender necks. They look less flattering on short or wide necks.If you have a short neck, you can make your neck look longer by choosing a chain that measures between 20 and 24 inches (50 and 60 cm) in length. If your neck is an average length and width, then you can probably wear any length of necklace successfully.


For those with wide necks who are considering a choker length, you may need to go up an inch or two to ensure it fits comfortably.That means adding three to four inches to your neck measurement instead of only two.
If you have a wide neck, you can typically wear any length that you like, but consider the width of the chain. Opt for a thin chain over a thick one.

, If you have a wide or short neck, try to avoid short chains and go for something 18 inches (45 cm) or longer. This will take the emphasis off your neck area and place it more on your collarbone and bust area. You can increase this effect by adding an eye-catching pendant or charm to the chain. This will naturally draw eyes to the jewelry and away from your neck.


If you have wrinkles or feel less than comfortable with the appearance of your neck, opt for a longer chain, as well., To emphasize a long, graceful neck, go for a shorter chain that measures between 14 and 18 inches (35 and 45 cm). Collar and choker necklaces are great options because they are very short and draw the attention straight to your neck.


Choose a short chain that has eye-catching details to emphasize the area even more.

, If you’re on the short side (below 5’4” or 162 cm), go with a 16 to 20 inch (40 to 60 cm) necklace. Anything longer than that tends to overwhelm small frames. Those of average height (between 5’4” and 5’7”) can get away with wearing almost any length of necklace. Most necklace lengths flatter taller frames (5’7” or 170 cm and higher) as well, but long chains can look especially flattering since they accentuate height.While someone with a tall frame can definitely pull off a short chain, keep in mind that this style may not stand out as much as you’d like.
If you’re short, try to avoid chunky necklace designs, which can overwhelm your frame as much as a long chain length., A necklace emphasizes the area where it falls on your body. If you don’t want to draw attention to a certain area, avoid necklaces that end there. For example, if you have a small bust, long and layered chains will flatter your body type. Try something between 28 and 38 inches (71 and 96 cm) in length. Those with fuller figures may want to avoid very long chains, since they won’t hang properly. Go for a chain that is between 18 and 22 inches (45 and 55 cm) in length, as these will sit higher up on the neckline.

, The necklace length you choose can help you emphasize your best facial features. Likewise, it can also accentuate features you’d rather play down if you aren’t careful. Use your basic face shape as a guide for selecting the best necklace length for you. For example, if your face is round, avoid chokers and other short necklaces, since these will emphasize the roundness of your face.Oval shaped faces can typically wear any length.
If your face is long, a short chain (between 16 and 18 inches/40 and 45 cm) will soften and round off its appearance.
For those with heart-shaped faces, try a choker or other short necklace style. Short chains will create the appearance of fullness and balance out a narrow chin., Since shorter chains emphasize the neck area, you’ll want to choose tops that allow you to expose that area.The more bare skin that surrounds a choker, the more the necklace will stand out. To get the most flattering results, go for tops with sweetheart, scoop, v-neck, strapless, off-the-shoulder and square necklines.


Avoid wearing turtlenecks and other high necklines with chokers.
To make your choker stand out even more, coordinate the basic necklace design with the neckline of your top. For example, pair a round-shaped choker with a top that has a scoop neck.

, This length is the most common necklace length available.A necklace that is 18 inches (45 cm) long will fall at approximately the collar bone area and marry well with almost anything in your closet.You could wear it with a t-shirt or simple top just as successfully as you could with a dress or other formal attire.

, Chains that are between 20 and 24 inches (50 and 60 cm) in length are as versatile as 18 inch (45 cm) chains, since they can be easily styled with both casual and dressy clothing. However, they work particularly well with slightly more formal attire, such as clothing you would wear to the office. These chains will end somewhere between the collarbone and bust area., High necklines will balance out the length of the chain and allow you to best showcase the look of the necklace. For instance, try pairing a long necklace with an eye-catching pendant with a turtleneck. Additionally, long chains tend to create a dressier, more elegant vibe. Wear a long strand of pearls with an evening gown or cocktail dress.Extremely long necklaces that measure between 36 and 42 inches (91 and 106 cm) in length should be looped around the neck twice.

Trim excess cord.",How to Make a Hemp Necklace," Hemp typically comes in a natural tan color, but there are many other colors to choose from. Hemp twine is most often 1mm, although you can find thicker cord. When you choose your cord, make sure that is is even and smooth—unless you prefer a coarser twine.You can order hemp online or find it at an arts and crafts or hobby store.;
, This method shows how to involve beads and a pendant into your necklace. You can choose to add more beads, or you can decide to only use twine for your necklace. If you decide to only use twine, continue knotting as usual and don’t worry about stringing on the beads., Using scissors, cut one 5-yard (4.5-meter) length of hemp. Then, cut another length, twice as long as the piece of jewelry, plus a few extra inches. This necklace will be about 1.5 feet (~0.5 meter) long, so a single yard (almost a meter) would be appropriate.








If you would like a shorter or longer necklace, you can measure the twine around your neck. Add several feet to the amount that you measure to allow space for knotting., Rub your hemp thread with beeswax before starting. It helps keep the knots tight and also helps to protect the piece from getting soiled. You can usually find bars of beeswax at hobby stores., Fold these lengths in half with the shorter length on the inside and the 5-yard (4.5 meter) length on the outside. The longer 5-yard (4.5 meter) string will make up the “knotter” cords, which will be used to make the knots, while the shorter string will be the carrier cords that are used to anchor the knots. Make sure the ends of each string line up evenly.







, Tie this knot at the top of the loops. This keeps the loops from coming undone.







, Put the shorter strands on the inside. The longer strands need to be on the outside. If you cannot get the cords to line up just right, you might need to untie your knot, line up the ends again, and then retie the knot.







, Start by grabbing the cord to the far right. Draw it underneath the first two cords to the left and over the last one. Make a loop with the cord to the far right. Bring the cord underneath the first two cords to the left and over the last one.








Bring the cord on your far left over the two middle cords and through the loop.

, Keep the two center cords taut and pulled tight parallel to the surface you're working on. Pull the two outside cords up at a vertical angle as the knot runs up the center cords. Tighten the knot when it reaches the top, For a flat look to your hemp, alternate the side with which you start. For this design, continue knotting until you reach an inch (2.5 cm) in length, or about 17 knots.







, Secure the against the most recent knot. Then, tie the two outer cords in a square knot beneath the bead. You can continue knotting if you don’t want to add beads to your necklace.







, Continue knotting with half square knots as outlined above. Do this until you have knotted 6 inches (15.2 cm). You should still have plenty of hemp leftover at this point.(15.2 cm).








, Attach the pendant when you've reached about the middle of your necklace (6 or 7 more inches, or 15 or 17 cm). You can add a pendant by stringing it onto the bottom cord. Resume knotting as usual once the pendant is on.








, Continue to knot away from the pendant. When you reach a length that matches that between the first bead and the pendant, string the second bead onto the two center cords. Knot the two outside cords underneath.







, For this design, knot another inch (2.5 cm) away from the last bead. Or, finish knotting when you have reached the length that you want your necklace to be. You are almost finished with your necklace at this point.







, There are several ways you can finish your necklace. You can use clasps, or you can use the easiest method and simply tie it off. If you don’t want to use claps, tie an overhand knot just beneath the last half-square knot. You can apply glue to the knot as you tie it for additional hold.







, To use a metal clasp, you will need to finish off the ends of the necklace with metal or wire cord tips. You can simply use regular glue to secure the tips. Then, depending on the type of clasps you have, you can either bend the metal clasps over the cord. Or, you can crimp the clasp around the cord if your clasps use a coil. Finish by adding jump to the clasp., You can use any type of scissors to cut the excess hemp. Cut about 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the overhand knot so you have plenty of length to adjust and tie the necklace. If you don’t think you will need to adjust it, you can cut off 2 or 3 inches of cord.

Preserve the shells.",How to Make a Shell Necklace," You can select shells based on a variety of factors, including type, shape, size, color, or pattern. The shells and necklace style you choose are a matter of personal preference, so feel free to experiment. Before drilling holes in the shells, arrange them on a flat surface so you can see how they’ll look together as a necklace.To make a pendant necklace, choose a medium shell with an interesting shape or color. You can also decorate a pendant necklace with smaller shells, but make sure they match or complement the design, color, and shape of the centerpiece.Another option is to create a bold necklace with lots of medium-sized shells, which can either be distributed evenly around a cord or clustered together at the bottom.;
, Just because the focus of your necklace is the seashell doesn’t mean you can't embellish it with other decorations, such as beads, charms, flowers, stones, and other jewels.

Select decorations that complement the size, shape, and color of your shells. Make sure to match the embellishments with the type of cord you use as well.

, There are many types of cords you can use when making a necklace, and the style you choose will depend on the look you're going for.

To create a piece of fine art, choose a metal chain in gold or silver.
For a more rustic piece of jewelry, try twine or linen cord.
For a durable and versatile necklace, try jewelry wire or nylon line.

, To make your necklace, you will need a drill with a one-sixteenth-inch (1.6 mm) drill bit, jewelry findings, and needle nosed pliers.In case you don’t have a drill, you can use a nail or screw and a hammer to make holes.
Jewelry findings that you may need include jump rings to attach the shells to the cord, and a clasp mechanism to close the necklace. Findings are optional if you're using string or cord, as you can choose to wrap the cord and tie the necklace instead.
With metal necklace chains, you likely won’t have to worry about a clasp, as this will already be attached.

, In order to string your shells onto a cord, you will need to create a hole in each shell. Use a marker or pencil to mark the spot on each shell where you want it to attach to the cord.


Hold the shell against a flat surface and use light pressure to drill a small hole in the shell. Start drilling on the inside and work your way out.If you don’t have a drill, make an initial hole by using a hammer to gently tap the head of a screw or nail through the shell. Once you have a small hole, turn the head of the nail or screw back and forth inside the hole until it’s large enough to accommodate the jump ring or your twine., Using jump rings is optional, but it will help your shells hang properly on the cord. Grab the pliers and a jump ring, and use the pliers to stretch the jump ring open. Loop the ring through the hole in a shell, then close the ring with the pliers.Repeat this step for every shell you'll be stringing on your necklace. For added interest, you can hang more than one shell, charm, or bead on each jump ring.

, To make a pendant necklace or a necklace with a special accent piece at the center, string this shell first. Then decorate the remaining cord any way you like, using other shells, charms, beads, and jewels. Or if you prefer, you can also leave the remaining cord empty, which will bring more focus to the accent piece.

While your necklace doesn’t have to be symmetrical, it should be balanced. For instance, instead of matching a large shell on one side with a large shell on the other, consider balancing the large shell with two or three small shells.

, For necklaces made with twine, cord, or nylon line, you can just tie the ends of the necklace together if you wish. Otherwise, you can finish the necklace by adding a clasp:On each end of the necklace, attach a crimp, followed by the clasp end.
Loop the excess cord or wire back through the crimp. Pull it tightly so the clasp and crimp are touching, and are butted up firmly against the final bead or shell. Continue holding the excess cord firmly as you use the pliers to crimp the metal crimp in place.
Use scissors or wire cutters to cut the excess cord.

, For this project, look for a double necklace (one that has two rows of chains attached near the clasp). Make sure there's at least one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between the upper and lower chain.

The type of metal, such as silver or gold, is a matter of preference. Choose something that will complement your shell selection.

, For this project, you will need 10 small shells of roughly the same shape, three medium shells of your choosing, and one medium conical shell. The color choices and shell styles are a matter of personal taste.

This necklace will have two focal points: a cluster of three medium shells in the center of the upper chain, and the conical shell at the center of the lower chain.
The 10 smaller shells will be distributed evenly around the focal point shells.

, Along with the chain and the shells, you'll also need 24-gauge jewelry wire (in a color of your choice), pliers, wire cutters, a drill, and 12 jump rings., Set aside your conical shell. For the other 13 shells, drill holes in them in the location where you want them to attach to the necklace. Use a marker or pencil to mark the spot on each shell where you want it to attach to the cord, then hold the shell against a flat surface and use light pressure to drill a small hole in the shell. Finish preparing the shells by doing the following:

Use the pliers to attach a jump ring to each of the 10 smaller shells. Do not close the jump rings yet.
With the three medium shells, arrange them all on a single jump ring, but don’t close the ring.

, To create an added point of interest, wire-wrap the conical shell and attach it to the necklace with wire, rather than a jump ring. To start, cut a piece of 24-gauge wire six times the length of the conical shell.Hold the wire in the center by pinching it with your index finger and thumb. Wrap the wire around the tip of your index finger and twist the two pieces together three times to form a small loop at the center of the wire.
Spread the two wire ends out and position the middle of the fat top (not the pointed end) of the conical shell where the twist is.
Begin wrapping the two wires around the shell at an angle, forming stripes like on a candy cane. When you’ve wrapped the entire shell right down to the tip, twist the wires around each other three times to secure them in place.
Separate the remaining wire ends. With the pliers, grab the tip of one wire and fold it back on itself. Then grab the folded end and roll it back on itself again. Continue doing this until you reach the twist and there's no more wire to roll. The excess wire should look like a spiral. Repeat with the other wire end.

, Start with the conical shell. Attach a jump ring to the wire loop you created, and attach this to a single link at the center of the necklace’s lower chain. Close the jump ring with pliers. Then take the three medium shells and position them in the center of the necklace’s upper chain. Insert the jump ring into a single link and close it.

Repeat with the 10 small shells. On the lower chain, attach three small shells to the chain on either side of the conical shell. On both sides, place the first shell two inches from the center, then the next shell another two inches from that shell, and the third shell another two inches away. Repeat with the upper chain, using only two shells on either side of the center shells.

, Seashells can either be gathered from the beach or purchased at a craft store, or you can buy synthetic or artificial shells. While artificial shells may not have the same natural appeal, they are better for the environment.


Seashells play an important role in coastal ecosystems, and provide homes to algae, birds, and hermit crabs. Removing shells from the beach can have a detrimental impact on the creatures that rely on them.If you really want to collect your own shells, only take a couple from each beach, and never take shells from highly visited beaches where others are often collecting shells. Always inspect each shell to ensure a hermit crab hasn’t claimed it for a home.Shells are also a byproduct of the fishing industry, and there are some shell suppliers that only obtain shells from these producers. Buying shells from these producers could have less of an impact than purchasing ones collected from beaches.

, Natural shells that are collected from the beach need to be cleaned to remove dirt, particles, odors, and bacteria. The most common way to clean shells is to soak them in a bleach and water solution:

Fill a bowl with one part bleach and three parts water.Soak the shells for anywhere from 30 minutes to 24 hours, until the leathery covering—called the periostracum—comes off.When the shells are clean, use a soft cloth or soft-bristled toothbrush to give them a gentle scrub, then rinse them well with clean water.
Allow the shells to dry.

, You don’t actually have to do anything to preserve the shells, but if you want to enhance and protect their shine and luster, you can polish them with mineral oil.Use a lint-free cloth to rub a small amount of mineral oil over each shell, and gently polish the inside and outside.

Since you'll be using the shells for jewelry, another option is to protect them with a thin coat of satin-finish polyurethane varnish. Apply a light layer of varnish to the inside and outside of the shells using a clean paintbrush. Allow the varnish to dry completely."

Make sure that the width and height of all 18 pieces of wood are exactly the same.
Try to purchase wood sticks that are already pre-cut to be 1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high. That way you'll only need to worry about cutting the length.;
, You'll need to cut 12 pieces at 50 mm each, with the same other dimensions as the other pieces (1 inch wide and 1/4 inch high).

, In order to removed the jagged edges left from cutting the wood, you'll need to lightly sand the edges with some sandpaper.

, To achieve the beautiful two-tone look, you'll need to stain half of the pieces of wood (of all sizes). So, separate each size of the wood pieces into two sections and apply wood stain to one group.


Choose any wood stain color you like, as long as it contrasts with the existing wood color. Apply the stain generously and wipe off the excess with a paper towel or rag. You need to cover the surface area of both sides and the ends, but don't worry about getting all of the 1/4 inch side because these sides will be glued together.
Let the stain dry completely (at least 4 hours) until you move on to the next step.

, Take the six pieces of wood that were cut to 248 mm and line them up. Each side of the jewelry box will be made out of three of the six pieces.


Use wood glue to glue the pieces together lengthwise into two three-piece sections, making sure you alternate between the stained and unstained pieces to achieve the two-tone look.
Wipe off any excess glue that leaks up between the cracks.
Make sure the ends are lined up perfectly and then let the glue dry. You can clamp the pieces into place for a more secure, tight seal if you would like.
To avoid gluing the wood to whatever surface you're working on, it might be helpful to lay down a piece of clear Saran wrap to work on.

, Alternating between stained and unstained pieces, line up six of the 240 mm pieces of wood on the Saran wrap to make the base. Glue the pieces together, but instead of lining up the ends, alternate them by 1/4 inch (so that the end pieces will fit inside the gaps).

, Line up the short end pieces that you cut (the 50 mm pieces), alternating stained and unstained pieces, on each end of the base. Each end will be six pieces long.


Because of how you off-set the edges of the base, one piece will sit on the table and be flush with the base, while the next piece will sit on top of the base, and so on.

, Glue the sides of the jewelry box to the frame that you've made (out of the base and the ends). Let the frame dry fully before you move on.


You can use some pieces of wood cut to fit the inside of the box to help the frame maintain its shape while it's drying.

, Apply a small coat of Vaseline to the off-set end pieces (the 50 mm pieces) to keep the lid from sticking to the frame with the excess glue when you glue it together.

, Glue the remaining six 240 mm pieces of wood to each other in place on top of the frame. As before, make sure to alternate between stained and unstained pieces. The pieces will fit into the existing slots made by the alternating off-set end pieces.


Once all pieces are in place, you will have a perfect rectangular box.

, To help the jewelry box dry in the right shape, clamp the box on two sides with two hand clamps. Once the glue is dry, your jewelry box is finished.

Cut the pages.,
Shake all the excess paper out.,
Glue the pages together.,
Decorate the outside.",How to Make a Jewelry Box2," The only requirement is that it be a hardcover book; you can use any kind you want, even old textbooks that you no longer need!


The length of the book is also up to you, but remember that the shorter the book (page-wise), the smaller your jewelry box will be.

, Open the book and, on the first page, draw a rectangle using your ruler. Your lines should be one inch from the edge all the way around.

, Use an X-Acto knife to cut along the lines of the rectangle you just drew. It may be helpful to use cut along the line of your ruler to keep your cuts as straight as possible.


Cut all the way around and discard the page rectangles from the center. Do this as many times as necessary.
Remember, the thicker your book is, the more cuts you'll need to make as the X-Acto knife will only go through a handful of pages at a time.
As you cut, it may be helpful to use a binder clip to hold the pages together that you have already cut. This will keep the pages you are done with out of your way as you continue cutting.

, As you cut, little slivers of paper will get lodged in the pages. Hold the book upside down by both covers and shake out any loose pieces.

, Use Mod Podge (crafting adhesive/sealant) to glue all of the pages. First, dip a paint brush in the Mod Podge and paint in between several pages to make them stick together. Then, paint the outside of all of the pages as well as the edges of the pages that are exposed inside the rectangle that you cut. You should glue the pages to the bottom cover, but leave the top cover of the book unglued.


Alternatively, you can use watered-down regular glue (Elmers, etc.) instead of the Mod Podge.
It should take the adhesive approximately ten minutes to fully dry.
Once the book is completely dry, the front cover of the book should lift up to reveal the cut-out rectangle pages where you can store your jewelry.

, If you want to, you can decorate the outside of the book to make it more attractive. You can glue on rhinestones or fabric designs (flowers, etc.) to suit your taste.

To do this, measure 4 cm on one end of the foam board (and make a mark at this point) and do the same on the other. Draw a line connecting the two marks. Then, repeat this step for the other three sides of the foam board.

, The intersections of the lines that you drew in the previous step will make square shapes in all four corners of the foam board square. Cut out the squares in each corner using an X-Acto knife.

, On the line that you drew to make the smaller square in the center of the foam board, use an X-Acto knife to make shallow cuts along the lines. You will make four shallow cut lines in the foam board.


Be careful not to cut all the way through the board.

, Fold each side of the foam board along the lines of the shallow cuts. This will make a cube shape (excluding the top section of the ""cube"").


Use masking tape to secure the sides of the cube together so that the foam board holds its shape.

, For this step, you'll need a piece of fabric (any design that you choose) that measures 24 cm by 24 cm. Lay the fabric down (pattern down) and put the cube that you've made on top of it.


You should place the cube so that the points of the fabric line up with the flat sides of the cube.
Use fabric glue to adhere the fabric to the cube. You'll put the glue on the triangle of the fabric and pull it over the edge of the jewelry box cube. Do this for all four sides.

, Take a piece of cardstock and cut out a 10 cm by 10 cm square.


Use fabric glue to adhere it to the bottom of the jewelry box.
You can choose whatever color of cardstock you like. But remember that it will be the visible bottom of the jewelry box, so make sure it is a color/design that you are comfortable with showing.

, Cut out a piece of foam board in a square that measures 11 cm by 11 cm. Glue an identical piece of foam (that also measures 11 cm by 11 cm) to the foam board.


Take a piece of fabric that measures 15 cm by 15 cm and attach it to the top that you've made just as you attached the fabric to the cube, by pulling the triangle of the fabric down over the square of the foam board. Line the points of the triangle up with the flat sides of the foam board and glue it to the foam board.
Again, you can choose any design of fabric that you want. Just make sure that it either matches or complements the pattern you used for the jewelry box base.

, Cut a piece of matching fabric that measures 4 cm by 10 cm. Glue the piece of fabric longways to the base, only gluing the bottom half of it on the base. Then glue the top half of the fabric strip to the top.

, You can leave the jewelry box as is, or add some decorative ribbon around the outside to add an extra design element.

, Make sure you don't cut too close, and that you don't cut too far. Missing the edge by too far can alter the measurements, and could affect your project. If you mess up, remember: there's another three cereal box sides.

, Simply use a permanent marker to trace the outline on the fabric of your choice. Then cut the outline out. Keep the fabric nearby, because you'll need it again soon.

, Fold each square so it sticks up, and fold the side with two squares up twice. The second square will be the top of the square.

, Make sure you don't tape the top down, and that you put the tape on the inside, not the outside. The box shouldn't come apart now.

, Before it dries, press on the fabric you cut out. It should fit evenly, if you traced correctly. It is best to take this one square at a time. Give it about fifteen minutes to dry and cool off.

, They don't need to be large, but they should be made at an angle. You can cut it with a special incision maker, or with the edge of your scissors. Make sure it's a clean cut.

, The chain should be wedged in the two incisions. The top of the jewelry should be on the top of the foam, and the bottom should be hanging down the side.

, Make sure the jewelry is on the top of the foam, and is visible when lifting the top. You're done!

Ideally, you want them to be dry and easily accessible. Dead branches and twigs are easier to work with because they are more flexible. Choose a strong thick piece to use as the trunk of the jewelry tree and a thicker log for your base.Choose your twigs and branches that have character. It’s okay if there are slight imperfections because you can shape your trunk and branches later.

, Use a miter saw or handsaw to cut a 1.5 inch disk from your log. The disk will support your trunk and act as base for stability as you place your jewelry., Use a handsaw or limb pruner to cut your trunk to your desired height. You want a trunk that’s about 22 inches tall for a thick base. Cut off any unsightly imperfections and trim down any extra branches on your trunk., Using a drill bit that is the same diameter as your trunk, drill a hole about ⅔ of the way into the disk. Use a spade bit to drill a hole about the same width of the branch that you are using as the trunk of your jewelry tree.The spade bit should have slightly poked through the bottom of the base but make sure that the rest of the bit does not.
Test that the trunk fits fare enough into the base that it is stable. Continue drilling carefully if it still needs more room.

, Insert the trunk into the base disk and turn it upside down. You should see the hole in which the tip of your spade bit came through. Use a small drill bit, slightly smaller than 2 inches, to drill a hole through the bottom of the disk and into the bottom of the trunk, about ½ - ¾ inches.Make sure to keep the trunk inserted in the base until you are finished drilling.

, Turn your bamboo bowl upside down and drill through the center with the same drill bit you used to drill the hole in your trunk, slightly smaller than two inches. Create a countersink hole large enough for the head of the screw by using a slightly larger drill bit to drill into the bowl but not deep enough that you drill through it.Use tape to mark off how deep you want to drill your countersink hole.

, Use a dollop of Gorilla glue to glue the trunk branch into the disk base. Only use enough glue to fit neatly into the large hole of the disk base. Allow the glue to sit for an hour and harden., Once the branch has been securely glued into the base disk, turn it over and place some Gorilla Glue at the center and around the edges of the base disk and set it at the bottom of the bamboo bowl., Insert your two inch wood screw at the bottom of the bowl and thread it through the disk base and the trunk branch using hole that you drilled earlier.

Choose branches that are sturdy and that have character.Match drill bits with the width of the new branches and drill holes into the trunk. Drop a bit of Gorilla Glue into the holes and add your branches.You may also attach your new branches using twine for are more artful look. Cut a long piece of twine and secure your new branches onto the trunk. Wrap each branch tightly but make sure to switch directions to secure the branches. Tie a knot at the end of the twine and Gorilla glue the end of the twine neatly., Keep the branches in place with other loose branches or scraps as the glue dries. Make sure to check on your grafted branches as the glue dries so that they don’t shift or fall., Clean off any bits of dirt or debris once the glue has dried.

If you do not have these tools, you may also simply print out your design on paper., Clean your metal with a rag and solvent to remove any grease or debris. Whether using stencil decal vinyl or paper, place your design on your 16 gauge metal. Use a soapstone pencil or a sharpie marker to trace your design onto the metal., Use a plasma cutter and keep the tip around ⅛ of an inch from the metal. Be careful to create a nice clean and smooth cut. Make sure the work area is well lit and well ventilated. Wear the proper safety gear including goggles, gloves, and protective eye gear.If you are using a normal 110v outlet, you may use a Hobart 250ci Plasma Cutter.

, Slag will be produced on the bottom and top of the metal when using the plasma cutter. Use your angle grinder to remove any slag. Clamp down your tree and use a 60 to 80 grit flap disc to clean the edges.Use the 80 grit flap disc to create the illusion of bark by grinding the surface of the tree. Remove blotches of film from the metal with the grinder for a bark like look.

When the season or line is no longer fashionable, the sample books are often donated.;
, Each strip needs to be at least 10cm/4 inches in length and 2.5cm/1 inch in width. For the best design, use a different fabric for each strip but coordinated. For example, keep flowers with flowers, stripes with stripes, etc.

, Gather it by sewing through the middle several times and knotting off tightly. Repeat for each of the other strips. They will look like little bows.

, To do this, align the middle pieces in a clock formation, fanning around. Then sew all of the center pieces together.


Use a strong needle that is suited for upholstery fabrics and a thimble or thumb protector to give you the necessary oomph to push the needle through.
Sew slowly, as this can be hard going.
For certainty of hold, do at least six stitches, up to ten at most.

You may also want to get a paper cutter designed for buttons, since this can make the process much faster. places that sell button presses often sell the cutters as well. Make sure to buy a cutter which is for the same size as your button machine.

, You will need button casing in the correct size for your machine. Make sure you have the metal or plastic disk, the matching back pin, and the mylar plastic front.

, Print the images on regular printer paper. Make sure they are the right size for your buttons. Cut them as evenly and cleanly as you can.

, The rounded top should be facing up and the disk should be placed in the side which swings and stops on the right (theoretically, the left hole).

, The image should be face up and aligned how you wish it to appear (assuming the holders are in the horizontal position). Cover the image with the clear plastic.

, The pin back goes in the other holder. The pin side should be facing down and the coil should be pointing to the right (and aligned horizontally).

, You will need this excess material to wrap around the back of your pin.

, The cardboard will make the base for your pin. The colored paper will make the back. The colored paper can be solid-colored, or it can have an interesting pattern.

, Turn the image over so that the back is facing you. Spread a thin layer of glue onto it. You can use a glue stick or school glue. If you are using school glue, you might want to apply it with a paintbrush.

, Try to center the cardboard as much as possible. You should have a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) border all around the cardboard.

, Start with the corners first. Once you have them glued down, fold all four side over onto the back of the cardboard. This will give you some nice, folded seams.

Define your purpose for making badges.,
Decide on the size of badge you want to create.,
Look for a user-friendly design.,
Look for durable construction.,
Look at the equipment the company offers with the badge making machine.,
Look at the instructional support the manufacturer provides in making buttons and badges.,
Look at your budget.",How to Buy a Badge Making Machine," If you want to produce badges to identify the wearers, such as employees of a small company or attendees at an event, you probably want a badge making machine that produces rectangular badges. If you are making badges that will be worn day in and day out, you'll want to be able to laminate them. If you want to display logos or clever sayings, you probably want a badge making machine geared to producing round buttons.


Some badge making machines are capable of creating magnets as well as badges or buttons. Other badge making machines are capable of working with thicker photo-quality paper as well as regular bond paper.;
, Many badge making machines are designed to create a single size of badge, with common sizes ranging from 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) to 3 1/2 inches (8.75 centimeters). These machines come with a punch cutter to punch out paper in the size of badge the machine makes. Some badge making machines can handle multiple badges sizes; these usually come with an adjustable rotary paper cutter. (Rotary cutters may require more maintenance than punch cutters.)


If you plan to make more than 1 size of badge, you may want to buy 2 badge making machines, each geared to a different size, instead of 1. That way, you can switch between sizes without having to take time to change out dyes for one badge size with another.
Some manufacturers use their own proprietary badge and button sizes different from those considered ""industry standard."" If you plan to buy more than 1 badge making machine, choose machines that are compatible with each other.

, If you plan to make a lot of badges, you want a badge making machine designed to let you make a number of badges at a sitting without tipping over or wearing you out. Look for a compact badge making machine with a wide base that puts its handle in easy reach and doesn't wobble or tip when you pull the handle down. You may also want a lightweight, portable badge making machine if you don't have a permanent place set up to make badges or want to make badges on site for an event.

, If you plan to make a lot of badges, you don't want the machine to break in the middle of producing them. Look for all-metal construction in the badge making machine and support components.


Going hand-in-hand with the unit's construction is the warranty the manufacturer gives it. A multiple-year or even lifetime warranty shows the manufacturer's confidence in its materials and workmanship.

, In addition to dyes and paper cutters, your badge making machine should come with a reasonable amount of button and badge parts. Software and clip art to make your own designs may be included with your badge making machine, or may be available separately.

, Some badge making machines are designed to make the button and badge making process as simple as possible. Even so, the manufacturer should provide the means to instruct you in how to use your machine and suggest projects to use it for. This can take the form of an instructional CD or DVD, streaming videos, an online user forum or a Web site or blog on which users can share their ideas and experiences with one another.

, Although overall quality of equipment, materials and support should be the most important factors when buying a badge making machine, you may not be able to afford a top-of-the-line package. If you're on a limited budget, your best approach is to rank all the machines in terms of quality and buy as far up the line as you can afford.


Be sure to factor in costs for additional badge and button blanks if you plan to start a button-making business or just simply plan to make a lot of badges. A good initial bargain on the machine itself may not be such a bargain if you have to spend more on button blanks and other materials than if you'd gone with a different company that charged more for the machine but less for supporting materials.

Open 1 small safety pin and attach beads across the length.,
Open the large safety pin.",How to Make a Brooch2," The large one will be the base of your brooch and attach all the smaller pins.

, The size or shape of the bead doesn't matter, so long as it isn't so small that it won't go on the pin or so large that it keeps the pin from closing.


Pinch the end of the safety pin with jewelry pliers; this ensures the pin won't accidentally open and spill the beads.
Repeat adding beads and pinching for the remaining small safety pins.

, String all small safety pins with beads along the length of the large safety pin. You now have a dangly brooch that can adorn any outfit.

, You'll do this at the end of the rickrack, too, when you're finished making the flower.

, They should fold together like an accordion, your needle going in and out of each lower point of the material.


When you're finished with that, fold the end of the rickrack as you did in the beginning.

, This seals up the bunch of fabric. Pull it taut; you should be left with what looks like a circle.

, Hold the raw edges of the rickrack out of the way while you do this. Stitch across and around the flower to snug up the center, working on the backside of your brooch.


This will help keep the center together and, overall, make the brooch feel firmer and sturdier.

, Sew it into the center of your rickrack flower. Tie off the thread on the back of the brooch and cut.

, This will be the base of your brooch. Add a pin back to that circle of felt.


Place the pin near the top of the circle. Sewing it in the middle will cause the brooch to sag when wearing it.

, Conceal any frayed or unsightly edges under this felt circle as your sew.

Machine-baste 1 yard (0.9 m) of lace trim.,
Gently pull the unknotted end of the thread while pushing the trim.,
Coil along the sewn edge.,
Cut a 1 1/2"" (3.75 cm) circle from the felt.",How to Make a Brooch4," Do this 1/4"" (.6 cm) from its unfinished edge. Knot the lace at one end.

, Do this a few inches at a time, in the opposite direction, until the trim bunches at the knotted end. This gives your lace a petal-like consistency.

, Brush on craft glue periodically to secure, until entire trim resembles a carnation. Tie the thread end and trim the excess.

, Using a hot-glue gun, affix the felt to the back of your coil of lace. Then glue a pin to the felt.


The lace is light enough that you should be able to glue to pin to the center. If you think the pin may fall under its own weight, glue the pin to the top of the felt circle.

Find something small, light, and with a flat back.,
Wipe the back of the object with rubbing alcohol.,
Find a flat backed safety pin that is a little bit narrower than your item.,
Draw a line of glue along the back of the pin.,
Press the back of the safety pin into the glue.,
Let the glue set before you use it.",How to Make a Pin2," The item should be no larger than your thumb. Flat items are best, but you can use a slightly-raised item, such as a button or cabochon. Here are some items that make great pins:


Cabochons
Decorative buttons (such as coat buttons)
Embroidered patches
Metal bottle caps
Wooden shapes

, Soak a cotton ball or tissue with rubbing alcohol and run it across the back of the item. This will get rid of any oils or dirt that might prevent the glue from sticking properly.

, When you place the safety pin behind your found object, you should not see it sticking out.

, You can use hot glue, but super glue or epoxy glue will work even better.

, Flip the object over, so that the back is facing you. Quickly press the safety pin onto the back. Try to align it horizontally, and make it as centered as possible.

, If you are using hot glue, this will only take a few minutes. If you are using super glue or epoxy glue, this may take several hours.

Find a small, easily-traceable image that you like.,
Consider sanding the shrink film if you plan on painting it.,
Place the shrink film on top of the image, and trace it using a permanent marker.,
Color your design.,
Go over the outlines with a permanent marker.,
Cut the shapes out.,
Bake the shapes on a parchment-lined baking sheet according to the instructions on the package.,
Take the pieces out of the oven, and let them cool.,
Seal the colored designs.,
Glue a flat backed safety pin onto the back of the shape.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Pin3," Aim for something that is about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). Remember, the image will shrink down to ½ to 2/3 of its original size by the time you are done.You can use any sort of image you like, but simple, outlines (like those from a coloring book) might be easier to work with.


If the image is on your computer, you will need to print it out onto regular printer paper.
You can resize the image using an image editing program or a photocopier.

, Use a fine grit sandpaper, and lightly buff the surface of the shrink film. This will help the paint stick better. It is not necessary for colored pencils or markers.

, Try to go over the lines as smoothly as you can. If the shrink plastic moves around too much, you can tape it down to the table.


If you can't find shrink film, you can use any type of number 6 plastic. It is usually found on take-out containers. Look for the recycling symbol on the container. There should be a number inside of it. If it is a 6, you can use it.

, Try to stick within the lines as much as possible. If you go over the lines, don't worry; you will be re-outlining the piece again. If you are using acrylic paints, be sure to thin them down first using a little bit of water. This will give you a smoother finish. It will also prevent the paint from clumping up after you back it., If you colored your design using markers or paint, wait for everything to dry first, or it will smear.

, You can use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to do this. Make sure that you cut right along the outline; try not to leave any white edges.

, If your package does not have any instructions, bake the shapes at 350°F (176.6°C) in a pre-heated oven until the pieces lay flat. This can take anywhere between 5 minutes and 35 minutes.Don't worry if the pieces start to warp and curl while baking. They will eventually flatten back out.
If you are using number 6 plastic, bake the pieces at 350°F (176.6°C) for about 3½ minutes., If you want, you can bend them while they are still warm to give then an interesting shape.

, You can use a spray-on or brush-on sealer. You can even paint on a few layers of a decoupage glue. Apply 3 to 4 layers; let each layer dry before you add the next one. This will give your pin a nice finish. It will also seal your art work and keep it from chipping., Draw a line of hot glue across the back of the safety pin. Quickly flip the shape over, and press the safety pin onto the back. Try to center it as much as possible.

Gather your supplies.,
Cut out a mockingjay image.,
Cut a cardstock circle for the outer pin frame.,
Glue your image to the cardstock.,
Add glitter to your pin.,
Attach your safety pin.,
Prevent flaking.Over the course of your wearing, glitter can become knocked loose and make a mess.",How to Make a Mockingjay Pin1," The base of your mockingjay pin will be cardstock cut out in the image of the mockingjay. Cardstock that is thin and rigid will help your pin appear the most authentic. Other materials you'll need to transform your cardstock pin include:


Compass/drinking glass
Glue (1)
Glitter (gold and silver)
Hairspray
Paint brush (1)
Safety pin (1)
Scissors
Scotch tape (1)
Stiff cardstock (1)
Tracing paper (unlined preferred);
, You should trace your image onto your thin, unlined tracing paper by laying your paper atop the mockingjay design on the cover the The Hunger Games. Then use a pencil to copy the image. Once your image is complete, you should cut it free.

, The classic mockingjay pin is represented by a bird carrying an arrow suspended in the center of a circle. To make this outer circle, you should trace a glass that is about three inches across at the base along its bottom, or use a protractor to make a similar circle.Cut the resulting circle free from your cardstock. Then, remove the inside of the circle so that only an outer ring remains.
Your outer ring can be as thin or thick as you desire, but the novels represent the outer ring as being relatively thin.
Don't cut your outer ring so thin that it is too flimsy; this will make your pin look less sturdy.

, Using a thin layer of glue, attach the edges of your mockingjay image onto your cardstock circle. Be careful not to use too much glue, as this can create an uneven or bumpy appearance in your image. Using a paint brush can help you apply a thin, even coat of glue.


You should wait until the glue is fully dry to guarantee a good seal between your image and cardstock.

, This will give it a metallic appearance, just like the real thing! After the glue has finished drying, determine which colors you want to use to give your pin some flair. You may want to use gold glitter on the outer circle and silver for the mockingjay body, mix the silver and gold together, or maybe pure gold is more your style. In any case, you should:


Place a spare sheet of paper beneath your pin to catch any stray glitter.
Paint a thin layer of glue onto the surface you will be applying your glitter.
Sprinkle your glitter onto the glue you have painted onto your pin., The easiest way to do this is to flip your pin to the back and tape a safety pin in place with scotch tape.For sturdier designs, you may want to consider using hot glue to attach your safety pin to the back of your design.

, To keep this from happening, you can lightly spray hair spray onto the glitter. Check the label of your hair spray before you use it, as scented hairspray might not be ideal for your purposes.

Layer black duct tape over the wax paper.,
Cut free excess paper and tape.,
Layer gold duct tape onto the reverse side of your circle.,
Trace the inside of your mockingjay pin image.,
Create the mockingjay bird image with the negative space.,
Create an arrow.,
Attach a safety pin to the back of your pin.",How to Make a Mockingjay Pin2," Though you can make this pin with normal duct tape, you may find that using metallic silver and gold duct tape gives a more realistic effect appearance. For this project, you will also need:


Duct tape (black and gold)
Eye pin (two inch)
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Permanent marker
Safety pin
Scissors
Seed beads
Wax paper, Cut a square of your wax paper so that it is big enough to overlap the image of the mockingjay you will be tracing.Lay your square of wax paper atop the image and then:


Use your permanent marker to outline the perimeter of your mockingjay pin image onto the wax paper.

, Take a strip of your black duct tape and cover your circle with it so the black tape completely covers one side, extending a little beyond the edges of the circle you have drawn on all sides. You should still be able to see the outer line you have traced on the un-taped, reverse side of your wax paper., The circle you have drawn will form the outer boundary of your pin, so you will need to cut it free from extra tape and paper before moving on. Use the lines on your wax paper to guide your cutting until you have a black circle. When you have completed cutting, remove the wax paper from the tape.


You may want to leave at the end of the outside of your circle. This can make it easier to remove the wax paper from the black duct tape.If you leave a tab, be sure to cut it after you pull the wax paper free so that you end up with a regular circle.

, To ensure that all gray areas on the sticky, reverse side of your circle are covered, you may want to extend your gold tape beyond the edges of the circle.Then you can cut any excess gold tape free by following the outer edge of your black circle and using it as a guide.

, You will be using the negative space (the space not filled with color) of your image to bring out the image of the mockingjay on your gold background. To do this, you'll need to:


Copy your mockingjay pin image, including the bird inside the outer circle, onto the wax paper.
Use a second piece of wax paper to draw the empty (negative) space between the outer circle and inner bird of the image.
Plan to leave tabs on your negative space cutouts to make removing the wax paper easier (optional).
Cut the negative space free, dividing it into four sections: top, wing, left, and right. These sections, when arranged together, should form the outline of a bird.
Layer black tape atop the negative space wax paper cutouts.
Remove any excess tape with your scissors.

, One section at a time, pull the black tape free from the negative space wax paper cutout and adhere it to the gold taped side of your circle. Arrange the black tape so it resembles the image of the pin, so that:


The black tape represents the empty spaces of the pin.
The gold background forms the outer circle of the pin and central image of a bird., The mockingjay pin that Katniss wears holds an arrow in its talons, so yours should as well. Take your eye pin and thread black seed beads onto it until there is only a little metal remaining at the pointed end of the pin. Then you can:


Sandwich each end of your eye pin with one square of gold tape apiece.
Trim the back in the shape of a V, with the top of the V pointing backwards.
Trim the front in an arrowhead shape, with the front of the arrowhead pointing frontwards.
Use a dab of hot glue to attach your arrow to the front of your mockingjay pin., Your mockingjay pin is now nearing completion. You only need to use a thick piece of duct tape to adhere your safety pin to the black back of your design and you should be finished.You might also consider using additional metallic tape along the wings, tail, and head to accent your mockingjay pin.

The fabric is usually a cotton polyester blend and can be found either prepackaged or on the bar at your local arts and crafts store. You can buy material that serves as both the front and back of the bean bag, or purchase different fabrics for the front and back. You will also need:


Sewing machine
Sewing thread which matches your design
Ruler
Pencil
Scissors and/or rotary blade
Dried beans, corn, or peas found in bags at your local grocery store;
, For each bean bag you will need two pieces of fabric, each 5 X 5 inches. It is best to measure the distance with a ruler, making marks with your pencil. Then cut both squares out with a pair of scissors or a rotary blade.








If you use a rotary blade, make sure you are cutting on a safe surface like a cutting board.

, If you wish to iron the fabric so that it is not wrinkled, place a tea towel overtop each piece of fabric. Plug in your iron, wait for it to heat up, and press gently against the tea towel. Do not let the iron sit on the towel too long. Keep it moving.









Make sure you are ironing on a safe surface such as an ironing board. Keep the iron away from children.

, Take one of your pieces of fabric and lay it face up (design up). Then take your other piece of fabric and lay it face down, overtop of the other piece. Make sure the edges are flush with one another. You should not be able to see any of the front design of your fabric.







, First, take a few sewing pins and stick them through the two pieces of fabric. This will hold them together as you are sewing them. Next, place one of the edges underneath the sewing needle of your sewing machine. You will want to sew a 1








As you are sewing around the edge, hold the pieces of fabric tightly together with your hands. However, make sure to keep your fingers away from the needle.
When you get to the corners you can either reposition your fabric 90 degrees and begin stitching again, or make a diagonal stitch before you begin stitching the next side.
Stitch all the way around until you are about 3 inches away from where you started. Stop there, as you will use this ""pocket"" in later steps.

, Take your thumb and pointer finger and place them inside the opening you left. Grab the farthest inside edge and pull the fabric through the hole. After you have gotten most of the fabric out of the hole, you can go back in with your fingers to poke the corners so that they are sharp and crisp.








Slowly pour in either dried beans, corn, or peas. You can tilt the bag, grab some with your hands, or pour them through the funnel.
You do not want to pack them tight. The beanbags are meant to be grabbed and handled, so it still needs to be slightly loose. Try to leave at least a 1/2 inch of fabric empty on the inside.

, Take the two loose edges of fabric and place them back underneath your sewing needle. Stitch a 1

Finish off your beanbag chair.",How to Make a Bean Bag2," This is totally up to you as to how wide you want your chair to be. Some people like beanbag chairs which are about the size of a normal chair. Others like the chair to be almost oversized, so that they can rest their arms on the excess fabric. The average width of an average beanbag chair is around 32 inches wide.42 inches wide will get you a large beanbag chair, while 56-70 inches will produce an extra large beanbag chair.
You may want to visit stores which sell beanbag chairs to measure each size of beanbag chair and see how they feel. Because this project is relatively easy, you can afford to make a mistake, and restart with a different size.

, The best thing to buy is a cotton-polyester blended fabric in your local arts and crafts store. Beanbag chairs that are available in stores are usually made with specially designed, elastic fabric which is not easily available. You can of course choose from any design they have available, such as solid colors, polka dots, stripes, animal prints, etc., All you have to do is add 4 inches to the total width of your chair. For example, let's assume that your diameter length will be 60 inches long. Add 4 inches to this length and you get 64 inches. Therefore, you will need to purchase either two separate pieces of fabric, each 64X64 inches, or one continuous piece of fabric that is 64X128 inches.You need two pieces of fabric to form the top and bottom of your chair. Don't worry if you buy one continuous piece of fabric. All you have to do is cut it in half using scissors when you get it home so that you have two even squares.
If the fabric is available directly off the bar, you can get it cut exactly the size you need. If however it is only available prepackaged, make sure you buy a piece of fabric that is larger than what you will need.

, If you have bought one large piece of fabric, now is the time to cut the piece in half so that you have two equal squares. You will then flip both pieces of fabric over on a safe, flat surface so that the design is facing down. Draw a circle on each piece of fabric. Both circles should have the same diameter. The diameter of your circles should be the desired width of your chair (as decided on earlier).If you need help drawing circles, please visit: How to Draw a Circle.
Once you have made a circle on each piece of fabric, cut them out with a pair of scissors.

, Place one circle face up on a flat surface. Place the other circle directly on top of the other circle, face down. Make sure to get the circles as closely matched up as possible. Take out your sewing machine. Place the edge of the two circles underneath the threaded needle.You will first make a 1/2 inch inseam around to stitch your circles together. Leave a hole at the end so that you can get your hand in between the circles. You will then go back in the opposite direction, this time sewing a 3/4 inch inseam. Once more, do not sew over the hole you will need to put your hand through.
After you have stitched your circles together, remove them safely from the sewing machine. Take a pair of scissors and trim off the excess fabric, about 1/4 inch close to the 1/2 inch inseam.

, First, put your hand through the hole you did not stitch. Reach all the way through and grab the seam on the other side. Pull the fabric through the hole flipping it inside-out (design should now be on the outside). Poke your hand back through the hole to push against the seams, and make sure the fabric is poked all the way out.Fill your beanbag chair with whatever you like. You can use standard stuffing material. You can use real beans. Polyester pellets are also a very popular item to use. All of these can be found at your local arts and crafts store.
Finally, sew the hole by hand. You will need a small, sharp needle and some embroidery floss which matches your other thread. For more information about how to stitch, visit: How to Sew

Measure your bed.,
Decide on the fullness for your bed skirt.,
Prepare your fabric.,
Cut your panels.,
Sew the hems.,
Prepare gathered panels.,
Sew the panels together.,
Attach the skirt panels to the main panel.,
Finish your bed skirt.",How to Make a Bed Skirt1," Take measurements for the width and depth of your bed, as well as the height from the floor to the top of your box spring. To sew bed skirts, you need 2 depth-by-height panels, 1 width-by-height panel for the skirt, and 1 width-by-depth panel to cover the top of your box spring.


Add 1 inch (2.54 cm) to the width and depth measurements and 2 inches (3 cm) to the height measurement for the seam allowance. You now have the measurements that you will use for your panels.;
, If you want to make a flat paneled bed skirt, then you may use the measurements you have. For a ruffled bed skirt, you need to account for fullness; determine how full you want the skirt to be, either 2 to 3 times fuller than a smooth/flat bedskirt. A fullness of 2 is mildly full, while a fullness of 3 is extremely full. Multiply the width measurements for the skirt panels by the amount of fullness you want. Use the resulting dimensions when cutting your fabric panels.

, Wash and dry it first to account for any shrinkage, then iron it so that it is flat and wrinkle-free. Measure and mark your panels using a ruler, straight edge and fabric marker.

, You should have a total of 4 panel pieces (3 for the skirt and 1 for the main panel) to cut.

, Press the bottom edge of the 3 skirt panel pieces up 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), with the wrong side in, in order to create the hem. Additionally, press the 2 depth edges and only 1 width edge of the main panel under, wrong side in, 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Use a straight stitch along the pressed edge to give a clean, finished look to your hem. This will also help prevent the bed skirt from fraying over time.

, If you are making a bed skirt with smooth/flat sides, then you don't need to do anything before sewing them to the main fabric piece. If you are choosing to make a ruffled bed skirt, then you will need to gather your panels before you sew them to the main panel. To make gathered panels:


Set your sewing machine to a zig-zag stitch, on the longest available stitch length. You will be stitching 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in from the top edge (opposite of the hemmed edge) of the skirt paneling.
Line up cotton crochet thread in the center of the presser foot so that, when you sew, the zig-zag stitch encloses the crochet thread. Make sure you do not sew the crochet thread into place, as you will need to pull it through the chamber made by the zig-zag stitching in order to create the gathering.
Sew along the entire length of the panel.
Pull the crochet thread from either end of the panel in order to gather the fabric until the panel is the appropriate width or depth measurement.
Adjust the gathers until they appear to be evenly spaced.
Sew a straight stitch along the gathered edge to secure the gathers in place.

, Beginning at the hem edge, pin 1 vertical end of each lengthwise skirt panel to each vertical end of the widthwise skirt panel, right sides facing together. Allowing for a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance, sew the panels together along the 2 connecting vertical edges. When you are finished, you will have 1 continuous bed skirt panel that spans the circumference of the bed (not including the head end).

, Lay the main panel in place. It should cover the entire face of the box spring and extend over the unfinished top edge of the bed skirt paneling. Pin the main panel to the bed skirt panel around the entire perimeter. Sew along the edge of the main panel on all 3 sides that are edged by the skirt panel, using a regular straight stitch. Be sure to use the 1/2-inch seam allowance.

, With the panels all sewn into place, put the bed skirt over the box spring to check its fit. If everything lies smoothly in place, then you are finished! Otherwise, remove the bed skirt and adjust any mistakes accordingly."
"
Use a fitted bed sheet as a bed skirt.,
Pin a long strip of fabric in place of a bed skirt.,
Try using a dropcloth.",How to Make a Bed Skirt2," If you're not up for sewing and want a fast and easy bed skirt, you can use a fitted bed sheet instead. Simply put the fitted sheet over the box spring instead of the mattress, and tuck the elastic band along the bottom under the box spring. Voila! You've now successfully covered the box spring with a sheet that already matches your bedding and decor.Using a fitted bed sheet will not cover any space under the box spring, meaning that under-the-bed storage will be exposed.

, If you want the ruffled look and storage cover of a real bed skirt without the sewing, you can simply pin some fabric in place. Measure the distance around the perimeter of your bed and the height from the floor to the top of the box spring, and cut a long strip of fabric that meets these dimensions. Pin this in place using straight pins along the edge of the box spring. Put the pins on the top of the box spring, so that when the mattress is replaced, you can't see that your skirt is actually just pinned in place.

, The final easy no-sew alternative to a traditional bed skirt, is using a piece of fabric large enough to cover the entirety of the box spring and then drape to the floor. The best option for this, without spending loads of money? A regular dropcloth. A linen dropcloth will cover the entire space of a queen size bed or smaller, and have enough excess fabric to reach the floor. Just spread the dropcloth out over your box spring, and use pins to hold it in place around the perimeter. You're done!"

Hang your net curtains and allow them to drip and dry.",How to Wash Net Curtains," Removing dust and dirt before cleaning your curtains can help you to get them looking as white as possible. A lot of dust and dirt can get trapped in your net curtains over time so it is very important to pre-treat them before washing.;
, Remove the curtain rod from the wall and slip the net curtains off one side of the rod.

, You will need to soak your net curtains for pre-treatment. In order to soak your curtains you will need to find a basin. You can also use a bathtub with a stopper in it if it works easier.

, Both vinegar and baking soda are powerful natural cleaners that can help you get your curtains looking white and bright. For maximum cleaning you will want to use both of these cleaners, but either one will work well.


Do not use vinegar and baking soda at the same time as they simply cancel each other out. One is an acid and the other is a base so mixing them results in a chemical reaction that reduces the cleaning ability of these chemicals.
Vinegar is great for removing smells and getting your nets a bright white color once again. They will also remove mildew and mold.
Baking soda is excellent at removing mildew and mold, can remove bad odors and will help whiten your curtains.

, Pour lukewarm water into the bucket or basin that you will be using for your soak. You will need enough water so that it covers the net curtain completely.

, Add one cup of vinegar to the basin. This will create a vinegar soak for your net curtain. If the smell of the vinegar bothers you then you can add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice to freshen the smell. The lemon juice will also help to clean the curtain.


Vinegar should not be used on curtains that are made from linen because it will burn them. Most modern inexpensive net curtains are made from polyester but if you are unsure whether your curtains have linen then you should skip this step.

, Place the net curtain into the vinegar soak and agitate it somewhat to allow the water and vinegar to mix completely and cover the curtain. You want all areas of the curtain to soak completely.

, Leave you net curtains to soak for an hour or overnight to soak completely. This should remove the dust and dirt as well as remove any odors that have gotten into your curtain.

, If you want to clean your curtain extra well or it is particularly dirty then you can create another soak. Fill the basin with lukewarm water and add one cup of baking soda. Soak the curtain for an hour or overnight. The baking soda will work to lift stains off your curtain and remove any remaining dirt or odors.

, Create a paste using four tablespoons of baking soda and ¼ cup of water. Apply this paste to your curtain and rub it into the stains. After working in the baking soda thoroughly into the stains, apply a little undiluted vinegar to the stains.


You can also use any commercial stain remover to apply to stains. Some net curtain manufacturers may recommend a certain stain remover to use., Now that the curtains have been rinsed of dirt and dust and any stains have been pretreated for removal, you can wash your curtains. Most curtains can be washed in a normal washing machine on the delicate cycle, especially if they are made from cotton or polyester. Most modern net curtains are made from polyester.


If you curtains are particularly delicate then you may have to hand wash them. Delicate curtains include those that are antiques or look like they might fall apart if washed. This also includes net curtains made from wool or silk, which should again be hand washed. Hand wash by placing in a basin of cool water with a little laundry detergent or dishwashing soap. Gently agitate the water to allow the soap to penetrate fully. Rather than squeezing out the delicate material, simply hang it up outside while wet and allow it to dry. This will prevent major wrinkles. Silk cannot be hung up to dry or else it will yellow. Rather roll the net curtain in a towel to remove excess water and then iron on low heat to dry., Any laundry detergent will do but one specifically developed for your fabric may work even better. For example you can use one that is made for delicate fabrics or for whites.


If you do not have a special detergent then that is fine. Because you have pretreated and pre-soaked your curtains, any stains should be removed already and your choice of detergent should not have a major impact.

, Put your curtain in the washing machine. If your curtain is particularly delicate you may need to hand wash and will thus need to place your curtain in a basin of cold water.

, You will need to bulk up the load when washing your curtain. This will help balance the load for optimum performance of your washing machine. This will also help tumble/agitate your washing load more efficiently, resulting in a better wash.

, Start your washing machine using warm or cold water on the delicate cycle. Add a normal amount of laundry detergent to the machine.


If you have a top-loader then you should add your washing powder after some water has filled into the machine.
If you wish, you can add 2-3 tablespoons of baking soda to the wash cycle to help the machine.

, Add your choice of fabric softener to the rinse cycle of your wash. Adding two tablespoons of vinegar to your rinse cycle will help make your curtains extra soft.Remove the curtains before spinning, or put them on very low spin so that they do not wrinkle.
Do not use vinegar with linen curtains or else it can burn them.

, Keep in mind not to tumble dry your net curtains, as this will cause them to shrink. Hang your curtains outside to dry them before rehanging them in your window. Alternatively you can simply hang up the damp curtains and allow them to dry while hanging.


It is difficult to iron net curtains without damaging them so try not to allow wrinkles to appear in the first place by hanging them to dry while still wet or damp.

,
Add any final, decorative touches to the hooded towel, if desired.",How to Make a Hooded Towel," Cheap, thin towels are easier to work with than thick, luxury towels. They also come in many different colors and patterns that might be appealing to kids.


Plan ahead. If you plan on making a super hero themed towel, base the towel on the super hero's cloak. For example, a Batman towel would be black or dark blue/purple, while a Superman towel would be red.;
, Fold the towel in half first, then cut it along the fold; this will give you a nice, straight edge. You will only be using one of these squares, so discard the other one or save it for another project.

, Use sewing pins to keep the edges in place, and remove the pins when you are done.Towels don't fray much, so you do not need to finish the hem. If you'd like to finish the seam, use a zigzag stitch along the edge.

, The seam you sewed should now be on the inside. This will be the top of the hood. The finished hem on the towel (usually embroidered) will be the bottom of the hood.


If there is a how-to-wash tag attached to the bottom hem of your hand towel, trim it off.

, You can leave the hood plain, or you can add a strip of rickrack or thick ribbon along the edge to frame the child's face. Lay a strip of ribbon or rickrack across the edge of hood, going from one bottom corner, across the top seam, and down to the other bottom corner. Pin it in place and topstitch it down. Remove the pins when you are done.


If you are using rickrack, sew it right down the middle of the rickrack.
If you are using wide ribbon, you will need to stitch along both sides of the ribbon. Try to get at close to the edge as possible. You can also use a heat-and-bond tape instead.

, This is completely optional, but it can add a fun look to the hooded towel. If you do not wish to add animal ears, skip down to the next part.

, Cut the ears 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) bigger than you want them to be to allow for seam allowances.


You can also use a different colored towel for the inside of the ears instead.

, If your ears are triangle shaped, clip the top points of the animal ears before turning them inside out. This will reduce bulk., Position the slits about 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from the edge.They can be as close together or as far apart as you'd like, but 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) from the top seam you sewed is a good rule of thumb.The slits should be the same width as the base of your animal ears.

, Make sure that the ears are sticking out of the top of the hood, and the bases are on the inside.

, Remove the pins when you are done, and trim off any loose threads.

, The easiest way to do this is to fold the towel in half, and place a pin along the top of the fold.Unfold the towel when you are done.


You may also want to find the midpoint of the hood as well; mark it along the bottom hem with a pin.

, Align the midpoints, and overlap the bottom hem of the hood with the top edge of the bath towel, making sure that the hood is on top. Secure the two towels with pins.


When you are done with the project, the bath towel's top edge will be on the outside of the hooded towel. The hood's bottom hem will be on the inside.
The hood is smaller than the bath towel, so there will be some extra space to either side of the hood.

,, You can add a border along the large bath towel, or iron an appliqué to the back. You can even cut the bath towel to make it look like a super hero cape!"

, Take down the curtains and unpick the stitches that join the lining to the curtain, going sufficiently high to allow you to work on the two new hems.


Make a note of the measurements of the existing curtain and lining hems, so that you can make the new hems the same size. These will often be double hems.

, Unpick the curtain hem, and trim excess fabric, allowing for the need to create a double hem if necessary. Turn it up to the marked length.


Check that it is level using the tape measure, then press.

Slip stitch in place. Repeat with the lining hem.

, Slip stitch the curtain and lining to re-join them.

Take accurate measurements.,
Determine the height of your curtains.,
Determine the final width.,
Decide on the number of panels you'd prefer.",How to Measure Fabric for Curtains1," Windows come in many different sizes. Because of this, there is no ""standard"" length and height. Use a metal tape measure to measure from one side of your window to the other. This is the window's width. Next, measure the window from top to bottom. This is its height.;
, You will likely need to add a few inches to your window's measurements, but this varies based on a few factors:


In general, curtains extend four inches below the window. If you would like that style of curtain, simply add four inches to the finished height. However, if you would like floor-length curtains, you must measure the distance from the window to the floor. Subtract one inch from this number and add the difference to the finished height.
If you are mounting curtains inside the window frame, measure down to ½ inch above the sill.

, If you plan to mount the rod inside the window frame, you do not need to add any measurements. If you are mounting the rod outside the window frame, select a location and adjust the width and height to match.


How far on either side do you wish your curtains to extend? Curtains generally go about four inches beyond the window on either side, meaning you will need to add eight inches in total to the finished width. However, if you want your curtains to match the curtain rod's length, measure that to get the finished width instead., If you have a fairly wide window, it's practical to make curtains that are two or more panels to cover the finished width instead of one long continuous piece of fabric. Divide the finished width by this number. Ideally, your chosen fabric will have a cut width equal to your desired panel widths. You can work with a shorter cut, but you will have extra sewing and cutting to do."

Take necessary extra fabric into account.,
Figure out your fullness ratio.,
Calculate your final width and height.,
Calculate your yardage.,
Pick your fabric.,
Account for pattern repeats.,
Reinforce the top of the curtain if necessary.",How to Measure Fabric for Curtains2," In addition to the size of your final curtains, you will need some additional fabric for other aspects like hems and headers. How much you add will be determined by the style of curtain you'd like to make.


Will your curtains have a decorative header at the top? You will need to add double the length of this header to the final height of your fabric.If you plan on hemming your fabric, add four times the length of the hem to the height and width needed. For example, a standard one-inch hem would add four inches to each length.

, Unless you want flat curtain panels, you will need a lot of extra fabric to account for pleats, waves, or gathered headings. Each curtain style has its own ""fullness ratio,"" which you will need to multiply your finished width by. Fullness ratios for common curtain styles include:


Flat curtain panels = 1.0
Eyelet curtains = 1.35
Wave curtains = 2.2
Gathered headings = 1.8
Pencil pleat = 2.0, By now you have a lot of different numbers to work with but may be unsure of how to put them all together. Use a pencil and paper to write out your calculations.


For example, let's say you're working with a 48""-wide, 36""-tall window with a curtain rod 6"" above. You want standard 4"" overlays (both vertical and horizontal), 1/2"" hems, and a fullness ratio of 1.8 for a gathered heading style. You would like your curtains to be broken up into two panels.
Your final estimated width would be: The width (48"") plus twice the overlay (4""). You would then divide this length (56"") by the number of panels (2). Next, add four times the hem (0.5""). Finally, multiply this final number (30"") by the fullness ratio (1.8), yielding a width of 54"". This can also be expressed with the equation 1.8 x ((48 + 2 x 4)/2 + 4 x 0.5) = 54.
Your final estimated height would be a much simpler: Just add the height of the window (36"") to four times the hem (0.5"") along with the overlay (4"") and distance to the rod (6""). In this example, you would need to buy 48 inches (120 cm) of fabric. This can also be expressed as the equation 36 + 4 x 0.5 + 4 + 6 = 48.

, Fabric is usually sold by the whole yard. To figure out how many yards you'll need to buy, multiply your final height by the number of panels needed. Next, divide this number by 36 (there are 36 inches in a yard). Round up to the nearest whole yard.


Using the previous example: Take the final height (48"") and multiply it by the number of panels needed (2). Divide this length (96"") by the number of inches in a yard (36""), giving you a minimum yardage of 2.67. The equation used here would be (48 x 2)/36 = 2.67 yards (2.44 m). This number rounded up would be 3 total yards.

, Fabric is typically sold in varying widths. To make things easier, try to pick a fabric with a width close to the final panel width of your curtains. It's perfectly fine to use a fabric with a width a few inches longer than the final width, but definitely don't pick one that's shorter.

, If you're making curtains with multiple panels and your chosen fabric has a pattern, you will want to make sure the pattern lines up perfectly between panels. To do this, you will need to modify your calculations slightly. Start by determining the vertical repeat of the pattern. This is typically listed on the fabric's product information. Divide your final height by the vertical repeat. If the resulting quotient isn't a whole number, you'll need to adjust your yardage.


Using the previous example with a vertical repeat of 12.5 inches (31.8 cm): Divide the final height (48"") by the vertical repeat (12.5), which is 3.84. This number rounded up would be 4.
You will need to calculate your yardage again using 4 times the vertical repeat (or 50"") in place of the final length.
The number yards you'll need to buy would be: (50 x 2)/36 or 2.78 yards. Rounded up, this number is 3 yards. Luckily, in this instance you would be paying for the same amount of fabric as you would if it wasn't patterned.If you skip this step, you will end up with curtains with patterns that don't match up. If that's the look you want, then go for it. However, in general, patterned curtains that are out of synch look sloppy and unprofessional.

, Generally, you'll want to reinforce the top of the curtain with an extra layer of fabric or interfacing. If you have a narrow rod to insert through a fabric tunnel at the top of the curtain, you may skip this step.

However, if you're covering a larger window, you may want two curtains that part in the middle. For an extra-large window, you may want to consider multiple curtain panels.


When you're taking your widthwise measurements, be sure to divide the final number by the number of panels you want before cutting your fabric. For instance, if you need 30 feet (9.1 m) to cover a window and you want three separate panels, each panel must be 10 feet (3 m) wide (30 ÷ 3 = 10).;
, You have a lot of choice when it comes to choosing fabrics for curtains, but you should take into account what kind of effect you want to achieve. For instance:To add a bit of privacy without blocking out too much light, choose a lighter weight material that has some transparency, such as voile or linen.
To block out light or drafts, choose a heavier material, such as velvet, corduroy, tapestry, or damask.
For an ultra-lightweight curtain in areas where you don’t need privacy, try lace, chiffon, or organza.

, Measure the width of the window you're covering from the outer edge of the frame on one side to the outer edge of the frame on the other side. Multiply that by two or 2.5, depending on how full you want the closed curtains to look. Then add another four inches (101 mm) for the side hem.








If you are making multiple panels, add four inches (101 mm) to each panel for the side hem.

, Measure from the top of the curtain rod to the very top of the window frame. This is important because you want to ensure your curtains completely cover the top of the window. Therefore, when hung over the curtain rod, the finished tabs must be shorter than this gap., First, measure the distance from the top of the curtain rod to the spot where you want the finished curtain to end.Add nine inches (228 mm) to that measurement to account for the hems,and then subtract four inches (101 mm) to account for the tabs.In general, curtains will hang to one of four locations:Right to the floor, which is for formal or classy rooms.
To the floor plus an extra one to six inches (depending on taste), for a stylish and romantic effect.
To the top of the bottom window sill, which is ideal for kitchens and bathrooms.
To the bottom of the window trim, which is also great for practical areas like kitchens.

, You need one tab at each end of the curtain, and then in between you should have a tab every five to eight inches.To figure out how many tabs you need, divide the finished width of your curtain by the spacing measurement of your tabs, then add one.


For instance, if you have a finished curtain of 30 inches, and you want tabs spaced at every five inches, you need seven tabs for that curtain (30 ÷ 5 + 1 = 7).

, When you sew the tabs on your curtains, you'll be left with a raw edge that you'll cover with a piece of facing. To make this, cut out a piece of fabric that’s four inches (101 mm) wide and the length of your curtains plus two inches (51 mm).







, Once you have all your measurements and calculations, you can cut your fabric to those dimensions and begin sewing. Don’t forget to cut out the curtains, the tabs, and the tab facing.









For a basic tab, cut out rectangles of fabric that are five inches by nine inches (127 mm by 228 mm). This will leave you with tabs that are two inches by eight inches (203 mm), and folded tabs that are four inches (101 mm) long., Fold each tab in half lengthwise so that the right sides (the good sides of the fabric) face each other. Pin the sides in place, and use the sewing machine to sew a straight stitch along the lengthwise edges of the fabric. Use a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance, and don’t forget to backstitch at the beginning and end of every new seam.








Press the seam open with a hot iron, then turn the tab right-side out. Position the seam in the center and press the whole tab flat.

, On each side of the curtain, fold the edge over (wrong sides together) one inch (2.5 cm) and press it in place. Fold this over another inch and press it again. Sew the hem at a three-quarter-inch (1.9 cm) seam allowance, and press it when you're finished.







, Measure out the desired spacing for your tabs, marking where the center of each tab will go with a fabric marker or chalk. Fold the tabs in half (with the seam on the inside) and place them upside down on the curtain, lining up the raw edges of each tab with the raw edge of the top of the curtain. Pin the tabs in place.









Sew each tab to the top of the curtain using a half-inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance.

, Fold the side (widthwise) edges of the facing over one inch (2.5 cm) and press them in place. Then fold up the bottom (lengthwise) edge one-half inch (1.27 cm) and press them.








, Lay the facing right-side down over the curtain top and the tabs, lining up the raw edges. Pin the facing in place and sew along the top at a half-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance.









Open up the fabric at the seam and press the tabs and the facing upward. Then fold the facing piece down behind the curtain and press it again. Pin it in place, and top stitch around all the edges., At this point, it’s a good idea to hang the curtains in case you need to adjust the length of the hem at all. Take the curtains down when you have finished checking., Fold the hem up four inches and press it in place. Fold that up another four inches and press that too. Position the edge of the presser foot along the top edge of the fold and top stitch the hem.








, Once you're happy with the finished product, you can get your curtains up and decorating your window!

Select a fabric to meet your lighting purposes.,
Choose a texture of fabric.,
Get creative with your fabric.",How to Make Unlined Curtains1," Because your curtains are going to be unlined, they will still allow some sunlight through.


For the lightest look, choose curtains made of lace or a sheer cloth. These will allow the most light through while still showing a simple pattern or color.
If you want to block out sunlight, look for a heavy linen fabric. Even without being lined this fabric will dampen the amount of light shining through them, making your room much darker.
If you choose a fabric that is patterned, try to find one that is patterned only on one side or that has an identical pattern on both sides. This is because when the sun shines through the fabric, it will cause you to see both patterns at once, making it appear very disorienting.
Using a fabric with a high thread count (500+) is more expensive, but will block the most sunlight because it is tightly woven.;
, Although you may not be touching your curtains all the time, the texture of the fabric gives a different appearance when hung in the light.


Cotton and polyester fabrics are the most basic for curtain use, and the easiest to sew.
Avoid using silk or satin, as they will deteriorate in the sunlight.
Sewing jersey knit fabrics is very difficult as they stretch when pulled. They will also begin to puddle on the floor after being hung because of their elasticity.
Don’t choose a fabric that is too stiff, as it won’t drape when hung. An example of this is tulle, which offers a pretty option for sheer fabric, but is much too inflexible.

, You don’t have to purchase your fabric at a fabric store, look in second-hand, vintage, and consignment shops for great fabric.


Try finding vintage tablecloths in the size you need to fit your window. These offer a fun mod look to your room.
Using patterned sheets is a cheap alternative to buying yardage of fabric. You can look for brand new or vintage sheets in antique or consignment shops.

Measure your hem.,
Apply iron-on tape to one side of the curtain.,
Use an iron to stick the tape to the fabric.,
Continue ironing all four edges.,
Attach clip-on rings.,
Hang your curtains.",How to Make Unlined Curtains2," In order to know where to measure your fabric, you need to know from how high you will be hanging it.


To give the illusion of high ceilings, hang the curtain rod as near to the ceiling as you can, or a foot or more above the top of your window.
If you want your curtains to puddle on the floor, measure them 6–12 inches (15.2–30.5 cm) longer than the total length from the curtain rod to the floor.

, Depending on what appearance you are looking for, the width of the fabric may differ.


If you want your panels to completely cover your window, each should measure the width of half the window plus two inches. For example, if your window is 48 inches (121.9 cm) wide, then each panel should be 24 inches (61.0 cm) plus an extra two each, 26 inches (66.0 cm) for each.
If your panels are only ornamental, measure them to be 1/4 of the total width of the window.

, You will want it to measure about half an inch in on every side. You will create the hem by folding the edge of the fabric over, thus giving a clean edge to the curtain.

, The tape should meet the edge of where the hem will begin, so that you can fold the edge of the fabric over and use the iron-tape to secure the folded section.

, Make sure your fold is straight, and hem the edge with the tape in between. Iron over the folded top so that the heat can cause the tape to stick to the two pieces.

, If necessary, apply extra ironing tape at the corners to get them to stick.

, Evenly space them along the top of the curtain to allow for even draping.

, Slide the clip-on rings over the curtain rod and adjust the hang to meet your aesthetic preferences. Enjoy!"

Sew the width of the curtains.,
Apply the heading tape.,
Fold over the top six inches to create a loop.,
Sew along the top, creating a loop.,
Hem the bottom.,
Hang your curtains.",How to Make Unlined Curtains3," Similar to no-sew curtains, you need to decide how much of the window you want covered and then give an extra allowance for the hem.


Allow six inches of extra fabric at the top of the curtains to create the loop for the curtain rod.
Sewing a hem requires less extra fabric to fold over than an iron-on hem, so feel free to reduce the folded edge to only a few centimeters, at least two minimum though.

, You need to create a distinct fold for the hem to make it easier to sew. Pin the hem in place with straight pins.

, You can hand stitch or use a sewing machine, but the latter will take significantly less time. Sew along the hem that you just ironed, removing the pins as you go.

, Follow the same rules as above by ironing along the hem and removing pins as you go.

, Measure the tape to match the width of the curtains, and iron onto the top of the panel. This will stiffen the top edge, making it sturdier for hanging.

, If your curtain rod is larger, adjust this by adding more fabric for the loop.

, Make sure the loop is even all the way across, or else it will not allow the curtain rod to go through or will drape unevenly.

, Take down the curtain and turn up a double hem to the marked length and press.


To make a neat finish at the lower corners, open out the folds at the sides (unpick the side hem you've already sewn), and the hem.
Fold in the corner at an angle, then carefully refold all the turnings to make a 'mitered corner'. Hand-sew the hem and the miter (you can use the machine if you’re in a hurry).

, Slide the rod through the loop you’ve created, and drape the curtains to match your taste. Enjoy your newly made curtains!"

,
Cut out your fabric adding 1/2"" to each side and 4"" to the length.

,
Take your lining and mark out your measurements for the tube tape (show below) with pins.,
Keep in mind that tube tape is a fantastic product that has little loops along the top of the tape for running nylon cord through (as shown above) and a pocket along the bottom (shown below) where you can insert a dowel.,
Pin down the tube tape.,
Pin your tape down with the bottom of the tape right above the marking pin (as shown on the right).,
Lay your next row of tape down, once again above the pin marking (refer to above photo).,
Continue laying out and pinning your rows of tape until you have five rows completed.,
Baste your tape onto the lining.,

Pull your blind up and adjust the folds.",How to Make Roman Blinds,"


A crisp press makes a sewing project so much easier!
Always press both the fabric and lining.;
,,,


The first row of tape should be 5 inches (12.7 cm) from the bottom.






The next row should be 8 inches (20.3 cm) up and repeat with three more rows 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.







,


If you are still unsure of what you are looking for, ask for tube tape used for roman blinds at your fabric store and they should hopefully know what you're looking for.

, Pin the tape to the right side of the lining and start at the bottom.

, Keep measuring as you pin your tape across the width of the lining, making sure you are keeping the tape straight.

, As you work your way across, pinning the tape down, measure 8"" from the top of the tape to the top of the tape below and you will be able to make sure you are continuing to pin in a straight line.

, You should have about 13"" of fabric left after your fifth row of tape. You don't want to go too close to the top of your fabric or things will look very wonky when you're at the finishing stages!

, You can use bright colored thread in this tutorial for demonstration purposes, but you certainly don't have to. Just make sure when you are basting, that you stitch right along the top of the tape and avoid stitching over the little loops.

, Pin the right sides together, and stitch the sides and bottom together with a 1/2"" seam, leaving the top open.

, You're going to feel like a professional seamstress when you see your shade coming together! Press the edges of the shade out flat.

,,


The main thing you need to look for when choosing a slat, is that it is sturdy, yet slim. For this particular fabric blinds, Hubs had some plastic slats from an old mini blind hanging around, and it worked perfectly! It was flexible and yet wouldn't break - which is something you need to watch for if you use a wooden slat. If it is too thin, it can snap.






A 1/4"" thickness would be perfect. The width of the slat should not be greater than 1.25"".



, Stitch a pocket to keep the slat in place, which you can do either by hand or by machine.


For this blind, try using a zipper foot and stitch with the machine. This is by far the most challenging step (if done by machine) as you need to make sure you are far enough away from the wall to accommodate the slat sticking out behind you and in front of you, as you stitch.Stitching by hand will alleviate this problem, but it does take longer.







, This time, you'll be stitching through all the fabric so make sure your top thread and bobbin thread match the fabrics! (Bobbin thread should match the shade fabric and top thread should match the lining.) Once again, pin the tape and fabric together, making sure everything is smooth and flat.

,


Try pinning and stitching one row at a time, removing the basting before continuing on to the next row.This way you can be sure to pull the fabric smooth between each row and ensure a better finished product.

,, To be honest, this part is optional.


The shade will work just fine without covering the board...it just won't look as nice! At any rate, if you choose to cover it...wrap it much the same as you would wrap a gift...just use staples instead of tape! Tuck those ends in and staple them neatly too!

,,, Trim the excess fabric down about 1/2"" away from the velcro, as shown. Attach the velcro on the shade to the velcro on the board.

, Predrill. You want each of the screws to be roughly 10"" apart. Try pre-drilling right in the middle of the board, and then again in the middle of the two ""sections"". It should look something like what's shown in the picture.

,


You will need to tie a bulky knot - and this is important because you don't want that knot eventually pulling through the loops on the tube tape.






Try knotting it about three times, and then thread the cord through a large blunt needle. Again, start at the bottom of the opposite side you want your cord drop. Measure 2"" in from the edge and pull your needle through a loop on the bottom row of tube tape.



, Just run some stitches through it all and eliminate a possible headache down the road.

, You may need to trim down the length of the dowels to fit neatly inside the tape, and that can easily be done with a utility knife.

, It takes a few days to ""train"" the fabric to lie down into nice folds, especially if the fabric is thick.


Try using a light blocking liner.

How full your curtains are is a matter of taste. The average fullness is calculated by taking the total length of the curtain rod (sized to fit your window) and multiplying that number by 1.5. You can multiply by 2 for fuller curtains.

, This gives you the size of each of the 2 curtain panels you need.

Again, this is a matter of taste. Two panels are normal, but, if you want more, just divide the total width by the number of panels you want to hang.
You need to add 2 inches (5 cm) for each panel to the width of the curtain panels for seams and finishing.

",How to Make Kitchen Curtains," You have a few choices when it comes to kitchen window treatments.


Curtains. These are 2 gathered panels that hang from top to bottom, framing the window on both the left and right sides.
Valances. A valance is a panel that spans horizontally over the only the upper portion of the window, leaving the lower part of the window undressed.
Privacy tiers. Tiers are single-panel window treatments designed to block only the lower 1/2 or 2/3 of the window. They are often used in combination with a valance.;
, Record the measurements for your window's length and width. If you want to create a privacy tier, also measure the distance from the vertical center-point to the bottom of the window.

, This will determine how much fabric you need to purchase. Generally speaking, the fuller the curtain, the more opulent it feels. A fullness of 1 1/2 equates to a flat panel and a fullness of 3 is a luxuriously gathered panel.

, Follow these guidelines to calculate the yardage of fabric that you will need.


Multiply your fullness (1 1/2 to 3) by the width of your window. For example, if your window is 2 foot (0.6 m), then you will need a 4 foot (1.2 m) length of fabric for each full-sized panel you intend to create.
Remember that a valance and a privacy tier are each one full-sized panel.
If you are planning to sew curtains, your panel length will be 1/2 of the full-sized panel length and you will need 2 panels per window.
Add at least 2 inches (5 cm) to the width and 6 inches (15 cm) to the length of your valance, tier or curtain design to account for seams, rod pockets and hems. You may adjust that number, depending on your design and the size of your rod.

, When you make kitchen curtains, you must keep in mind the practicality factor. You should not use any fabric that will shrink or fade easily, or that cannot be washed. It is also a good idea to choose a flame-retardant fabric, just in case of cooking mishap.

,,,,


Fold the lower edge of your panel up 0.5 inch (1.25 cm), wrong side in, and press.
Fold the clean edge up, facing the wrong side of the fabric, to the desired hem amount (keeping in mind the amount you allotted when you cut your panel) and press again.
Stitch the top folded edge of the hem to secure it in place.

,


Fold the vertical edges 0.5 inch (1.25 cm) on each side, wrong side in, and press.
Double the fold to conceal the rough edge and press again.
Sew along the edge of the fold to secure the hem.

,


Fold the upper edge of your panel in 0.5 inch (1.25 cm), wrong side in, and press.
Fold the clean edge under (wrong side in) again, allowing enough room to compensate for the width of the rod you will be using, and press again.
Stitch as near to the folded edge as possible to finish the rod pocket. Once you finish this step, your panel is complete.

Cut a 5 by 22-inch (12.7 by 55.88-centimeter) strip out of fabric.Choose a color and pattern that matches your curtains.,
Fold the fabric strip in half lengthwise with the right sides facing inward.,
Sew along two of the edges, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Turn the curtain tieback inside out.,
Tuck the raw edge in, then press the entire tieback flat with an iron.If the raw edge won't stay tucked inside the tieback, secure it with pins.

,
Topstitch all the way around the tieback, ¼-inch (0.64centimeter) away from the edge.Use a color that matches your fabric; you can also use a contrasting color if you'd like something more interesting.,
Hand sew a small, plastic or metal ring to the top left and top right corners of your tieback.Make sure that the rings are big enough to fit over the wall hooks.,
Decorate the curtain tiebacks, if desired.,
Use the curtain tiebacks.",How to Make Curtain Tiebacks1," This will be enough to make one fabric tieback. If you'd like to make a another, simply cut a second piece of fabric.


If you'd like to make larger tiebacks, try 9 by 30 inches (22.86 by 76.2 centimeters) instead.;
, Press the strip flat with an iron, using a heat setting that is suitable for the fabric you are working with.

, Sew along the long edge and one of the narrow edges. Leave the other narrow edge open so that you can turn the curtain tieback inside out.

, Use a chopstick, knitting needle, or some other blunt tool to push the curtain tieback inside out. To reduce bulk and prevent bunching, snip the corners of the seams first, just be careful not to cut through the stitching.

,, Be sure to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling.

, If you don't have any wall hooks, you'll want to mount some to either side of your curtain. The hooks should be the same color as your wall so that they blend in.

, Find a pretty silk or fabric flower that matches your curtain, and hot glue it to the front corner of your tieback. You can also get several flowers, and attach them to the tieback with snaps. This way, you can change out flowers as the seasons change., Hook the tieback onto the wall hook. Pull the curtain towards the wall, then wrap the tieback around it. Hook the other side of the tieback onto the hook.

Cut a 22-inch (55.88-centimeter) long piece of flexible, aluminum wire.Use a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters to do this.,
Slide the end of the wire through a metal ring, leaving a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) tail.,
Wrap the tail end around the wire tightly.,
String on 1 to 1½ inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) worth of spacer beads.,
Start stringing on your other beads.,
String on 1 to 1½ inches (2.54 to 3.81 centimeters) worth of spacer beads.,
Attach the other ring.,
Use the curtain tiebacks.",How to Make Curtain Tiebacks2," The type of wire used to hang pictures would be ideal, because it is strong to hold back curtains, yet thin enough to go through an acrylic bead. This is enough to make one beaded curtain tieback. If you'd like to make more, you'll have to repeat this method for each one that you make.


Consider making 3 to 5 beaded strings, each one a little shorter than the other, and tying them all onto the same ring. This will created a tiered effect.

, The ring needs to be big enough to fit over the metal hook mounted on your wall. Something that is about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide would be ideal.


If you do not have a tieback hook, you should mount one. It does not need to be very big.

, With each turn, use a pair of flat-nose pliers to push the wrapped wire up towards the ring. You want it to be as snug as possible. When you have about ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) left, use your pliers to tuck the tail into the wrapped wire.

, You will need about 5 to 8 spacer beads for this.The beads need to be small, but not so small that you can't fit them over the wire.

, If you have a focal bead, put it in the center. When you are 5 to 5½ inches (12.7 to 13.97 centimeters) away from the end, stop. Acrylic beads are recommended, because they are less-likely to chip or break if they fall.

, Again, you will need about 5 to 8 spacer beads for this. You will end up with a 4-inch (10.16 centimeter) long tail.

, Slide the end of the wire until you have a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) long tail. Wrap it tightly around the wire, as before, and tuck the excess into the coils. You will have some wire visible between the beads and the coils. If you don't want this, then start wrapping with a longer tail. Snip off any excess wire when you are done.

, Hook the ring part of the tieback onto a wall hook. Pull the curtain towards the wall, then wrap the tieback around it. Hook the other end of the tieback onto the hook.


If you have not already done so, mount a small wall hook to either side of your window.

Trace a circle onto a sheet of sturdy cardboard.,
Trace a smaller circle inside the first one.,
Cut the ring out using a craft blade.,
Secure the end of a ribbon to the back of the ring with some hot glue or fabric glue.,
Start wrapping the ribbon around the ring.,
Secure the end of the ribbon to the back of the ring with hot glue or fabric glue.,
Decorate the ring, if desired.,
Wrap some matching ribbon around a chopstick to make the pin.,
Decorate the top, wider part of the pin, if desired.,
Use the tieback.",How to Make Curtain Tiebacks3," You can make the circle using a compass or a small plate. You can also use a CD instead. The circle should be between 4.75 and 5 inches (12.1 and 12.7 centimeters) wide.


Use a thin, but stiff, cardboard, such as mounting board or illustration board.
The color does not matter; however, if you plan on using a light-colored ribbon, you may want to choose a light color for your cardboard.

, The circle should be about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) smaller than the first one, and placed right in the center. You will end up with a 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) thick ring.


For a more delicate-looking tieback, make the circle 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) smaller, so that you end up with a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick ring.

, Cut the larger circle out first, then cut the smaller one. Save the ring, and discard the small circle.

, You will be winding the ribbon around the ring, so glue the ribbon at a slight angle. Choose a ribbon that is between ½ and 1-inch (1.27 and 2.54 centimeters) wide. The ribbon an be either satin or grosgrain; avoid sheer or lace ribbons.


Pick a color that contrasts with your curtains. If your curtains have a pattern on them, match the color either to the background or to the pattern.
For a rustic theme, use jute twine.

, Overlap the ribbon with each turn, so that you don't get any gaps., Once you are back where you started, cut off the excess ribbon with a pair of scissors, then glue the end down to the back of the ring.

, Your ring will have a top, bottom, left, and right side. You can only decorate the top and bottom. If you decorate the left and right sides, you won't be able to slide the pin through it. Use hot glue or fabric glue to attach your decorations. Pearl beads, silk flowers, and ribbon flowers are great choices! Make sure that the decorations match the color of your ring or the color/theme of your curtain.


For a rustic theme, use flat-backed seashells, sand dollars, and starfish.
Use different sizes for a more interesting design. Place the larger flowers/beads towards the middle, and the smaller ones towards the edges.
Don't get carried away; less is more!

, Place a dot of glue at one end of the chopstick, and press the end of your ribbon into it. Start wrapping the ribbon around the chopstick, overlapping it with each turn. When you reach the other end, cut off the excess ribbon, and glue the end down.Choose a color that is the same color as your ring, or a contrasting one.
Try to cover both ends of the chopstick with ribbon as well to conceal any raw wood.

, Choose smaller versions of the decorations you used on your ring, and glue them to the top of the pin using hot glue or fabric glue. You don't need to decorate all the way around the pin; just the front will be enough. Don't decorate more than 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters), or the pin won't be able to go through the curtain.


If you weren't able to cover both ends of the chopstick with ribbon, you can hide the raw wood with a dab or paint or nail polish. Choose a color that matches your ribbon, then let it dry.

, This tieback works in a similar fashion to those ring-shaped brooches. Here is how you use it:


Position the ring in front of the curtain panel.
Gather the curtain in your hand, and push a small part of it through the ring.
Place tip of chopstick pin in front of the ring.
Slide the pin behind the gathered curtain, and out the other side. Make sure that the tip of the pin is in front of the ring.

Make sure you have enough fabric for a double-folded hem.,
Spread the curtain, wrong-side-up on a flat surface.,
Fold your bottom up and press it flat with an iron.,
Fold your hem up again and press it flat with an iron.,
Keep the lining separate from the hem.,
Consider using iron-on hem tape to fuse the hem to the curtain.,
Consider using a sewing machine to sew the hem.",How to Hem Curtains1," Curtain hems are folded twice at the bottom, so you will need twice as much fabric for the hem. This means that you will need to cut your curtains longer than you want them to be. The longer the curtain is, the wider the hem needs to be; this will help make it look more proportionate.


Standard curtains have a 3 to 4 inch (7.62 10.16 centimeters) wide hem. You'll need to cut your curtains 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) longer than you want them to be.Shorter curtains might look better with a 2 inch (5.08 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) longer than you want them to be.Longer curtains, such as floor to ceiling, might look better with a 5 inch (12.7 centimeter) wide hem. Cut your curtains 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) longer than you want them to be.;
, Because of their size, it might be easier to spread your curtains on the floor. If you have a very large table and a small curtain, however, you can work on the table.

, How far you fold it up depends on how wide you want your hem to be. For example, if you want a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) wide hem, fold the bottom up by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). Use sewing pins to hold the fabric in place while you iron it. Be sure to remove the pins when you are done ironing.

, Be sure that you are folding it up by the same amount as last time. For example, if you just folded your hem up by 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) earlier, fold it up by that same amount again. Pin the hem in place and press it flat with an iron. You have just folded your double hem.

, The lining is usually hemmed on its own. It is tucked into the side hems, but not into the bottom hem. Click here to learn how to hem a curtain lining.

, Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the width of your curtain.Slip it inside the hem, right between the back of the curtain and the folded hem. Align the top of the hem tape with the top of the folded hem. Iron the hem down. Press down with the iron for 10 seconds at a time before moving on to the next section.Most hem tapes will require a wool setting. Different brands will require different settings, however. Refer to the packaging from your hem tape for the proper setting.To prevent the fabric from burning, consider placing a damp cloth between the iron and the curtain.Some hem tapes have adhesive on one side, and a paper back on the other. You will need to iron it twice: first with the paper backing on, and then with the paper backing peeled off.You may find hem tape also labeled as stitch-witchery, iron-on hem tape, or fusible fabric tape.

, Try to sew as close to the top folded edge as you can. Use a color that matches the curtain color as closely as possible.

Consider using a sewing machine to sew the hem.",How to Hem Curtains2," Standard curtain panels have a 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side. The hem is folded twice, on both sides, so each panel will need to be 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wider than you want them to be. This will allow you to create a double 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) wide hem on each side., The easiest way to do this would be to mark off 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters) at the top and bottom of your curtain, and then to fold it. Use sewing pins to hold the hem down.

, Be sure to press the hem with an iron each time. If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place.

, If your curtain has a lining, cut your lining down to the width of your curtain, then tuck the raw edges into the hem.

, Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the length of your curtain. Slip it inside the hem. Align the edge of the hem tape with the edge of the folded hem. Iron the hem down.

Curtain linings are about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the curtain. Plan accordingly., Curtain linings are usually tucked into the side hem. If you are hemming a store-bought curtain, this could be a problem, depending on how short you are cutting and hemming your curtain. Use a seam ripper to undo the bottom portion of each side hem, and trim the lining down to the length you need. You will tuck it back into the side hems later.

, How much you fold it up will depend on how wide you want the hem to be. For example, if your hem to be 3 inches (7.62 centimeters), fold it up by 3 inches (7.62 centimeters). If necessary, use sewing pins to hold the hem in place. Be sure to remove the pins once you are done ironing.


Make sure that you are folding the hem inside the curtain. You do not want the hem to be visible from the outside.
The bottom edge of the lining should rest 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) above the bottom edge of the curtain when you are done. The bottom edges of the curtain and the lining should not be aligned.

, Cut a piece of hem tape slightly shorter than the width of your lining. Tuck it inside the hem, aligning the top edge with the top of the folded hem. Iron the hem down.

, Try to sew as close to the top folded edge as you can. Use a color that matches the lining color as closely as possible.

, Add 2 inches (5 cm) of seam allowance to the length measurement. For a 72-inch (1.8-m) long window, the fabric and lining should each be 74 inches (1.88 m) long.

Determine the width of the fabric and lining.
Divide the window width plus seam allowance by the width of the fabric that you have. For a window 36 inches (91.4 cm) wide with a 2-inch (5-cm) seam allowance, and fabric 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide, the result is 3.2.
Round the total up to a whole number. This is the number of fabric panels you will need to make your blinds. If the number is 3.2, you will need 4 widths of fabric in the length determined.
Repeat the calculation to determine how many panels of lining you will need to make your blinds.

, Cut out the determined amounts of fabric and lining.,

Sew together the panels of fabric lengthwise.
Sew together the panels of lining lengthwise.

,

, Slide a dowel between the bottom rows of stitching., The right sides of the blind should face outwards.,

Lay the blind flat with lining facing up.
Use a tape measure and pencil to mark a line 2 inches (5 cm) below the top of the blind.
Draw horizontal lines spaced equally over the rest of the blind. Each line should be between 8 and 12 inches (20.3 and 30.5 cm) apart.
Ensure that the final bottom section of the blind is half the distance between the other lines.

, For each space between the horizontal lines, cut a strip of matching fabric. The fabric should be as wide as the width of the blinds and 3 inches (7.6 cm) high.,

Join the edges of the pocket. The wrong side of the fabric should face outwards.
Sew together the long edge and 1 shorter edge of the pocket.

Multiply the length of the blinds by 2. For a 72-inch (1.8-m) blind, the result is 144 inches (3.6 m).
Add the width of the blinds. A 36-inch (91.4-cm) wide blind gives you 180 inches (4.6 m).
Multiply this number by 3. Using the measurements above, the result is 540 inches (13.8 m).
Cut the needed length of cord.
Cut the cord into 3 equal lengths.
Tie the end of each cord to 1 of the bottom plastic rings on the blind.
Bring each cord up through the vertical line of plastic rings and the eyelet above each line.
Bring all of the cords through the fourth eyelet on the side of the blind.

, Press the fabric fastener on the blind to the fabric fastener on the wall. The back side of the blind should face the window., Pull the cords until the blind has reached the height you desire.

, While these can be made with light weight materials, decorator weight is ideal.


""Decorator weight"" is a bit heavier -- think the weight of a tablecloth.

, Add an inch (2.54 cm) in both height and width to the size of the window opening.


The extra material is for seam allowances.
Outer fabric can be cut a little wider so that it ""wraps"" around each side as a margin on the back side of the shade.

, Make sure printed or ""right"" sides are facing.


You may want to sew fabric tape to the lining fabric to make channels for inserting the battens rather than gluing (as noted in following steps).

, Leave several inches open for turning the fabric ""right"" side out when done.


Miter (cut off) the seam allowances at the corners so that it will turn cleanly and it won't bunch up in the corner.
If outer fabric is wider to create a margin on the back, sew the sides together.
Hem the bottom by hand and use iron-on hem tape at the top; it will not be seen.

,


As you iron, take care that the front (or ""focus"" fabric) covers the lining fabric at the edges so that the lining fabric does not show.

, Sew a strip of Velcro across the top of edge of the material.


This will be used later to attach the fabric to the wood.

, Make marks where you want the horizontal pleats/folds to fall.


Glue ""battens"" or thin strips of stiffening material horizontally across your fabric at the pleat marks.
Some shade makers will unpick the seams at the sides of the shade fabric and slide the battens between the layers to hide them.
Some batten materials could include: old mini-blinds slats, 1/8 metal rods, furring strips, paneling trip strips, etc.
While you can do without these battens, you may be sadly disappointed in the sag of your shade pleats without them.

, This should take around 20 minutes.


Or, as stated above, stitch pockets for the battens to slide into, by sewing parallel lines across the shade at the pleat marks.

, Space them evenly in at least two vertical lines.


Most fabric stores will sell a cotton tape with plastic loops already attached for this purpose, saving a step.
Take care to fasten the loops securely to the shade.

, They should be twice the height of the window in length.


Tie the cord(s) securely to the bottom loop on each vertical line of loops.
Thread the cords vertically through the sewn-on loops.
Insert a screw-eye bolt to the 1x1 at each point where the vertical lines touch it.

, Use either Velcro or staples.

, Keep fabric laying flat and run each of the cords through their own screw-eye at the top.


Run all cords through all screw eyes at the top to bring them all over to one side to be used for raising and lowering the shade.
Knot cords together just beyond the last screw-eye and ""train"" the fabric to fall in neat folds.
Press with an iron, if desired.
Pull the cord gently and ""train"" the fabric to fall in neat folds.

Drill a small hole into the mark you just made.,
Install anchors.,
Screw in your brackets.",How to Hang Curtains1," Decide if you want to open and close your drape by pulling a cord or if you want to manually pull the fabric itself to open and close your drapes.









A rod that uses a cord is called a traverse rod. The back side of a traverse rod has a series of small plastic carriers or decorative rings onto which the drapery panels are hung with the use of hooks or pins. The carriers or rings then slide open or closed as the cord is pulled. Pinch pleat drapes work well with traverse rods.

Decide if you want your drapes to open and stack on the left or on the right side of your window or evenly on each side. Choose a left pull, a right pull or a middle draw traverse rod accordingly.
Motorized traverse rods are a high-tech option that allow you to open and close your drapes with the flip of a switch.


A rod that requires you to open and close the drapes by hand is called a stationary rod. Tab top, back tab or grommet drapes work well with this style of rod. Since the tabs or grommets slide onto the rod, the panels can be pulled open or closed easily.

If you want to keep the drapes open and pulled away from the window, you can use tie-backs to hold them in place.
A spring tension rod is a special kind of stationary rod that adjusts to fit inside the window frame. The ends of the rod are covered in rubber to prevent it from scratching and damaging the frame. A tension rod is used for sheers or other light-weight fabric panels.
A cafe rod is another type of specialty rod. It's small in diameter and fairly plain in appearance. It's meant to hold lightweight drapes and is typically used in kitchens or bathrooms.


If you plan to layer your drapes, that is, hang sheers under your drapes or a valance over them or both, you may want to purchase a double- or triple-rod set. Another option is to purchase an additional rod for each layer.
Consider the style and design theme of your home when you purchase your drapery rods and pick something that will complement the look of your room.;
, Taking accurate measurements is key to success when hanging a curtain rod. Measure 3"" out and 4"" above your windows and mark the spots with a pencil.









If your rod is more than 5' long, mark a point 4"" above and at the center of the window where you may want to install a support bracket for extra stability.
If you want to give the illusion of higher ceilings, measure 1"" down from the ceiling for your top measurement. You may have to adjust this measurement a bit if your rods have large finials (decorative end pieces).

, As you measure, use a level and sturdy metal tape measure to ensure that your line is perfectly straight. If it's not, your curtains will hang unevenly.








, Using the hardware that came with your drapery rod, hold it in place at the pre-measured height and width and make small pencil marks to indicate where the screws will go.








, Make the hole tiny, just enough to get the screw started.









Don't start with a screw - it will likely damage the woodwork.
If you make the hole too big, it may be too wide for the screw and leave your rods loose.

, Purchase sheet rock anchors at your local hardware store and gently hammer them into the holes that you drilled for the bracket hardware. The anchors will help ensure that your rod stays firmly in place.








, Using the hardware that came with your rods, screw the brackets into the anchors installed on your wall. Make sure your screws go straight into the wall, not at an angle. .

Measure the window so that you know the drop and width you’ll need the blind to be.
Add 5cm to the width and drop for hems.

,


Right sides together and matching raw edges, take a 1 inch (2.5cm) seam and pin and sew the fabric and lining at the sides and at bottom.
Turn right side out and press with an iron.

, Measure 5cm from the top.


From this starting point, you will need to mark regular intervals across the blind - these will be the positions of the dowels.
These should be between 20cm and 30cm apart, finishing with a bottom section that is half the size of the rest. (For example, each interval is 20cm and the bottom interval is 10cm).
Mark these intervals with tailors’ chalk.

, Cut out strips of lining fabric 8cm wide by the width of the blind.


You will need one of these dowel pockets for each of the marked intervals.
Right sides together, fold in half along the length and, taking a .4 inch (1cm) seam, stitch the long, raw edge and one end.

, Turn through and press.


Pin and stitch the pockets centrally along the marked lines.
Sew through all fabric layers and keep the lines as unnoticeable as possible on the front of the blind.
Put a dowel into each pocket and slip stitch the ends, turning under the raw edges.

, Sew a blind ring to the end of each pocket 2cm from the edge of the fabric.


Sew additional blind rings at regular intervals of between 20cm and 40cm across the width.

, Secure the batten in position and stick on the hook strip of Velcro to the front.

, Turn 1 inch (2.5cm) at the top of the blind onto the wrong side. Pin and sew.


Pin and stitch the loop strip of Velcro across the top of the blind, and use to attach it to the batten.
Screw screw eyes into the underside of the batten to align with the rings on the blind, plus an extra screw eye to the side you want to pull the cords from.

, Fasten the cord to each bottom ring and thread upwards and onto the eyelets on the batten.


Take all the cords to the side you want to secure the blind through the extra eyelet.
Thread cords through blind acorn, knot and trim.

Roll the fabric around the wood.,
Make your loops.,
Pin the loops.,
Hang your shade.",How to Make a Roman Shade3," This way, you'll know exactly how much fabric you need.


Make sure to measure both wide and long. Though the shade will likely not cover the length of the entire window, you'll need to choose how much of the window will be covered.

This version of the Roman shade is immobile. Determine how much light you want let in before you begin working.



, It's best to use fabric scissors for this part.


Cut a section that's 2 inches (5 cm) wider than your window. This extra length is for the hem on each side.
Cut a section that's at least 2/3 longer than the length of the window you want covered. If you want 18 inches (46 cm) covered, allot 30 inches (76 cm) -- this accounts for the looping of the Roman shade style.

, Preventing fraying will increase the longevity of your work and ensure a more uniform look.


Each side should be 1 inch (2.54 cm) -- the extra material allotted from before.
Use iron-on, no-sew tape as an alternative to a needle and thread.

, 2 inches (5 cm) is a sturdy width.


The length of the wood should match the width of your shade.
If you don't have a saw (or prefer not to use one), most home improvement stores will cut it for you.

, This eliminates the need for a curtain rod.


Drill holes (left, right, center) matching the size of the screws you have.

, Raw wood will draw negative attention when seen from the sides. Use whatever medium you have available.


Spare pieces of fabric (secure with glue or colored duct tape)
Paint
Beads (secure with glue)

, Use colored duct tape or glue to make it nice and sturdy.


Where the wood meets the fabric will be facing the window, at the bottom. This part will not be visible.
Make sure your fabric is facing the right direction!

, Gather the fabric into pleats, looping and folding back. Each loop should hang lower than the one before. They can be as large or small as you desire. Around 5 inches (12.7 cm) apart is standard.


Place your shade on the floor. To keep it straight, you can refer to a rug or square tiles, if available.
Use a ruler if you're feeling meticulous. The loops on the left and right need to be the same size.

, Make sure to do this from the back of the shade, so the pins aren't visible.


Don't grab too much fabric from the front. This could pucker the fabric and draw attention to the pins.
Place three pins in each loop -- left, right, and center.
If your loops are different sizes or your pins are uneven, redo them before you get any further.
Pin the bottom of the shade. Any hanging material should be the last loop.

, Lift up the material and screw the wood into the wall, using your three pre-drilled holes.


The fabric should drape over the front, obscuring the screws and wood from view.
Make any small alterations once hung. If you are happy with the finished product, you may tack the material and remove the pins.

Tacking could produce puckering."

Determine the length.,
Determine the fullness.,
Put the drapes onto the rods.",How to Hang Curtains2," The length of your drapes can convey a casual or a more formal look, so be clear on what kind of atmosphere you want to create in your room so that your drapes can reflect that feeling.


For a casual look, measure the distance from the bottom of the drapery rod or drapery rings, to the floor and subtract ½"".
For a more formal look, choose a length that allows the drapes to sit or ""puddle"" on the floor. Measure the distance from the bottom of the drapery rod or drapery rings to the floor and add anywhere from 1"" to 10"".

A 1"" puddle (also called a “break“) will just touch the floor.
A 2""-4"" puddle will allow for just a slight spill of fabric.
A 5""-8"" puddle has enough extra length to allow the fabric to ""fan out"" onto the floor.
A 10"" puddle creates the most opulent look and works best with draperies made from heavy material such as velvet.
If you plan to open and close your drapes a lot, puddling is not a good idea since the bottoms will get dirty quickly from dragging on the floor.



, When deciding on fullness, stick to your aesthetic. If you've chosen to go with a casual look in length, use panels that cover your window with fewer folds. If you've chosen a formal look, use panels that are wider and will create lush folds.


Measure your window’s overall width. Multiply it by 1 for a casual look, 2 for a mid-range or standard look and 3 for a full or formal look.
To reduce gaps that can let in light and compromise privacy, add 2"" to 8"" so that the end panels can extend beyond the window frame.

For example, if you want a full look and your window is 45"" wide, you'll need roughly 135"" of drapery fabric (45""x3) plus a maximum of 8"" to cover any light gaps.



, The approach you take will depend on whether you've chose to go with a traverse rod or with a stationary rod.



Traverse rod - Place drapery hooks/pins into the openings next to each pleat on the back of the drapery panels. Insert the hooks into the carriers attached to your drapery rod. Begin at one end and insert the first hook in the top hole of the end bracket. Wrap the drape around the bracket at the end and place each subsequent hook into a carrier. Keep moving unused carriers towards the other end of the rod as you work. When the drapes completely cover the rod, insert the last hook into the top hole of the end bracket.

Stationary rod - Slide the rod through the pocket, tabs or grommets at the top of your drapery panels. Spread the panels out evenly across the rod and set the rod in place on the hardware you installed.

Balloon valances.,
Pinch pleat valances.,
Scarf valances.",How to Hang Curtains3," A balloon valance holds its shape because it has a rod pocket at the top and at the bottom. Once in place, you stuff tissue paper inside the valance to create a ""poofy"" effect.


Mount the brackets. Since a balloon valance is not only meant to cover a drape but also needs extra space for the tissue paper ""stuffing,"" use extra long (9"") brackets. Mount them at the same height and 1""-2"" outside the brackets for the drapes. Mount the brackets for the lower rod where you want the bottom of your valance to sit.
Hang the valance. Once the brackets are installed, slide the valance onto the rods through the top and the bottom pockets on the valance. Bunch it up evenly across the rods and then insert the rods into the brackets.
Create the balloon effect. Stuff the valance with tissue paper to create fullness. If hanging more than one balloon valance, make sure the look is uniform.

, These are essentially just small drapes; like pinch pleat drapes, they're distinguished by openings next to each pleat on the back side of the valance into which you'll insert hooks that will attach to your rod.


Hang the rod. Since your valance will cover your drape at the top, choose longer (6"") brackets to allow room for your drape underneath. Mount the brackets at the same height and 1""-2"" outside the brackets already in place for your drapes. Once brackets are in place, insert your rod.
Hang the valance. Place drapery hooks/pins into the openings alongside the pleats on the back of the valance. Insert the hooks into the carriers attached to your drapery rod. Begin at one end and insert the first hook in the top hole of the end bracket. Wrap the valance around the bracket at the end and place each subsequent hook into a carrier and keep moving unused carriers towards the other end of the rod. When the valance completely covers the rod, insert the last hook into the top hole of the end bracket.

, These are long pieces of fabric (usually 6') that frame a window and can be hung many different ways.


Install scarf holders. If you want your scarf valance to dip down in the middle of the window, you'll need two holders; if you want it to rise up, you'll need three. Measure 3"" on both sides of your casings and install your scarf holders there. If you're using three holders, measure 4"" above the exact center of the window casing and install the additional holder.
Hang the scarves. Thread the scarf through the holders to create the look you want. Make sure that the scarf length on one side of the window is even with the length on the other side.

"
"
Decide on the length of the curtain.,
Hang the curtain.",How to Hang Curtains4," The length of a balloon curtain can be adjusted up or down, but the length isn't meant to be changed frequently so it's best to decide on the length you want before installing.


Lay the curtain face down on the floor; you'll see horizontal rows of rings sewn on the back of the shade. Use the split rings that came with the shades and slip one into each of the rings along the bottom-most row of the curtain. Now, slip each split ring onto the ring in the row above it. Repeat this process row by row until you get your curtain the length you want.

, Slide the rod through the rod pocket at the top of the curtain and spread the fabric out evenly across the rod. Mount the rod on the brackets and puff out the curtain from behind to create fullness.

"
"
Decide if you'll use an inside or an outside mount.,
Install the brackets.,
Attach the shade.",How to Hang Curtains5," Roman shades can be placed within the frame of the window or can extend beyond depending on your preference. Where you mount your shades will determine the size of the shade you must buy.



Inside mount - Measure the distance between the edges of the inside window frames at the top, middle, and bottom and use the narrowest width. Then, measure the distance from the inside edge of the top window frame down to the top of the window to sill. If there is no sill, measure to the point where you want the shade to reach.

Outside mount - Measure the distance between the outermost points where the shade is to be placed. Be sure your measuring surface overlaps each side of window frame by at least 1 1/2"" and as much as 3"". Then, measure the distance from where top of shade will be located to top of sill or, if there's no sill, to the point where you want the shade to reach. Again, add 1 1/2"" to 3"" to this measurement.

, If you're mounting the shades inside the window frame, mount each bracket in the upper-most corners of the window frame. If you're using an outside mount, install the brackets to the wall above the window as per your measurements.


It's very important that your brackets are level so that the shade is even when you pull it up.

, Insert the front edge of the shade headrail onto the brackets and firmly press the back edge of the shades up into the mounting brackets until you hear them snap into place.

, Lay your fabric down and make sure it's smooth with no wrinkles. Put your pattern over top the fabric, and pin it down to keep it in place. Cut right along the edges of the pattern. You should have a perfect 16"" x 36"" rectangle of fabric.

, Make markings 10"" from the short ends of the fabric, on each side. If you don't have marking chalk, you can cut a small snip in the fabric to mark it.

, Thread your sewing machine, making sure the needle is sharp. Set up your iron and ironing board for pressing the hems.

, Measure and fold down 1/4"" along the short ends of the fabric, folding the wrong sides together. Press with iron, and repeat so that the raw edge is enclosed.

, Keep your stitches as close to the loose edges as possible. Repeat on both ends.

, Fold the hemmed edge of the fabric in toward the center until you reach the mark you made 10"" from the end. Make sure the fabric is folded with the right sides together. Repeat for the other side. The hems should overlap each other in the center. Pin the sides in place.

, If your sewing machine has a zig zag setting, zig-zag the raw edges to keep them from fraying.

, This sets the stitches into the fabric. Turn the pillow right side out and then press all around the edges.

, Or you can buy a 16"" x 16"" pillow form to place inside!

Assemble the items needed.,
Measure the flat seat of the bench - length and depth.,
Cut seven pieces of fabric.,
Measure out the first piece of fabric, adding a half an inch to each side for seam allowance.,
Calculate the size of the bottom pieces.,
Measure out two pieces of fabric -- one that is 14 inches by 16 inches, the other that is 27 inches by 16 inches.,
The sides of the sewn cushion cover will need to be 3 inches to accommodate the 3 inch upholstery foam.,
Measure two long strips of fabric 41 inches by 4 inches.,
Cut out all seven pieces of fabric, taking care to cut each side as straight as possible.,
Mark the fabric.,
Lay out the biggest piece of fabric right or ""good"" side up.,
Position your needle so the first stitch will enter the fabric at the dot or circle you've drawn half an inch in from the corner.,
Lay out the main fabric piece with the long strips sewn on, right or ""good"" side up.,
Sew the shorter strips to each side of the main piece, beginning and ending at your corner marks and avoiding the long fabric strips.,
Add a hem.,
With the main fabric piece again laid out right side up, with the strips sewn on and also laid out flat, pin the un-sewn or raw end of the larger back piece to one of the short end strips.,
Do the corners.,
Repeat for all four corners.

,
To complete the cushion cover, pin the loose ends of the larger back piece to the long end of the long side piece, again taking care to avoid any seam allowances.,
Sew from the corner mark right along the long edge and over the hemmed end of the back piece.,
Taking care not to cut into your stitching, clip each corner so the extra fabric won't bunch inside.

,
Turn your cushion cover right side out.,
Insert the upholstery foam by tucking one end of the foam under the larger piece on the back of your cover first, then putting the rest in under the smaller piece.",How to Sew Bench Cushions," These are listed below. You can buy upholstery foam in thicknesses of 2 inches, 3 inches, 4 inches, etc. In this tutorial, the 3-inch thick foam is used.

, Keep in mind that the cushion will sit inside any arms or supports, so don't measure beyond those.


In this example, the bench seat is 40 inches long by 15 inches deep.;
, The first piece will be for the top of the cushion, pieces two and three will be for the bottom of the cushion, and pieces four through seven will be for the sides.

, For a 40 inch by 15 inch bench, you will need to measure out a piece of fabric 41 inches by 16 inches.


The two pieces for the bottom or back of the cushion will overlap each other. This is called an ""envelope"" closure. It's like a pillow sham.

, Add 6 inches to the length of the cushion. For this project, your first piece of fabric is 41 inches in length, so adding six inches would give you 47 inches. Now you're going to measure two pieces that will overlap about 1/4 or 1/3 of the way along the back. The depth of the piece stays the same as for the first piece of fabric -- 16 inches.

, These will overlap on the back or bottom of the cushion cover, leaving an opening to insert the foam.

, Adding half an inch for seam allowance to each side comes to 4 inches.

, Measure two shorter strips of fabric 16 inches by 4 inches.

, Use a cutting mat and a rotary cutter if you have them. If not, good sewing scissors will do just fine.

, After cutting out all the fabric, take a ruler and a pen or pencil and mark the corner of each piece of fabric on the back with a dot or circle one half inch in from the corner. These marks are important as they will tell you where to start and stop sewing at each corner.

, Take one of the long fabric strips and place it face down along the top of the piece, making sure the corners meet and the edges are even. Pin it in place. Do the same with the other long strip along the bottom of the fabric piece.

, Keeping to a half-inch seam, sew the top fabric strip to the large piece of fabric, stopping at the mark near the corner. Cut the thread and move on to the bottom fabric strip, again beginning and ending at your corner marks. Press the seams toward the large fabric piece.

, Take the shorter fabric strips and pin them in place, again matching corners and keeping edges even. Make sure they're not pinned to the long fabric strips that are already sewn on.

, Press the seams toward the main fabric piece.

, Before sewing the back pieces on, you'll need to hem one end of each. Using an iron, press a half-inch fold at the short end of each piece. Then sew along the edge of each fold.

, Do the same with the smaller back piece and sew both in place, remembering to start and stop at your corner marks. You now have one very long piece of stitched-together fabric!

, Take the end of one of the short strips where it meets one of the long strips and pin them together, taking care to keep any seam allowance from being caught in the pins. Sew from one corner mark to the next.

,, Remember that these back pieces will overlap to form the envelope closure. It might be simpler to sew one piece on, then sew the other over it.

, Do both sides, top and bottom, then attach and sew the smaller back piece on.

,, Using your finger, the blunt end of a seam ripper, or the eraser end of a pencil, push each corner out as far as possible.

, And you are done -- you have a new bench cushion!

Pick out fabric.,
Cut the fabric to size.,
Fold the fabric in half.,
Stitch the long side and one short side.,
Hem the open side.,
Decorate the pillowcase.",How to Make Pillow Cases1," Pillow cases are often made from a fabric that feels comfortable against the skin, like soft cotton, satin, flannel or a jersey knit fabric. Pick out fabric that matches the color scheme in your bedroom, especially your bed covering and sheets. To make a set of standard pillow cases, you will need 2 yards (1.8 m) of fabric.









If you're going to sleep on the pillow cases, be sure to choose a washable fabric.
If you're making pillow cases that are more decorative in purpose, the fabric you choose doesn't have to be soft or quite as easily washable. Choose any type of fabric you'd like to complement the color scheme in your bedroom.;
, To make a standard pillowcase, use a scissors or a rotary cutter to cut out a piece that is 45"" x 36"". If you're using a patterned fabric, take care to cut it so that the pattern is straight.








, Fold it length-wise with the finished sides, or ""right"" sides, of the fabric together. The unfinished sides, or ""wrong"" sides, should be facing out.








, Use a sewing machine or a threaded needle to make a straight stitch up the long side of the fabric. Turn the fabric and continue stitching one of the sort sides. When you're finished, turn the fabric right side out.









Use a thread that matches your fabric or a contrasting thread to add a little flair.
If you're stitching by hand, take your time and make sure your seam is completely straight. You can pin the fabric with straight pins to help guide your stitching if necessary.

, Start by folding the fabric back to create a 1/2-inch hem. Iron the fabric to create a crease. Fold the fabric back again, this time creating a 3-inch hem. Iron the fabric again and use your sewing machine or a needle and thread to stitch around the base of the hem to keep it in place.








, You can add ribbon, decorative lace, or other decorations to the finished pillowcase. Consider sewing a colorful contrasting ribbon over the hemline to hide the stitch there.

Draw the circular shape of the pillow onto the fabric.,
Cut around the lines.,
Place the two fabric circles together evenly.,
Stuff with appropriate fiber stuffing.,
Sew up the hole.",How to Sew a Round Pillow," If you are a beginner, it is best to start with a fabric that is easy to sew. Select a fabric that matches the couch, bed, etc.;
, Make the pillow on the large side, so that you can sew it more easily.

, Use a fabric marker, pen, chalk etc. It is always helpful to use a cardboard template to draw around - mistakes are more easily remedied on the cardboard than on the fabric when creating the circle.

, It is easier to place two pieces of fabric together when cutting, as you will get a perfect matching cut.

, Before you start sewing, it might be easier to draw a dotted chalk line around. Sew. Hand sewing is often easier for this simple project. Do not complete the stitching all the way around – leave a hole for stuffing the pillow.

, Make sure that the pillow is fully stuffed so that it sits firmly.

, Pat down the pillow into shape. Add any adornments that you think will improve it (for example, lace, buttons, fabric shapes, etc.) Once completed, use as wished.

First, you are going to want something soft.,
Measure out the size of fabric.,
Lay the two pieces of fabric so that the color/design/patterns are facing the outside(like how you imagine the pillow to look like).,
Tie double-knots with the bottom & top sections of each strip so that you end up with a fringe around the pillow.,
Stuff the pillow with stuffing, or scrap pieces of fabric.",How to Make Your Own Throw Pillows," It's no fun when you go to someone's house, and all they have is really hard pillows, but they look super-cute... yeah, it takes away the cuteness. Go to a fabric store, or collect some old (but not too old) shirts, blankets, bags, or anything that's soft and stylish.;
, Usually 1 and a half feet is really good(make sure it's even on all four sides). Note that the size you cut, will not be the size of the finished product (it will be smaller).

, Cut slits 6 inches (15.2 cm) into both fabric pieces (towards the middle) about one inch apart, all the way around.

, Please DO NOT DO THIS ALL THE WAY AROUND YET! Leave one side un-tied.

, Continue tying the fringe until you reach the place where you started. You now have your throw pillow!

Find a flat bed sheet with a wide top hem.,
Wash, dry, and iron the sheets to get rid of any shrinking, wrinkles, and fold lines.Be sure to wash the sheets according to the directions on the package or tag.,
Cut the sheet in half lengthwise, if needed.,
Consider hemming the cut edges for a cleaner finish.Most sheets won't fray after you cut them, but you will get a nicer finish if you hem it.,
Using a seam ripper, open both ends of the top hem on each side of the sheet.,
Tuck the ripped seams inside the hem for a cleaner finish.,
Pass the curtain rod through the hems and hang your instant curtains.,
Place the curtains to either side of the window.,
Use matching ribbons as tiebacks.",How to Make No Sew Curtains1," Depending on what look you want, you will need one twin-sized sheet, two twin-sized sheets, or one full-sized sheet. A twin-sized sheet will measure 66 by 96 inches (167.64 by 243.84 centimeters). A full-sized sheet will measure 81 by 96 inches (205.74 by 243.84 centimeters). Listed below are some options to get you started:Get two twin-sized sheets (one per panel) if you want very full curtains.
Cut a twin-sized sheet in half to make two panels, if you want skinny curtains.
Cut a full-sized sheet in half to make two panels if you want standard curtains.;
, If you lost the package and can't find the tag, use a cool wash cycle, and a normal dry cycle. Iron the sheets once they are dry.

, If you want to turn one bed sheet into two thinner panels, fold the sheet in half and line up the edges. Press the fold with an iron, then cut along the fold.

, Fold both raw edges inward, towards the wrong side of the fabric, twice by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press the fold flat with an iron, then insert some iron-on hem tape inside the hem. Following the instructions on the package, press the hem flat again to seal it.


Because of the length you are working with, you might find it easier to insert and iron 10 inch (25.4 centimeters) long sections of iron-on hem tape at a time.When you are done, flip the curtain over so that the right side is facing you, and press the hems flat for 3 to 5 seconds. This helps seal the iron-on hem tape further., This will create the holes through which the curtain rod will slide––do not unpick any other part of the hem's seam, just the sides.


Consider leaving the top hem alone, and using clip-on curtain rings to hang the sheets onto the curtain rod instead.

, Press flat with an iron, but do not use any iron-on hem tape.

, If you decided to use curtain rings, simply clip them onto the top hem, and pass the curtain rod through the rings.

, If you have a very high ceiling, hang the curtains higher up, and pull them to the outer edges of the window (as opposed to the inner edges).

, To prevent fraying of the ribbons, cut each end diagonally.

Reaching through the opening, pull the inside of your project out so it's right-side-out.

,
Stuff the pillow.

,
Sew up the opening using a fell stitch and thread that's about the same color as the fabric.",How to Sew a Horseshoe Shaped Pillow," The items needed can be found at quality craft stores or craft sections of large variety stores.;
,, You'll also need to add 1/4"" to only one bottom end of the horseshoe. You'll need this a bit later on.


For example, if you wanted a 10"" x 10"" x 5"" pillow, then draw a horseshoe that is 15 1/4"" x 15 1/4"". You need the extra quarter-inch for the seam allowance, and the extra 5 inches (12.7 cm) for the width.
If you can't draw the horseshoe shape right, try printing a template off your computer and using that.

,, Don't do any sharp turns except for the parts where it's a right angle.

,,,, Try to make small, but taut stitches. When you reach the end, do a double knot or a knot big enough to stop the thread from coming out.

Add the buttons.,
Fit the stuffing in.,
Finished.

",How to Make Your Own Cushion Cover," Measure the length and width of the cushion stuffing and cut the front and back of the cushion to size. To do this, use a chalk and mark the size before cutting it. Remember to leave some extra bits so it can be sewed together.;
, Then pin the covers together and place it under the presser foot of the machine. Lower the presser foot and begin sewing. Do this for all the sides- except for one side where you will sew the buttons later on. After sewing it, cut off all the extra bits with pinking shears to prevent fraying edges.

, Using chalk, lightly draw the design on the front of your cushion. Ensure that before doing this; make sure that you have planned it out on paper first so that you don’t stuff it up in the process of completing it.

, After planning, sew on the bits and pieces you have chosen to use. This is done by hand sewing. For my cushion, I had little flower-like gold motifs as well as small orange heart-shaped motifs. My material was checkered, which was helpful in the layout of my motifs.

, This, also, is done by hand sewing. This part applies for my cushion because I also chose to bead my cushion cover. This is not compulsory, but it was part of my design. I used gold beads and beaded a diamond-shaped pattern linking some of my motifs in the process.

, The buttons that would be easier to use are the little clip ones (they fit into each other to fasten). To make the job easier, you may want to use chalk to mark the places where you want to put the buttons. This will ensure that they will fit into each other properly. Sew the buttons on by hand.

, Usually stuffing comes with a lining already made. Sometimes, however, they come without a lining and it is preferable to make a lining so that when you put it in the cushion cover, it does not appear lumpy. You do this in the same way as the actual cushion cover- but you can use scrap material as long as it is the right size. If the lining is already there, just insert it into the cushion cover, fasten the buttons and there you have it - your own hand-made cushion.

",How to Make Pillow Cases2," For this method you need three different fabrics in coordinating colors. Choose one fabric to make up the main section of the pillowcase, a second fabric for the hem around the opening, and a third accent fabric.









Pick three solid colored-fabrics or go for three different patterns with like colors. The fabrics don't have to ""match,"" exactly, but it helps if they each share one or two colors.
Try a festive pillowcase with fabrics in holiday colors or patterns. Holiday pillow cases make excellent gifts.

, Use a scissors or rotary cutter to carefully cut each piece of fabric to the right size. To make a standard pillowcase, cut the main piece of fabric to 26"" x 44"". Cut the second piece of fabric to 12"" x 44"". Cut the last piece of fabric for the trim to 2"" x 44"".








, To prepare the fabric to be sewn, use an iron to remove the wrinkles. Iron the large piece and the medium piece flat. Fold the trim in half lengthwise with wrong sides together and iron it flat.








, Place the medium piece of fabric right side up on your work surface. Line up the trim fabric with the edge of the medium fabric, so that the raw edges are on the outside and the folded edge is on the inside. Finally, lay the large piece of fabric over the medium and trim fabrics, right side down.









Make sure all of the layers of fabric are perfectly aligned along the top edge.
Add a few straight pins along the edge of the fabric layers to hold them in place.

, Use your fingers to begin rolling the top layer of fabric, which is the largest piece, toward the pinned edge. Continue rolling to within a few inches of the pinned edge. Now take the medium piece of fabric and fold it over the roll, aligning it with the pinned edge. Use more straight pins to pin all of the layers in place.








, Use your sewing machine or a threaded needle to make a straight stitch along the pinned edge of the fabric. The stitch should be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the edge of the fabric. Remove the pins from the fabric as you stitch.









Make sure the stitch catches all of the layers of fabric.
Take care to make the stitch as straight and neat as possible. If you need to start over, use a seam ripper to remove the stitch, realign the fabric edges, and start again.

, Pull back the medium piece of fabric to reveal the large fabric roll underneath. Gently tug on the roll and reverse the fabric, then straighten it out on your work surface. Iron the pillowcase so that all the components lay completely flat.








, Reverse the pillowcase so that the wrong sides are facing out. Use your sewing machine or a needle and thread to stitch a straight seam around the remaining raw edges of the pillowcase. Leave the hemmed part of the pillowcase open.








, Lay it flat and iron it once more before placing it over a pillow.

, Some fabric types cannot be washed, so read the side of the bolt when buying your fabric; it will tell you how to wash the fabric.

, You will need this extra fabric for the seam allowances.

, Make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the fabric. For extra support, insert some iron-on hem tape inside the hem before you iron it.

, Insert a strip of iron-on hem tape before you press the hem down, then follow the instructions on the package when ironing it. Make sure that the top edge of the tape aligns with the folded edge of the hem.Folding the hem twice like this gives you a cleaner finish, and you won't have to worry about any fraying edges showing.


You might find it easier to insert and iron 10 inch (25.4 centimeters) long sections of iron-on hem tape at a time.

, Once again, make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the fabric. Insert a piece of iron-on hem tape inside the second set of hems you are folding. For extra support, you can insert some iron-on hem tape inside the first set of hems as well.

, Once again, make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the fabric. For extra support, insert some iron-on hem tape inside the hem before you press it with an iron.

, Insert a strip of iron-on hem tape before you press the hem down. Make sure that the top edge of the tape aligns with the top, folded edge of the hem., This will help fuse the iron-on hem tape inside the hems further.

, This is the easiest and simplest way of hanging curtains.

, Flip the curtain so that the back is facing you. Cut 3½ inch (8.89 centimeters) long strips of 2 inch (5.08 centimeters) wide ribbon. Space the ribbons 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) apart. Glue the top of each ribbon strip to the top of the curtain. Glue the bottom of each ribbon 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) from the top of the curtain, creating a bulge. Slide the panels onto the curtain rod.Choose a ribbon color that matches your curtain color.

, Take the curtain rod off the wall, and attach the curtains. When you are done, place the rod back onto the wall. Position the panels to either side of the window, and tie them back with pieces of matching ribbon, if desired. If you have a very high ceiling, you may want to hang the curtains higher up, and pull them to the outer edges of the window (as opposed to the inner edges) instead.


If you are using curtain rings, clip them onto the top hem, and pass the curtain rod through the rings.
If you are using ribbon tabs, pass the curtain rod through the tabs.
If you are using just the hem, pass the curtain rod through the wide, top hem.

, You can position the overlap right in the middle of your pillowcase, or you can offset it to the left or to the right. When you are done, the pillowcase should be the same width as your cushion.

, Use a matching thread color and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.To prevent the thread from unraveling, sew back and forth a few times across the start and end of your sewing. Remove the pins as you sew.

, You can now tuck the cushion into the pillowcase.

, Put the pillow wherever you want it.

, Measure your cushion, then add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to the length and width.Cut out a piece of fabric according to that measurement. For example, if your pillow was 16 by 16 inches (40.64 by 40.64 centimeters), then your front piece will be 16½ by 16½ inches (41.91 by 41.91 centimeters).

Use a ruler to measure the length of fabric to cut. Draw the dimensions on the fabric with a colored pencil, holding the pencil against the ruler to achieve a straight line.
Cut along the colored lines with scissors.

,


Divide the dimensions of the pillow by 3. A 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow will give you a measurement of 4 inches (10.2 cm).
Add 2 inches (5 cm) to that number. For the 12-inch pillow, the size of the small panel is 6 inches (15.2 cm).

,


Divide the dimensions of the pillow by 3. If you start with a pillow measuring 12 inches by 12 inches (30.5 cm by 30.5 cm), your result will be 4 inches by 4 inches (10.2 cm by 10.2 cm).
Multiply the new number by 2. For the 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow, the dimensions are now 8 inches by 8 inches (20.4 cm by 20.4 cm).
Add 2 inches (5 cm) to the total. For the original 12-inch (30.5-cm) pillow, you now have a large panel of 10 inches (25.4 cm).

You will need about 1 yard (0.92 meters) of fleece for each color/pattern.

, This is very important. You won't be turning your pillow inside out, so the right sides need to be on the outside from the very beginning.

, If you already have a pillow that you would like to use, put it down onto the fleece, and trace around it using a piece of chalk. If you don't have a pillow, simply draw a large circle or heart onto the fleece.

, The larger your shape/pillow are, the longer your tassels should be.

Purchase fabric for your cushion cover.,
Wash your fabric if it is made of a natural fiber like cotton.,
Iron the fabric.,
Cut your fabric to size.,
Sew both short ends of the fabric.,
Sew the long sides of your cushion cover.,
Turn your cushion cover right-side out.,
Insert your cushion into your new cushion cover.",How to Make a Cushion Cover1," Pick one that is pretty thick and durable, like an upholstery fabric. Cushions can take a lot of physical abuse, so making a cushion out of delicate fabric might look good at first but it will not last very long.


The amount of fabric you buy will depend on the size cushion you are making. Measure your cushion insert (or decide on a size of insert if you do not have one already). You will need 2 1/2 times the length of the cushion insert, as the fabric will be covering both sides of the cushion with a little overlap. Your fabric should also be a few inches wider than the width of the cushion insert, as you will need a bit extra for seam allowance.;
, When you get your fabric home, be sure to wash the fabric in a hot cycle before making your cushion cover. This will shrink the fabric, assuring that it will not shrink any further if you wash it after the cushion cover is made., Get is nice and smooth, as it will probably be quite wrinkled after it was washed and dried. Be sure to use the appropriate heat setting on your iron for the fabric you are using.

, To make sure that you cut your lines straight, use a straight edge to mark your lines before cutting them. The length of your fabric should measure 2 1/2 times the length of the cushion insert. The width of your fabric should measure the width of your cushion plus two inches.The extra two inches will give you enough extra fabric for seam allowance and the fluff of your insert.


If your insert is very fluffy you may need to add a few more inches to the width. If you are unsure of what width you should cut, put your insert on top of the fabric. Make sure the width of the fabric will fit up to the center of the sides of the insert plus a few inches for seam allowance.
Your piece of fabric should end up being shaped like a long rectangle, with two long edges and two short edges.

, Place your fabric on a table with the wrong side facing up and one of the short edges closest to you. Fold the short edge closest to you up a half inch and then fold it over once again. This will make the raw edge of your fabric concealed. Pin and then sew along the inside of the folded edge.


Repeat this on the other short end of your fabric.

, Place the fabric on a table with the right side facing up and one of the shorter edges closest to you. Fold the bottom of the fabric up 3/4 of the height of your cushion insert. Then fold the top of the fabric down, also 3/4 of the height of the cushion insert. This will make the ends overlap and the total height should be equal to the height of your cushion.


Once you hold the fabric you should have the wrong side facing out.
Pin along these two edges, through both layers, and sew along the seam.

, To push the corners fully right-side out you may need to stick your fingers or a chopstick inside the cushion cover once it is turned right-side out., You will need to squeeze it inside between the overlapping flaps on the back of the cover. Work it into place, putting your hands inside if need be to get the corners positioned correctly.


Iron your cushion cover before putting in the cushion if it has become wrinkled.

Fold the bottom edge of the t-shirt fabric up and to the inside of the cushion.,
Sew up the bottom edge of your pillow.,
Decorate your cushion!",How to Make a Cushion Cover2," Instead of throwing it away, make it into a cushion cover that you can enjoy every day.

, Lay the t-shirt out flat and then carefully make a cut from the armpits up to the top of the sleeve, following the line of the side of the shirt up to the top. Then make a cut across the top of the shirt, from the top of one sleeve, across the neck, to the top of the other sleeve.


Discard the arms and neck area you cut off. The piece of the t-shirt you keep will be shaped like a rectangle.

, Be sure that the space between the two side seams is the same width as your cushion.

,


If you prefer, you can stuff your t-shirt cushion cover with cotton wool, wool, or thin sheets of cotton, instead of a pre-made cushion.

, The goal here is to adjust the length of the t-shirt so that it is just long enough to cover up the bottom edge of the cushion.


Pin the bottom edge of the front and back of the t-shirt together. This will form the bottom seam of the cushion cover.

, Use a whipstitch or slip stitch to close up the seam.


You can use your sewing machine to sew the seam as close to the bottom edge as possible, but it could make a slightly awkward edge if you are not experienced at sewing.

, You can be as creative as you like. Sew buttons, beads, or little threads of yarn to the top. As long as you like it, it is perfect.


Another decoration idea for the more patient or experienced sewer is to embroider a small picture onto the front. This will make a nice centerpiece on your cushion cover.

If your sweater is fraying too much, serge the edges, or finish them off with a zigzag stitch.

, If the sweater is very bulky, you may have to clip the seams on the corners first. This will help reduce the bulk., There are two ways you can do this. You can simply tuck the bottom hem into the pillow case, and sew it shut by hand with a ladder stitch. You can also fold the hem over, and sew it shut with buttons. Here is how to do it:Pin the hem shut, as close to the pillow as you can.
Turn the pillow over, and sew wooden buttons to the back of the hem.
Turn the pillow over again, and fold the hem over onto the front of the pillow so that you can see the buttons.
Sew or glue the hem down to keep it in place.

Wooden buttons will lend the sweater pillow a nice, rustic charm.

Keep the sweater buttoned shut.
Choose a sweater with an interesting texture, such as a cable knit.

, Center the pillow form as best you can. If the sweater has a ribbed hem, position the pillow form just above it. If the sweater doesn't have a ribbed hem, place it at least ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the bottom edge; you will need this for the seam allowance.

The size of your pillow form depends on the size of your sweater. Use a pillow that is a few inches/centimeters smaller than your sweater so that it can fit inside.

, Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw around all four sides of the pillow form. Cut the sweater, leaving behind a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.

If the sweater is very thick, cut the front out first, then use the square/rectangle as a template to cut out the back.
Make sure that the sweater is big enough to wrap around the pillow. This is important, especially if the sweater is tightly-knit or if the pillow is bulky.

, Pin the sweater along the edges, then sew it using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. When you are done, cut the bottom hem down to ½-inch (1.27-centimeter)., Slip your fingers into the openings between the buttons, and unbutton the sweater. You do not have to unbutton it all the way. Once you have a big enough opening, turn the pillowcase inside out.If your sweater is very bulky, you may have to clip the corners at the seams.

, On the other hand, if you leave it as is, you can take the pillow form out and wash the cover whenever necessary."

Make sure that the fabric is big enough to wrap around your pillow form.
Choose a pillow form that is a few inches/centimeters smaller than your sweater. This will ensure that you have enough material to cover it.

, You can use any type of sweater you want, but one with a cable or rib pattern would look more interesting. Cut the sweater straight along the top, just below the armpits, and up the side seams. Separate the front and back panel.

If your sweater has a ribbed hem, cut it off.

, Do not cut the sweater panels down to fit the fabric squares just yet. You will do that towards the end.This is because the sweater fabric may stretch past the fabric squares.

Do not pin the front and back sweater panels together just yet.

, Once again, do not sew the front and back sweater panels together just yet. Simply sew the fabric squares to the back of each panel, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) away from the edge of the fabric square., If you want to, you can serge the edges, or stitch around them using a zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. This will keep the edges from unraveling., Pin the two panels together, with the sweater sides facing inward and the fabric sides facing outward.

Fold the fabric in half, right-side facing in.,
Stitch a row of long stitches around each circle.,
Clip this edge of each circle of the bolster pillow, .5 inches (1.27 cm) apart, all the way around.,
Find the circumference of the 2 circles by measuring the diameter.",How to Make a Bolster Pillow1," Set the paint can on top of the fabric, near the bottom edge. Trace around the paint can with the fabric marker.


Cut 2 pieces of fabric around the traced line. This will give you 2 circles for the ends of the decorative pillow.





;
, It should be .5 inches (1.27 cm) away from the edge. This is the seam that will connect the tube to the ends.

,


Clip up to the stitched line, but not through it. The clipped edges will make it easier for you to sew the pillow together in the end.

, You can do this by multiplying the diameter of the circle by 3.14 for the circumference. You need this measurement to find out how much fabric to cut for the middle of the bolster pillow.


For example, if the diameter of the circles is 5 inches (12.7 cm), the circumference is 15.7 inches (39.9 cm), or 5 x 3.14.

, Pin the 24-inch (60 cm) edge together.


Sew the pillow along this 24-inch (60 cm) edge, .5"" (1.27 cm) from each edge, forming a tube.







, The inside should be facing out as you're pinning.

, This is so that it fits inside the rounded edge of the rectangle. If you don't, you'll have excess fabric on the edges of your pillow.

, Use the row of long stitches on the fabric as a guide as you sew the pillow, so that they will be concealed when the decorative pillow is finished.


Repeat with the second circle if you are using the polyester batting.






Don't sew the second side all up! Leave a 3-inch (7.62 cm) gap so you can add the batting to the bolster pillow.

Purchase a firm pillow.,
Tie it two-thirds down from one end.,
Place it on the bed vertically instead of horizontally.",How to Make a CPAP Pillow1," You can buy an inexpensive firm pillow from your local department or home goods store. If you don’t want to purchase a new pillow, you can just use an old one you already own.A firm pillow will work best, since it’ll hold its shape better than a plush one.;
, Grab an old dress tie and use it to tie off the pillow to create indentations for the CPAP mask. Tie the pillow tightly two-thirds from one end.A dress tie is more durable and will feel better to lie on than string, twine, or rope. If you don't have a dress tie, try using a soft ribbon or narrow strip of fabric.

, You’d normally place a pillow on the bed horizontally, or so the longer sides face the head and foot of the bed. Instead, place the pillow vertically, so the shorter sides face the bed’s head and foot. The end of the pillow with the tie one-third down from its edge should face the foot of the bed.Try lying down on your side on the one-third section of the pillow. The tie should create spaces that comfortably fit your CPAP mask. If necessary, adjust the tie’s location to find the most comfortable position.

Carefully stuff cotton into the hole.,
Sew up the open edge.",How to Hand Sew a Small Pillow," Make sure it is at least two feet wide and long.;
, Now fold it in half so that the side you want is in the inside of the fold. Measure out a foot square (the photo shows a pillow this size), but you can change the size if wished. Cut it out, keeping the cloth folded.

, Beginning on one of the two corners right next to the fold, begin to sew up the edge perpendicular to it. Be careful to create small stitches close to the edge, but not so close it runs off the bottom piece of cloth. Continue, re-threading the needle as necessary, along two sides. You should now have one side folded, two sides sewn shut, and one open edge.

,, You do not want your pillow to be limp, but don't overstuff it and be gentle so you don't rip any stitches. Once the whole pillow, including the corners, is stuffed, thread the needle again (if necessary).

, With this side, you need to be particularly careful because this edge will not be concealed like the rest. Once you are done stitching, go over the last few stitches a few times to make sure it is totally closed, snip the thread off, tie a tight knot, and snip off any excess around the knot. Plump your new pillow.

Sew a pillowcase onto it if you desire.",How to Make a CPAP Pillow2," Purchase an inexpensive foam pillow. Lie on each side with your mask on, and measure where the mask makes contact with both sides of the pillow.Trace out the areas that you’ll need to cut out to make room for the mask. Be careful not to accidentally mark your mask.

, Use a long serrated knife or electric carving knife to cut the pillow. Carve along the marks you traced on each side.Carving cutouts for the mask on each side will allow you to comfortably sleep on both your right and left sides.
If necessary, cut a space at the bottom of the pillow for your shoulder., If you’d like, you can sew a case onto the pillow by stitching along the contours. If not, you can just cover it with a standard pillowcase. Make sure the pillowcase is large enough to fit into the contours without obstructing them.If the pillowcase fits too tightly, it won’t take the same shape as the contours you cut into the pillow.

, Trace a pillow shape with two cutouts on each side onto a piece of tissue paper. It should look like a rectangle with two C-shaped cutouts for the CPAP mask on each side. Using the tissue paper form as a guide, cut the fabric with shears to create the pillow’s front and back sides., Place the front and back sides together right side in, or so what will eventually be the insides of the pillow face out. The pieces of fabric should be on top of each other so that they’re inside out when you stitch them together. Use straight pins to secure the pieces of fabric to each other so you’ll be able to sew them together., As you stitch three sides of the pillow, take care to follow the curves of the C-shaped contours. Before stitching, tie a knot at the end of your thread opposite the needle so it won’t pull through the fabric.If you’re using a sewing machine, try not to yank the fabric too hard to follow the curve. Focus on the area just ahead of your stitching needle and gently move the fabric with your fingertips to follow the curve.
Leave the fourth side open so you can flip the pillow right side out and stuff it., After stitching three sides and turning the pillow right side out, you can stuff the pillow. You can find a foam, cotton, or polyester filling of your choice at your local craft or home goods store. Pull the filling apart to loosen it, then pack it into the pillow’s nooks and crannies., You can pin the fourth side before stitching it closed to test its firmness. Add or remove filling to fit your comfort standards and accommodate your CPAP mask. Once you’ve filled the pillow to your liking, stitch the last side closed. "

Place the straight edge of a big petal flush with the edge of this circle.,
Continue sewing on the large petals, right around the circle edge.,
Finish up sewing on the petals.",How to Make a Small Pillow Decorated with Rose Petals3," To prepare the 19 x 19cm panel, draw a circle around it using a compass as a guide. Leave a decent amount of edge space between this circle and the edge of the fabric.

, Pin in place then sew along the straight edge to attach it to the fabric.

, Once you reach the end of this circle, it's time to start layering the petals all the way into the center of the pillow panel.


Sew the second layer of the petals. Place the straight edge of the petal just below the straight edge of the petals already sewn on, aligning the petal so that it sits over the junction or meeting point of two petals already sewn in place (see image).
Repeat this all the way around the second circle. Keep using the large petals for now.
Continue to add more layers of petals each time you reach the end of a circle. Eventually you'll need to swap to the smaller petals, to give the impression of decreasing petal size.

, As you reach the center of the felt rose, you'll need to place fewer and fewer petals, as the space becomes tighter. Just be sure to keep aligning the petals neatly and to cover any gaps so that no fabric shows through.


At the very end, sew two petals at the heart or center of the rose.

If repurposing an old pillow, clean it well to remove marks.;
, For the sake of this tutorial, the assumption is that the pillow you're using is square. Any other shape and you'll need to make adjustments as befits the shape.

,, Pin this carefully to the pillow front, the tip going down to the base and the two top edges meeting the top edges of the pillow. The pins must create a very tight line down the edges of the triangle, to ensure exact lines when painting the fabric paint in place.

, Pour into a container for ease of access and have your brush ready.

, This creates the neat barrier lines between the tuxedo coat and the white shirt that will be underneath it. It might help to follow a ruler for exactness.

, This will be the two triangle shapes to each side of the paper triangle. Allow to dry completely before removing the template.

, You should have a cushion with two black triangle sides and a big white triangle center.

, You'll need two evenly shaped triangles for this. The measurements for the bow tie should be determined by the amount of white space at the top of the pillow, and the space to the edges from the black triangles. The triangles will be placed tip to tip, with the wide base facing each black triangle. There should be a small, clearly noticeable space between the base edges and the edges of the black triangles. This represents the end of the bow tie and the continuance of the white shirt before reaching the black coat.


When creating the cardboard template, make it slightly larger than the intended final size, then cut out most of the inner part of the triangle while leaving a strong edge to serve as the paint infill template.

, Be sure that the tips meet evenly and that the bow tie looks straight.

, Be especially careful around the edges, to ensure that they're neat. Allow to dry completely before removing the template. Make any touch-ups as needed.

Fill your bags.",How to Make a Bean Bag Chair," To make a bean bag chair, you will need to create two bags: an inner bag that will hold the “beans,” and an exterior cover to go over it. Since the inner bag will be out of sight, go with something simple and affordable, like white cotton quilting fabric. Save your money for the cover’s material.You can alter the dimensions as you wish, but these instructions are for a bag 28 inches (0.71 m) high with a 50-inch (1.27 m) diameter.
For this size, each length of fabric needs to be 6 yards (5.49 m) long and 60 inches (1.54 m) wide.;
, Buy an equal length and width of fabric for the chair’s exterior. Since this will be on the outside, pick whatever fabric pleases you most. Consider both its visual appeal and how it feels to the touch. This could be anything from:Corduroy
Denim
Flannel
Fleece
Velour

, For durability, go with expanding foam. However, be aware that expanding foam is vacuum-sealed when packaged, so expect it to expand very quickly as soon as you open the package. This means you have to work just as quickly once it’s time to fit it into your inner bag. If you think you will have some difficulty with this, consider an alternate material.For this size chair, you will need a 30 lb (13.6 kg) package of foam measuring 36” x 36” x 48” (0.91 x 0.91 x 1.22 m).
As an alternate material, you could also use packing peanuts. Just be sure they are the type that won’t dissolve when exposed to water, just in case you spill anything over your bean bag chair., You will be making identical cuts from each, so start with either fabric. The first thing you will be cutting out is a circle with a circumference of 170 inches (4.32 m), so unroll a little more than 54 inches (1.37 m), which is the diameter. Spread the fabric nice and flat on your worktable.In case you need a refresher, the circumference of a circle is the total distance around its edge.
The diameter is the distance of a straight line drawn from one side, through the center, to the opposite side.
The radius is the distance of a straight from the center to one side.

, Start by stretching a measuring tape out to 54 inches (1.37 m). Measure the fabric lengthwise down its middle and make a mark at least 27 inches (0.69 m) from its free end. Then measure the fabric’s width along this mark to double-check that you still have 27 inches of fabric on either side of it.If you don’t, simply make a second mark that is even with the first and at least 27 inches from either side.
Use a fabric pencil or chalk to make your marks and outlines, since these will wash away when you’re all done.

, Ask a partner to help you with this. First, cut a length of string roughly 40 inches (1 m) long. Tie one end to your fabric pencil or chalk. Now use your measuring tape to measure 27 inches (0.69 m) along the string. Carefully tie the other end to a straight pin, capped pen, or similar object, so that the string is exactly 27 inches long when pulled tight. Then:

Have your partner place the point of their pen, pin, or whatever in the center mark of your circle.
Pull the string tight between the two of you so that your chalk or fabric pencil is exactly 27 inches away from their pen or pin.
Have your partner keep their pen or pin perfectly still and straight as you circle the table, tracing a perfect circle over your fabric as you go.
Be sure to keep the string pulled tight between the two of you until you complete your circuit.
Also make sure that both of you keep your tools perfectly vertical, not at an angle, as you pull the string tight between them.

, Once you have drawn your first outline, use fabric scissors to cut the circle out. After that, unroll another 54 inches (1.37 m) or so from the same fabric. Create a second outline of equal size and cut that out. Then do the same with your other fabric.Once you’re done, you should have two identical circles cut from each fabric, all of the same size, for a total of four circles.

, Unroll at least 87 inches (2.21 m) of either fabric. Use your measuring tape and chalk or fabric pencil to mark an outline that is 87 inches long by 32 inches (0.81 m) wide. Then use your fabric scissors to cut this shape out of your fabric. Once you have, repeat the process once more with the same fabric.Once you have two equal rectangles from one fabric, do the same with the other, for a total of four rectangles of equal size, with two of each of fabric.

, Take your four rectangles and pair them off by fabric. With each pair, lay one rectangle on top of the other, with the right sides facing each other. Line the edges up perfectly. Then use a sewing machine to sew them together along one of the shorter ends to create one long rectangle of the same fabric.Once you’re done, each rectangle should measure 170 inches (4.32 m) long by 32 inches (0.81 m) wide.
In sewing, the “right side” refers to the “pretty” side: the one that’s meant to be on display on the outside of whatever you’re sewing.

, Again, pair your pieces together according to fabric. For each type, take a circle of the same fabric as your rectangle and pin its edges along one of the rectangle’s long sides, keeping their right sides together. Then sew the two together with a seam allowance between a quarter- and half-inch (0.64 and 1.27 cm). Once you have sewn the entire circle along the rectangle’s long side, finish by sewing the rectangle’s two short ends together.The seam allowance refers to the distance between the edge of the fabric and the seam that you are sewing.
The heavier the fabric, the larger your seam allowance should be.
When sewing, remove each pin as you come to it.

, For each fabric, the first circle that you sewed all the way around your rectangle is now the top of that bag. Now move on to its bottom. With each bag, take the second circle of the same fabric and pin the edges along the rectangle’s long side, as you did with the top circle. This time, however, stop short of pinning all the way around. Leave enough room for your zipper.The zipper isn’t strictly necessary for the inner bag.
If you’d rather do without one, simply sew the bottom circle to the rectangle as you did with the top.
Only this time, leave an open gap roughly 24 to 36 inches (0.61 to 0.91 m) long.
Later, once you are done stuffing the filler inside the bag through that gap, sew it shut.
That said, if you are using expanding foam, a zipper is strongly advised. This way you don’t have to sew the gap shut as the foam expands inside the bag.

, For each bag, use one that is at least 48 inches (1.22 m) long.Zip it all the way shut, then unzip it about a finger’s length at most. Pair the right side of one half with the right side of your bottom circle and then pin them together. Then pair the other half’s right side with the right side of your rectangle, and do the same.Continue unzipping the zipper a little bit at a time, pinning its halves to the bottom circle and rectangle as you go, until you reach the end.
Start sewing the zipper first, using your sewing machine’s zipper foot, with a seam allowance of a quarter inch (0.61 cm).
Once the zipper is sewn to both the bottom circle and the rectangle, sew the circle and rectangle together as you did with the first circle.

, If you are using an alternate filler, like packing peanuts, simply pour it into the inner bag through the open zipper or gap. If you are using expanding foam, place the sealed package inside the inner bag. Then slit it open, remove the packaging, and zip the bag shut as the foam expands.If you didn’t use a zipper for the inner bag, pin and sew the gap shut once your filler is inside.
Once your inner bag is sealed, stuff it into your cover, zip your cover shut, and you’re done!

You can choose to abide, or use a more multi-sex color like yellow, red, or greed. Buy a roll of cheap plain fabric and the softest material (perhaps felt, not muslin) you can find with the desired color. There is the option to dye it.;
, It should be springy, not something the baby could sink their head in to. Do not go overboard with expensive stuffing; a cheap, bouncy stuffing can be purchased at most warehouses.

, Sewing with a needle and thread is enjoyable to some, while for others, it's a pain. If you do not have your own sewing machine and you would rather not do it manually, borrow a friend's. Put the sewing machine aside and take out the cheap fabric.

, It should be roughly 28 centimeter (11.0 in) by 28 centimeter (11.0 in) or 25 by 25. Iron both pieces. Leave one side unsewn, and leave yourself a 1.5mm seam allowance. Use a color thread that is the same as your outside fabric. Start sewing!

, This is your inner. Put it aside where it will not be damaged. The outer squares should be approximately 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) higher and wider than the inner. Cut out the outer squares, being careful to cut evenly; the outer is the best looking part.

, Iron both pieces. Sew it like the inner, leaving one side open for stuffing. This time leave a 20mm seam allowance. After sewing, stuff the inner into the outer via the open side but do not sew shut.

, eg. original thread color- green; change to blue. Original thread color- red; change to pink. Sew the opening shut.

, Sew those on and there you have a not-quite-finished baby pillow. Make sure to wash before giving it to somebody.

, Newborns are highly prone to illness so make sure it is free of bacteria. There you go!

Keep going until you've created a bracelet-sized chain.,
Finish the bracelet.",How to Make Loom Band Patterns Without the Loom1," The single chain pattern makes it easy to incorporate as many colors as you want. Decide whether you want the whole bracelet to be the same color or if you want to make a pattern with more than one. You could alternate colors or incorporate every color of the rainbow.


You might want to count your rainbow bands to make sure you have enough of the colors you want. If your run out it will be noticeable in your finished bracelet. You will need 25 to 30 bands total for this bracelet.
Organize your bands in an organizing case, so you can separate all the different colors. If you don't have a rainbow loom organizing case, you can just as easily use a bead organizer or a jewelry box with lots of compartments.;
, That's the little clear plastic clip that's used to connect the ends of the bracelet. Pull the first rubber band into the space in the ""C"" so that it stays inside the clip.

, Take the same band and stretch it a little so you can slide it down to the middle of a pencil. The pencil will help you hold the pattern in place as you create it, taking the place of a loom.


Use a pencil that's narrow enough so that the band fits over it loosely. If the band is too tight, it'll be hard to slip it off the pencil, which you'll need to do as you create your pattern.
You can also use a popsicle stick or a chopstick if you don't have a pencil handy.

, Rest the pencil on the table in front of you so that the first band is sticking up. Now pinch the second band and slip it under the first band. The pinched second band should be perpendicular to the pencil., When you pull up the two ends of the second band, they'll form two loops that are separated by the first rubber band. Take these two loops and loop them around your pointer finger.

, That first band has done its job, so you can slide it right off to make way for the next part of the pattern.

, Transfer the loops that you're holding with your finger onto the pencil. Slip them down to the middle of the pencil so they won't fall off.

, Take the third color you're using, pinch the band to make it flat, and slip it under the two loops of the second band that are around the pencil. Bring up the two loops of the third band and slip them onto your pointer finger to hold them in place.

, Carefully slip the loops off so that the second band becomes part of the chain. Are you seeing the pattern start to form?

, Transfer the loops that you're holding with your finger onto the pencil. Slip them down to the middle of the pencil so they won't fall off.

, Continue the pattern of slipping a new band under the loops of the old band, putting them on your finger, sliding the old band off the pencil and slipping the pencil under the new bands. As the chain grows, you can periodically wrap it around your wrist (or your finger, if you want to make a ring) to see if it's long enough.

, Slip the last band off the pencil and hold the loops with your fingers. Take the C-clip and insert the two loops into its center. Now the two ends of the bracelet are joined together, and the bracelet is complete.


Try it on to see if you like the size. If you want it to be smaller, just pull out the last few bands until it's the right length, then rejoin the ends with the C-clip.
To make a longer bracelet, slip the 2 loops of the last band back over the pencil, then add new bands as needed.

Choose at least 2 band colors.,
Twist the first band around two pencils.,
Slip 2 more bands over the pencils.,
Bring in the loops of the first band.,
Slip another band over the pencils.,
Bring in the loops of the lowest band.,
Keep going until the fishtail is long enough to make a bracelet.,
Finish the bracelet.",How to Make Loom Band Patterns Without the Loom2," This pattern looks great with alternating colors, so choose your favorites. You can also make a fishtail using more than 2 colors if you'd like. Since this is a tighter pattern, you'll need about 50 bands total.

, Hold the pencils together so that the eraser ends are facing up. Now take your first rubber band and twist it around the pencils so that it makes a figure 8 around them, with one loop around each pencil. Scoot the figure 8 down the pencils a little to make sure it won't slip off.

, This time, don't twist them — simply slide them over both pencils. You should end up with a little stack: first comes the twisted band, then a couple more bands that are slipped over both pencils.


Remember to alternate your colors. The third band should be the same color as the first one, with an alternating color in between.

, Start by holding the pencils so that they're facing you. Now use your fingernails to grasp the right loop of the first band (the twisted one). Pull it up over the other bands and over the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils. Now do the same with the left loop of the first band: grasp it with your fingers, pull it up over the other bands and the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils., Don't twist it, just slip it around both pencils and scoot it down so that it's resting on top of the last band. Make sure to use your contrasting color.

, Hold the pencils to that they're facing you. Now use your fingernails to grasp the right loop of the lowest band. Pull it up over the other bands and over the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils. Now do the same with the left loop of the lowest band: grasp it with your fingers, pull it up over the other bands and the tip of the pencil, then let it drop in between the pencils.

, Keep adding a band to the top and bringing in the loops of the lowest band. Each time you do this, another segment of the bracelet will form. Keep going until the fishtail is as long as you want it to be.


To figure out when it's long enough to make a bracelet, wrap the fishtail around your wrist. It's ready when the two ends are long enough to meet.
You can also stop after just a few segments if you want a fishtail ring.

, When it's as long as you want it, carefully slip the final loops off of the pencils. Use a C-clip to hold all of the loose loops together. Finally, pull up the first loop from the beginning of the bracelet and connect it to the other end by slipping it into the C-clip. Your bracelet is complete.


If you want the bracelet to be longer, just loop the last few bands back over the pencils. Keep adding bands and bringing in the bottom loops until it's long enough, then fasten the ends together with the C-clip.
If it's too long, you can just pull out the last few bands until it's the right length, then fasten the ends with the C-clip.

Finish the bracelet.",How to Make Loom Band Patterns Without the Loom3," You can make this pattern with just one color, but it looks great with 2 or 3. You'll need about 50 bands total, so count up to make sure you have enough of each color.

, Hold a fork so that the handle is up and the tines are facing you. This will act as your loom. Take the first band and loop it around the outer right tine. Lift it with your finger and thumb.

, Take the looped band and twist it. Loop the end of the band over the next tine in line. Then pull the end toward you, twist it, and loop it over the next tine in line. Finally, pull it out once more, twist it, and loop it over the last tine.


This sounds tricky, but once you get the hang of it you'll be able to do it really quickly. If you need help handling the tiny band, you can use a crochet hook to help you pull it out and twist it.
Once the band is twisted around all of the tines, push it down a bit so that the twists are in an even line. Pull on either end to adjust the band so that all the twists are the same size.

, Using the exact same technique, add a second band. Choose the next one in your pattern, whether it's the same color or a different one. Loop it around the outer right tine, twist it, loop it over the next tine, twist it, loop it over the next one, twist it, then loop it over the last tine. Push it down so that it's stacked up against the first band.

, Orient the fork so that the tines are pointing down. Take a look at the outer right tine of the fork: you'll see a stack of two loops. Take the top loop (the one closer to the handle of the fork) and pull it over the bottom loop and over the tip of the fork tine. Do the same with the other tines: take the top loops and pull them over the tips of the tines.

, Take the next color in your pattern, loop it over the outer right tine of the fork, twist it, then loop and twist it around the remaining tines. Now you have a stack of 2 looped bands on the fork again.

, With the fork oriented so that the tines are pointing down, look at the outer right tine. Take the top loop (the once closer to the handle of the fork) and pull it over the bottom loop and over the tip of the tine. Do the same with the other tines: take the top loops and pull them over the tips of the tines.

, Loop the next band in your pattern around the tines, then weave the loops by taking the top loop on each tine and pull it up and over the tips of the tines. Keep adding new bands and weaving the loops until the bracelet is big enough to fit your wrist.

, Transfer the remaining loops from the fork to your finger, then hook them into a C-clip to hold them all together. Finally, pull up the first loop from the beginning of the bracelet and connect it to the other end by slipping it into the C-clip. Your bracelet is complete.

, Now, loop a band from the first peg on the left to the second peg on the left, then from the second peg to the third.

, Keep adding bands like this down the left side until you get to the second to last peg.

, Next, loop a band diagonally from the second to last peg to the last middle peg.

, Go back to the starting peg and repeat the steps you just finished but for the other side. When you're done you should have bands making a line around the outside edge of the loom., Push all of the outside bands down to the bottom of the pegs that they are on. This will give you space to put on more bands.


This is easiest if you use your hook but you can also use your fingers or the back of a comb.

, Place a band in Color 1 (this can be whatever color you want it to be) between the second peg in the middle row of the loom and the second peg of the right row. Next, in a clockwise motion, place five more bands, using the peg in the middle row as the center. This should make a star-burst shape (sometimes called an asterisk).


Keep pushing all of the bands down as you go. This creates more room for later.

, Add a band from the fourth peg in the middle row diagonally to the fourth peg in the right row of the loom. Add the clockwise bands again, in the same manner as with the first star-burst. You should have a new star-burst with a bottom that overlaps with the top of the first star-burst. Keep doing this until the whole loom is filled (inside the outer ring that you made in the first section).


Push down the bands each time.
You can change the colors of the bursts if you want to. They can each be a different color or they can be the same. It's up to you!

, Double up a band so that it makes a little circle. This band should be the same color as the outer ring. Place it on the final peg in the middle row of the loom. Do this again and put it at the center of the star-burst. Keep adding these doubled bands at the center of each burst until you reach the end of the row of bursts.


You should end up with something like this:







, Turn the loom around so that the arrow is pointing at you.

, Hook the bottom loop of the first star-burst and pull it up. You'll need to grab it from under the outer bands. Be careful not to mess up the other bands on the peg when you do this.

, Pull it up and loop it onto the center peg.

, Get under all the bands at the center peg of the star-burst and grab the band that is the next band on the right from the bottom arm of the star-burst. Grab it with the hook and pull it over so that you can loop it onto the peg with the other half. Keep going in a counterclockwise motion until you've done this for all of the bands in the star-burst. Then do the same thing for all of the star-bursts on the loom.


These should now look like a flower or a sun, if you did it correctly.
Be careful not to dislodge the other bands on the pegs.

, Starting with the band that goes around the bottom left and bottom center pegs, grab the end that's wrapped around the bottom center peg and pull it up (without dislodging the other bands).


And then weave it over the bottom left peg, so that both ends of the band are on that peg. Then, do the same for the band which wraps around the bottom left and second to left pegs.






Proceed until the entire left side is done, ending when you hook the last left side band onto the last middle peg.







, Go back to the start or bottom and do this same thing on the right side of the loom.

, Reach the hook down through all of the bands on the last middle peg.


Grab a new band that you hold in your fingers, pull it up through the bands, and then slide your hook through the loop of the new band, so that it's completely wrapped around the hook.







, With the loop still around it, hold the hook in your hand. Now, pull the whole bracelet off the loom. Be gentle and go slowly.


You might have to wiggle it side to side just a little bit to get the bands to come off.

, You will need to add new bands onto the loom in order to create an extension so that the bracelet will actually fit. Place five bands all down one side.


Loop a band from the first peg onto the second peg. Now, place another on the second peg and loop it onto the third. Continue like this, third onto the fourth, and so on until you reach the end.

, Take the first loop on the end of your bracelet opposite from the hook and pretend like it's another rubber band. Add it to the chain you've started on the loom. Now, chain the bands from the end with the bracelet all the way down to the first band.


In other words, hook the bottom band on the next peg after the base of the bracelet and pull it up and down to hook onto the third peg from the bracelet. Keep hooking and looping until a single chain is formed.
You can also make other forms of extensions if you have another design that you like better. It only needs to be attached to the bracelet in this standard way.

, Add a C clip to the last band on the loom. Now you can take the chain and bracelet off the loom, and then clip the C clip onto the loops on the hook. Take the hook out and you're done!

, You can also make many others by following wikiHow's other tutorials for the Rainbow Loom™.

Enjoy.",How to Make a Single Loom Bracelet1," You can use random colors, or you can try to pick colors that complement one another. Consider what you want your bracelet to represent. For example, you can choose your favorite colors, the colors of your favorite sports team, or seasonal colors (e.g. orange, black, and purple for Halloween).


Consider buying a rainbow loom kit if you plan to make a lot of bracelets. These kits feature bands in a variety of colors. You can buy a kit online or in an arts-and-crafts store for as little as $10.
Try writing down the order of the colors so that you don't forget. For example, if you have chosen to use red, blue, and green bands, assign a number to each color: red (1), blue (2), green (3). If your design is more complex, it is even more important that you plan out the specific color order.;
, Make a loop on each finger—the band should look like a figure-eight or an infinity sign. You can also use a metal fork. Instead of using two fingers, wrap the rubber bands around two tines of the fork.








, Do not twist this band into a figure-eight. Instead, make a single loop over your middle and index fingers.








,, You just need to loop a new band onto your index and middle finger—above the previous band—then pull the previous band over the new band, your index fingertip, and your middle fingertip. Be sure to refer to your color order so that you don't make any mistakes.









If you are making a bracelet for yourself, consider measuring your wrist—and then the bracelet—to make sure that your new accessory will fit. Hold a string tight around your wrist (as tight as you want the bracelet to fit) and then measure the length of the string. Your bracelet is done when it's as long as the string.
If you are making a bracelet for someone else, think about how their wrist size compares to yours. If they have bigger wrists, make the bracelet slightly longer than you would for yourself. If they have smaller wrists, make the bracelet slightly shorter.

, Make sure that there is a band still looped on your middle and index finger. Attach the C-clip or S-clip to the end to hold the band together.








, You can wear this bracelet, give it to a friend, or use it as a decoration. Try making a few bracelets that complement each other. As you gain experience, you can experiment with more advanced designs.

, The open, concave end of the curve should face toward you like a ""frown."" Stretch the rubber band over the peg beneath. Then, hook the next color over the second peg to the one before until you have your desired length.









It may take some trial and error before you get the length of your bracelet right.
If your loom is not long enough for your preferred length, you can move down the loom in an S-pattern. Alternately, once you have loomed a section, you can join it to another chain.

, You can also loop this band over the peg three times for a smaller hoop, to which you will later attach an S-clip or C-clip.








, Slip the hook inside the ""frown"" through the loose or triple band. Hook that band, then bring it back up through the ""frown"" over the peg. Make sure this band is not caught on the peg, and is only still attached to the loose or triple band. Hook the band to the peg above the peg from which you moved it.









If you made your chain in the S-shape, simply follow the pegs back the way you came.

, Hook the band at the bottom of the peg (the one stretched over two pegs), and bring it up through that ""frown"" (between the peg and the bands), thus unhooking it from its peg and re-hooking it to the peg above.








, Slowly pull your bracelet from the loom. If your bracelet falls apart when you remove it, you did something wrong.








, Make sure to grab all the band on the top peg. Starting at the bottom of your chain, unhook the bands from the pegs going back up your chain until it is free from the loom. To finish the bracelet, attach the S-clip or C-clip to the free end of the chain in the loop that is right at the bottom.









If you want to add more length to your chain, start at the top peg again and link bands into your desired length. Instead of adding another loose or triple band when you reach the bottom peg, simply hook the original chain (where the S-clip or C-clip hangs) to the last peg.

Done!",How to Make a Rainbow Loom Bracelet1," Read the instructions that came with your loom and set it up like the directions say. Make sure the U-shaped pegs are facing up. The arrows should be facing away from your body.;
, Place your first rubber band diagonally on a peg. Starting with the first middle peg is recommended. It doesn't matter what side you go to when you move the band diagonally, but stick with it.

, Place the second band diagonally from the first band, with the last peg you placed a band on serving as the starting point.

, Repeat those steps, reversing the direction of the diagonal each time, until you have what looks like a zig-zag all the way down the loom.

, Flip the rainbow loom so now the pegs are facing downwards. The arrows should be pointing towards your body. This will help you grab the bands to weave them.

, Use the hook to grab the second band on the first middle peg from underneath the first band.

, Flip the band on your hook so that it bends in half (bent over the band above it) and place it over the second peg in the next row. Whether it is to the left or right depends on what you chose earlier.

, Continue the process across the whole Rainbow Loom. You should end up with something that looks like the image above (like a series of connected circles).

, Get a C-clip or an S-clip from your kit. Hook it onto the last rubber band.

, Remove the rubber bands from the loom, carefully. Stretch the bracelet out.

, Connect the end of the bracelet to the C-clip.

, Enjoy your new bracelet. Now that you're finished, keep making more!

",How to Make a Rainbow Loom Bracelet2," With the arrows pointing up, loop a band from the first center peg to the first left peg.


Next, loop a band from the first left peg to the second left peg, then the second to the third.






Continue down the left line until you reach the second to last peg.






Then loop a band from the second to last peg diagonally to the last middle peg.






Go back to the beginning and repeat this for the other side, until you have bands all around the perimeter of the loom. , Push all of the perimeter bands down.


Then, place a band in Color A (whatever color you want) on the second peg of the middle row and the second peg of the right row. Then place five more bands going from the middle row peg to each of the surrounding pegs, in a clockwise motion. This should leave you with a starburst or asterisk shape.






Push down all bands as you go.







, Place a band from the fourth peg of the middle row diagonally to the fourth peg of the right row. Do the clockwise bands again until you have another burst with a bottom that overlaps with the top of the first burst. Continue doing this until the whole loom is filled (inside the perimeter).


Keep pushing down the bands each time.






You can change the colors of the burst as you go.

Double up a band in the perimeter color and place it on the final middle peg. Then double up another at put it at the center of the burst.






Keep placing these doubled bands at the center of each burst until you reach the end.







, Turn the loom around so that the arrows are facing you.


Then, hook the bottom loop of the closest starburst from the first middle peg and pull it up (careful not to dislodge the other bands on the peg)






Loop it onto the center peg.







, Next, starting from the center of the burst and moving counter-clockwise, use your hook to grab the first half of each band and loop it onto the peg it starts on (going center, peg, center, peg, center, peg, and so on). Always be careful not to dislodge the other bands on the center peg. You should be left with something that looks like a flower or a sun. Do this process for all of the bursts.

, Starting with the band that goes around the bottom right and bottom center pegs, grab the end that's wrapped around the bottom center peg and pull it down (without dislodging the other bands)


And over the bottom left peg, so that both ends of the band are on that peg. Then, do the same for the band which wraps around the bottom right and second to left pegs.






Proceed until the entire left side is done, ending when you hook the last left side band onto the last middle peg.






Then go back to the start and do the right side of the loom.







, Reach your hook down through all of the bands on the last middle peg.

Place your next rubber band on the loom.,
Take the bottom rubber band and bring over the top.,
Continue this process until you have your desired length.,
Take your fishtail off the loom.,
Remove the two rubber bands.,
Add a C clip to your bands.",How to Make a Rainbow Loom Fishtail1," This rainbow loom fishtail can consist of all of the colors in the rainbow or a few colors. Choose the colors you would like to go in your fishtail. You can create a pattern by alternating different colors, or you can do a section of one color and then a section of another color. Making a fishtail with a loom will also require a hook, like a crochet hook.


You can use your fingers instead of a hook if you don't have a hook on hand. However, a hook will be easier because it can better grab the rubber bands and you don't risk popping them on your fingers.
For the rubber bands, you'll need to use the ones specific for rainbow loom. You may be able to find them at your local craft store or online. You should also be able to find your loom online at a loom store.;
, Face your loom so that the two pegs you will be working with are at the bottom right corner of your loom. Your loom should be facing so that it is long horizontally and short vertically and the arrow on the loom should point to the left. Take your rubber band and twist it into an eight. Then place one side of the eight on the first peg, and stretch the other side over to place on the second peg.Once you have placed your rubber band, slide it down onto the pegs so that you have more room to add other rubber bands.
On a loom the pegs will alternate between short and tall. You will be using two tall pegs, which will have a very short peg in between them. You never use the short pegs -- they are just there to create space between the pegs you do use.
If you want a thicker bracelet, each time you are supposed to place one rubber band, place two instead. You'll be repeating the same steps, but working with double the amount of rubber bands., Taking your next color, or your next rubber band, place it over the first two rubber bands. Then, take your next color or rubber band and place it on top of the previous rubber band you just added, making sure you stretch the rubber bands from the right peg to the left peg.At this point you should have three rubber bands on your first two pegs. The first one should be a figure eight, but the second and third should just be regularly shaped, with no criss cross in the middle.

, Taking your hook, grab hold of the right side of the bottom rubber band. Pull it up and over the top two rubber bands and then up and over the peg. It should then create a loop over your top two rubber bands. Repeat on the left peg, taking the rubber band and pulling it up and over the top two rubber bands and up and over the peg.At this point, you should have two loops around your pegs with the first rubber band you placed now creating two loops around the middle of the remaining rubber bands, holding them together.
Once you have done this, push the rubber bands down the loop so that you have more space to work.

, Take your next color or rubber band and place it on your looms, wrapping it around the two pegs you are working with. As you are working with your loom you should always have three rubber bands on the loom., Like you did in the previous step, you will use your crochet hook to bring the very bottom rubber band over the top rubber bands. Grab the bottom band around the right peg and bring it up and over the top two bands and then up and over the peg. Repeat on the left side.After this step you may need to tug on your rubber bands a little bit so that they are evenly stretched over each other. Then, push your rubber bands down and continue working.

, You will continue making fishtails by adding one rubber band above the extra two. You will then take the hook and move the very bottom rubber band over the top two. Then, you will add another rubber band and continue to repeat these steps until you have your desired fishtail length.Don't forget to push the rubber bands down after you've added them so that you have extra room to work. If you allow the rubber bands to reach the top of your loom you may risk them popping off, which can mess up your chain. Also, don't forget to pull your fishtail every so often to readjust the rubber bands.
At first, your fishtail won't look like anything but after you've added six or so chains you'll begin to see what your finished work will look like.
If you are making a bracelet, make sure it is big enough to fit around your wrist. However, since it is a stretchy bracelet, you don't want it too big that it won't stay on your wrist. When you think it is the right size, take your wrist and wrap your fishtail around it. If you have overlapping chain, you've added too many rubber bands. The rubber bands should barely meet each other -- when you have this length you can finish off your bracelet.

, Grab your fishtail in the middle, making sure the rubber bands don't come apart. Then, gently slide it off your loom, holding it with a tight grip. Once you have taken it off you should still have the two rubber bands creating two sets of loops. Your fingers should be on top of the rubber bands in the middle of the fishtail., Looking at your fishtail you should see what was previously explained -- you should see your chain and at the end of the chain you'll have the two rubber bands you just removed from the pegs. Holding tight to the middle rubber bands, gently slide the two rubber bands out of the middle rubber bands. You can slide them to the left or the right. When you remove them you should just have your looped rubber band that was holding them together., Use a plastic C clip and hook it to the end rubber bands you are holding. Take the lower part of the C and stick it through the first rubber band loop, and then the second. Then attach it to the other side by sliding the rubber bands on the opposite end of your fishtail over the top hook of the C.If your bracelet doesn't fit at this point, you can always go back and add more rubber bands or remove some of the rubber bands from the bracelet until it is your desired size.

Place the next set of rubber bands on your pencils.,
Reach your desired length.,
Pull the rubber bands off your pencils.,
Tie off your rubber bands and create your bracelet.",How to Make a Rainbow Loom Fishtail2," As before, you'll need to decide what colors you want for your bracelet. You can choose lots of different colors or just a few different colors. You'll need them in the specific loom rubber bands. You'll also need something to serve as your loom. Two pencils work the best, but you can also use your fingers. You'll also need a C or S clip to connect your bracelet together.If you use pencils, which will give you the closest thing to an actual loom, try to use dull or unsharpened ones. With sharpened pencils you risk stabbing yourself as you move the rubber bands over the looms.
If you find it too difficult to hold the pencils, you can try using your fingers. However, using your fingers might be a bit uncomfortable and it may be easier for the bands to slide off.

, Take your first rubber band and twist it into an eight. Then place one loop of the eight on the right pencil and the other loop on the left.You can use double the rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet. Instead of placing just one rubber band on your pencils, you can twist two or three rubber bands into a figure eight and place them on your pencils.

, As you did in the previous method, pick your next two rubber bands and place them one by one on top of your other rubber band. You will loop them around both pencils by stretching them across the outside of one pencil to the outside of the other. For a thicker bracelet, you can place three rubber bands instead of two., Using your fingers, grab the bottom rubber band, or rubber bands, and bring it (or them) up and over the top rubber bands you just placed. Take the right rubber band first, bringing it up and over the rubber bands and the top of the pencil. Then repeat on the left side.Tug on the rubber bands to readjust them and push them down lower on your pencils to keep working.

, Take your next color or colors and place one or two rubber bands on your pencils (depending on how thick you want your bracelet to be). Then, bring the bottom rubber band over the top rubber band you just placed as you did in the previous step.If you are doing the simple method, using only one rubber band instead of sets of rubber bands, you should just see two loops on your pencils. Bring the bottom loop up and over the top loop on each of your pencils. If you are using multiple rubber bands to create a thicker bracelet, just make sure you are still bringing the bottom rubber bands over the top rubber bands. You should see a separation in the rubber bands by the middle loops.

, Continue to repeat this process until you have your desired length. Then, attach the S or C clamp to the bottom of your chain, looping the hook through the rubber band loops., Take the rubber bands that are still wrapped around your pencils and gently pull them off, making sure you don't lose any of them. You can hold the middle rubber band loop, or you can grip the two side loops., Taking the two loops you just pulled off, stick one loop through the other loop. Then, pull the loop you just stuck through tightly, letting go of the other loop. This should create a nice knot at the end of your chain with one loop. Finally, connect that last loop to the S or C clamp and then you should have your finished bracelet!"

Place your keychain ring through the bands.",How to Make a Rainbow Loom Fishtail3," For this project you will need your loom, different colored rubber bands, a hook, a keychain ring, and some letters with rings to attach to your bracelet. Use the same amount of letters as you do the colors of your rubber bands. For a simplified version, choose three letters and three colors.


You can usually find letters like these in the jewelry section of a craft store or craft department. The rings are usually what go on the chain of a necklace or bracelet, but you will be inserting the rubber bands into the rings.You could do your initials, or spell out ""mom"" or ""bff."" Get creative with it and do whatever letters you want.

, To do this particular project, position your loom so that it is long vertically. Turn it so that the arrow on the loom points toward you and then pop out the middle row of pegs. Take the pieces underneath your pegs that are holding them together and pop them out. Then position them so that they are three pegs away from the end of your loom. You will be working with the bottom four pegs.At this point you should see two rows of pegs with a wide gap between them. The pegs are shaped like a horseshoe, and the opening of the horseshoe should be facing you.

, Take your rubber band and slide it through the ring of your first letter. Your letter should be in the middle of your rubber band and two loops of your rubber band will be on each side of your letter.If you don't want to use letters, simply twist your rubber band to a figure eight shape and place the bottom of the eight on the bottom left peg, and the top of the eight on the top left peg. You can continue to do this with the other bands, twisting your rubber bands into figure eights instead of adding the letters. You basically just need something in the middle of the band to hold it together.

, Take the left side of your rubber band and place it on the bottom left peg. Then, stretch it across, with the letter still in the middle of it, until you reach the top left peg. Then, place your next letter through another one of your rubber bands, using the same color rubber band., Take the left side of your second rubber band and place it on the top left peg, on top of your previous rubber band. Then, stretch it over to the top right peg and place the right side of your rubber band on that peg, leaving the letter in the middle.At this point the only peg you should have left is the bottom right peg. You should have a rubber band stretching from the bottom left up to the top left, and then, from the top left over to the top right. You should then have your first letter between the left pegs, and your second letter between the top left and right peg. Your final letter will be between the two right pegs.

, Using the same color rubber band, place it through your last letter. Then, place the left side of the rubber band on the top right peg, over the previous rubber band. Finally, take the right side of your rubber band and stretch it down to the bottom right peg, keeping the letter in the middle.Push your rubber bands down once you have added all three so that you can begin your next set of rubber bands. The letter charms should be pointing towards the middle.

, Take a rubber band of the same color and twist it into a figure eight shape. Then, place the bottom of the figure eight on the bottom right peg. Stretch the top of the figure eight across to the bottom left peg. At this point you should have created a square around your four pegs., Take your next color of bands and place them across the pegs. Stretch your first band from the bottom left peg to the top left peg. Stretch the second band from the top left peg to the top right peg. Then, stretch the third band from the top right peg to the bottom right peg. And finally, stretch your last peg from the bottom right peg to the bottom left peg.As you are placing your rubber bands, simply add them on top of the bands you have already placed. Each band that you place should be placed above the previous band you just placed.

, Repeat the same step, but with your third color. Stretch a band from the bottom left to top left peg. Then, stretch one from the top left to the top right peg. Stretch your third band from the top right to the bottom right peg. Finally, stretch your fourth band from the bottom right to the bottom left peg., Taking the very bottom band of your bottom left peg, bring it up and over all of your other rubber bands and over your peg using your hook. Then, take the bottom band on your top left peg and move it up and over all of the rubber bands and the peg., Staying on that same top left peg, take the next bottom band (it should be the same color as the first bottom band) and bring it up and over the top rubber bands and the top of your peg. Repeat this step on the top right peg and the bottom right peg, bringing the bottom rubber band up and over and then the remaining bottom band up and over., On your bottom left peg you should still have one remaining band of the first color your used. Bring that band up and over the top rubber bands and then over the top of your peg. At this point you should have four loops of rubber bands left on each one of your pegs.Once you do these steps, push your rubber bands down so that you can create more space to continue working.

, Use the same color you used for your very first set of rubber bands, and add a layer above the rest of your bands. Place the first band on your bottom left peg and then stretch it to your top left peg. Place another on your top left peg and stretch it to your top right peg. Place a third on your top right peg and stretch it to the bottom right peg. Finally, place a forth from your bottom right peg to your bottom left peg.

, Repeat the same step as before, bringing the first bottom rubber band on your bottom left peg over all of your rubber bands and over the peg. Then, on the top left peg bring the bottom rubber band up and over and then bring the next bottom rubber band up and over. On the top right and bottom right peg you will do the same thing. Then, finally on the bottom left peg bring the last bottom band up and over.On this step you should be bringing the second color you originally added up and over the rest of your colors. If you get confused as to what rubber bands to bring up and over, just pay attention to the colors. Make sure you are just working on one color. You shouldn't be messing with any of the other colors until the next step.
Once again, push your rubber bands down to continue working.

, You will now do this same process until you have your desired length. Add your next layer of rubber bands, using the same color as the color you just brought up and over the rubber bands. Then, bring the bottom rubber bands up and over and add the next color. Continue to repeat the steps to create a long chain.You will always add a layer of rubber bands that matches the previous layer of rubber bands you just used. If color three was just on the bottom and you brought it up and over the pegs, you will then add a layer of color three rubber bands, stretching them from the bottom left pegs all the way around and back to the bottom left peg.
Remember when you start to bring the bottom rubber bands over the pegs to move only one on the first bottom left peg. You will move both of the bottom bands on the next three pegs. Then you will move the final bottom band on the left peg up and over. Make sure to do this throughout.

, Once you have your desired length, bring the bottom row of bands up and over the top as you normally would. Then, instead of adding another layer of rubber bands, take the next bottom rubber bands and bring them up and over, repeating the same up and over process as you normally would.After you have completed this step you should only have one color of rubber bands left on your pegs. This set of rubber bands is what you will use to connect your key ring.

, Take your hook and stick it under the rubber bands on the bottom left peg, moving the hook upwards. Then, once the rubber bands are secure around the hook, gently bring them up over the peg, keeping them on the hook. Then, place your hook under the rubber bands on the top left peg and bring them up and over the peg, keeping them on the hook. Repeat this step on the last two pegs.Once you have finished this step you should have eight loops of rubber bands around your hook, with no bands left on the pegs.

, Open up your key ring, as if you are about to put it on another key ring, and place the open end through the bands on your hook. Make sure you get all of the bands on the ring, because if you don't your chain could begin to fall apart. Once they are on the ring, slide them around and then pull your hook off. Now you have a cute keychain!"

Set up your loom board.,
Choose the colors of your bracelet.,
Place your first plastic band in a figure-eight shape around two pegs.,
Place two more looms on the pegs above the first.,
Stretch the bottom loop over the top two loops.With your first three looms on the pegs, take your hook (either the hook that came with your kit or a crochet hook) and lift the right side of the bottom loom to begin your fishtail.,
Add a fourth band and repeat the fishtail pattern.,
Repeat the pattern with additional looms to create your bracelet.,
Stop at the desired length.,
Remove the bracelet from your loom board.,
Remove the excess bands.,
Add a C-clip.",How to Make a Fishtail Loom Bracelet," Many loom boards come fully assembled, while others require you to place the pegs into their stands. For this design, you’ll only be using two pegs. If you’re setting up your loom board, place these pegs near the edge of the board rather than in the middle to make weaving easier., Fishtail bracelets can feature an assortment of colors and patterns.If this is your first effort making one, choose two complimentary colors. Later, you can graduate to three or even more colors.If using two colors, create the simplest pattern by alternating your colors one after the other. For example, use a red band, then a white band, then red, then white, etc.
Once you've mastered the fishtail, you can create bracelets with any colors that you like.You can even create a rainbow-colored] fishtail.The choice is yours.

, Twist your Color 1 base loom and place each loop on adjacent pegs.

, These two don’t need to be twisted into a figure eight, simply wrap a Color 2 band and another Color 1 band around the pegs in two single circles above your original loom.

, Pull it up over the peg so that it loops over the top two bands. Do the same with the left side of your bottom loom., Add a Color 2 band above the others on the pegs. Again, it should be wrapped around normally—not in a figure eight. Take your hook and grab the right side of your bottom band. Lift it over your peg and place it in between the pegs. Do the same with the left side of your bottom band. You’ll now have two fishtail patterns.You always want to have three bands wrapped around your pegs before unhooking any of them.

, As you begin to add more and more bands, you’ll need to repeatedly pull your bottom fishtail towards you so that you make room to add more bands to the pegs., You can easily test this by wrapping it around your wrist while the pegs hold onto the end. Make sure you’re not pulling it to stretch it around your wrist, or it will be too tight when you try to wear it after it’s done.


Most fishtail bracelets typically require at least 25 looms.

, Pinch your last fishtail with your thumb and forefinger and remove the looped bands from the pegs. Be sure to pinch the end of the bracelet tightly or you could lose your pattern., You will no longer need the two bands that were holding onto your pegs. Still pinching the last fishtail, slide these bands out from between your fingers., Now that you’ve removed the two extra bands, you’ll notice that your last fishtailed-loom has excess space. Take a C-clip and hook it over this elastic. Be sure to hook both sides into the clip. Now hook your original elastic onto the other side of the C-clip. Your fishtail bracelet is ready to wear.


If you prefer, you can also finish the bracelet with an S-clip."

, This is the correct way to start stringing your bands through the loom. It won't work if you try to do it the wrong direction. , Take your blue band and place one end around the very first clear peg in the middle.

, The second peg should be found directly in front of the other end of the blue band. The tension of the band will hold the two sides onto the pegs.

, Now, using that first peg as a starter point, place bands connecting the middle peg to the pegs to the right and left of where you put your original band. So you want one vertical band and two diagonal bands. , Don’t follow the same pattern described in the previous step while moving up your loom. Just connect each band to the peg right in front of it vertically. This means you should have two straight line of bands. One line will be on the right pegs and the other line will be on the left pegs. You won’t move diagonally again until the end.

, Starting at the top of your loom where you left off, remove two of the blue bands connecting the middle pegs to one another. This will start taking you down your loom. , The colors are important to make the band look like a minion. , Take off the two blue bands to the left and the right of the bands you just replaced. You should be taking off four bands total. Now replace these blue bands with yellow bands too.

, The black bands should be at the very top of your loom. Once you add the three black bands, you'll have six more pegs remaining. Add one black band each to the left, right, and middle pegs at the top of your loom using pegs you have not yet connected any bands to. These bands should just connect to the peg directly above them. , These bands should be in a shape like your original band formation. Do it the same way you placed the bands when you started. You want one band going vertically and two going diagonally. Three of the bands will connect to the middle peg at the very top of the loom. Each of the bands will now be connecting to another peg in a line. Add one more yellow band to each of these pegs going straight down.

, Go all the way down to where you started and stretch a black band across all three of the first pegs. It should form an upside down triangle. , Take the loom and turn the whole thing on its other side. Don’t worry, you won’t break anything.

, You make a cap band by looping one band around the first peg that you started with a number of times. Imagine tying a hair tie. It’s the same idea. , You’ll find your hook inside your loom kit. It will have a hook on it, so you should recognize it pretty easily. It’s a long thing piece of equipment like a pencil.

, This will be from the first middle peg. Pull it up, being careful not to dislodge the other bands on the peg.

, Now, carefully move the bottom loop forward. Loop it around the center peg in front of it. Go slowly as to not dislodge any of the existing bands., Starting with the bands connected to the bottom center peg, grab the end that's wrapped around the bottom center peg and pull it down. Make sure not to dislodge the other bands.

, The idea is to have the band wrap over the band moving diagonally and connect to the bottom left peg, so that both ends of the band are on that peg.

, Do the same for the band that wraps around the bottom right and second to left pegs.

, You should stick your whole stick in there, not just the hook part. , The whole thing should come off if you’ve done it right. You want a band to be wrapped completely around your hook. This will give you the leverage to pull it all off. They shouldn’t stick to the loom. Don’t force it. , Add 5 blue and 5 yellow bands on the loom on the right side going vertically up and down. Add 5 yellow bands going vertically, and then 5 black bands. The black bands will not be on top of the yellow bands, just vertically above them on the loom. This is how you add the final part of your minion pattern.

, Only attach the very end, the part you pulled off, and connect that to the bottom of the ten bands you just put on the loom.

, This is a clip that comes in your kit. It will act as a way to secure the loom on your wrist. , Using normal household glue, add a googly eye in a position that you prefer. This will really bring the minion to life.

10-20 rubber or elastic bands in any color (or colors) you like.
A simple plastic loom. You can also construct a simple loom with two pencils, or by removing the two middle tines of a plastic fork.A plastic hook or pick tool.
A plastic ""S"" or ""C"" shaped clip. You'll need this clip to close your finished bracelet so that you can wear it.;
, You can use pencils, plastic forks, or other household items to form the two weaving pegs you will need for your loom. You can find a pick tool in most sewing or knitting kits. Crafts stores, such as Michael’s, and larger department stores, like Target, and online merchants, including Amazon, sell both fishtail braid kits and individual tools/supplies., Make a neat pile of the color you want your bracelet to be, or several piles of colors you want to use to make your bracelet. Having them available when you are weaving your bracelet will make the process go much faster.

, It's easiest if you turn the loom sideways so that it faces you. The direction of the arrows won't affect the finished product. It's more important that you are comfortable. Being comfortable you will finish your bracelet faster and with less difficulty.

, Do this by twisting your first band into a figure eight, sometimes called an infinity shape. Place each end of the band around one peg.









Push the band down towards the base of the pegs. This will make room for the next bands you add to your loom.

, Do not twist these bands into a figure eight, and do not cover one band with another. Slide your second and third band onto the pegs so that you have three regularly spaced bands on the same two pegs, with the bottommost band in a figure eight shape.








, Grab either end of your bottom band and, using your hook or pick tool, pull it up and over the peg so that it loops around the middle of your second and third band. Do this to both sides of your bottom band, so it is no longer attached to either peg.









The figure eight twist will still be intact, and now your bottom band will tied around the two top bands.
If you like, consider using a different color band at this point. This will give your bracelet a rainbow effect.

, You may need to slide the two bands already in place down to make more room for your new band. The new band you are adding will not need to be twisted, simply place it on the pegs above the other bands.








, Once you've hooked it, pull it up and over the peg in the same way you did the first band. Be sure you do this to both sides to completely release the bottommost band from the loom pegs.








, As you add bands to your bracelet, a fishtail pattern will develop. Keep going until you reach your desired length.









As you continue your pattern, you will see your fishtail bracelet grow out from between the two pegs.
You may need to push down or pull the fishtail to tighten the bands of your bracelet.

, Once you reach your desired length, slide your bracelet completely off of the loom. Your bracelet should have free loops on either side of the end that was connected to your loom. This is where you will attach your clip.








, Using either a ""S"" or ""C"" clip, you can connect the free loops at both ends of your bracelet to fasten it around your wrist.









Be sure you pull your pattern tight, otherwise it may have gaps or look poorly made.

, Make a neat pile of the color or colors you want to use for your bracelet. Having them ready for weaving will make the process go faster.

, With your palm facing your body, place one end of the band around your pointer finger. Twist the band into a figure eight, called by some an ""infinity shape,"" and loop the other end of the band over your middle finger.








, Do not twist these bands into a figure eight. Slide them over your pointer and middle fingers, leaving at least a small space between each band.








, Grab the edge of the bottom figure eight band using your fingers or a pick tool if convenient. Loop the hook around the edge of the bottom band and pull it up and over your finger. Do this for both sides of your bottom band until it loops solely around the middle of your second and third bands.









If you like, at this point you might want to change the color of your next band, which will give your fishtail bracelet a rainbow effect.

, You may need to slide your second and third bands lower on your fingers to make room for your next band. Place the next band above the two bands without twisting it into a figure eight.








, Once you have the band in your grasp, pull it up and over your finger in the same way you did the first band you wove with your fingers. First pull one side off your finger and then the other.

Add one clear glass bead on each.
Add one colored glass seed bead to the end, so that both ends of the wire are crossed through the bead.
Add another clear glass bead on each end. After tightening the wire, you will see a “bloom” pattern.;
,,, You should have a fairly symmetrical shape, with two blooms in the middle and tapered ends where two tube beads culminate in a small colored bead at the end.

, Then cross both ends together through another bead. Just repeat the actions until you get the ideal length.

, To do this, pull one end of the wire towards the starting seed bead. Then add one more colored seed bead on the bottom wire and string it through the starting bead as well. Cross pass one seed bead with both ends of the wire, as shown in the image.

, The beading methods are almost as similar as above, but the difference is that you should share the inner seed beads and tube beads to assemble the two layers together.

, Refer to the image and the directions in section 1.

, At this stage, you'll be finishing off the bracelet with two blooms in the center, between the existing four.


Cut out another section nylon wire of 100mm.
Share the tube bead and then group the 4 glass beads and seed beads as “bloom” like you did in the above steps.
After that, tie a knot at last and the whole seed bead bracelet making project is done!

",How to Make Boutique Hair Bows," Choose a 1.5-inch (3.8 cm) width for your first bow. Cut the end of the ribbon straight with a pair of fabric scissors.


A 22-inch length will make approximately a 3.5-inch (9 cm) bow. A 28-inch length will make a 4-inch (10 cm) bow.;
, They should each be 4 inches (10 cm) long.

, This thicker form of thread will make a sturdier stitch. Double knot the floss at the end of a 6-inch (15 cm) length of thread.

, Keep the rest of the materials close at hand.

, Take a lighter and hold the flame against the very edge of the ribbon where you cut it off the spool. Move the lighter along the edge so it will not fray.

, Crease the folded middle with your fingers so that you can see it when you straighten the ribbon again.

, You should see the center crease in the middle.

,, Place your index finger on one end of the ribbon. Slide it in a semi-circle until it is perpendicular to the center crease.


Lift it and align it with the bottom edge of the center crease.
Hold it on the center crease with your index finger.
The ribbon should loop into an awareness bow, like the top of the breast cancer awareness symbol.

, Bring the inside edge around on the opposite side and lay it flat on top of the other ribbon end. It should be facing the opposite direction.


You will have a figure 8.
Hold both ends to the center with your finger.

, Bring the center of the other loop of the figure 8 into the center stack. This will give your center bow two more layers that you must hold in place.


Pick up the bow, while holding the center in place to see if your loops are even., The opposite side will be the front of your boutique bow.

, You want to make small accordion fold that will hold the center of the bow in place on your barrette. Pinch the center horizontally, gather the fold and repeat.


These are extremely small folds., Make sure you insert the needle through all the material in your center section. Pull the thread through until the double knot catches at the end.

, Tie the string off near the double knot. Your bow should now be secure and you won’t have to hold it.


Cut off the excess string.

,, Grab a 4-inch (10 cm) section of thin grosgrain ribbon. You will wrap this ribbon around the center of the bow to hide your embroidery floss.

, Make sure it covers the embroidery floss.

, Be careful not to burn your fingers. Allow it to dry for 1 minute.

, They should meet at the back.

, You only need the ribbons to connect in the back.

,, Fold one end down and press it as hard as you can without burning yourself.

, Fold the opposite end on top of the first end and press it down.

, Find a metal clip that is smaller than your bow.

, Cut a small section of thin ribbon, heat seal the ends and hot glue it securely to the top of the clip.

, Press the underside of the bow onto the hot glue strip. Press down until you feel it is securely attached.

Pick your beads.,
Choose a type of string.,
Gather all remaining supplies.",How to Make Kandi1," Although any kind of bead could be used to make kandi, typically plastic beads are used. There are many different kinds of plastic beads though, and each offers a unique and interesting looks for your kandi!









Pony beads are the classic; big, round-edged beads that we all used as kids. These will give a chunky feel to your kandi.
Perler beads are smaller than pony beads but equally classic. These are the ones that could be placed in a mold and ironed over to create a solid, rainbow-hued plastic figure. These have straight edges, but are good for creating patterns in a cuff.
Peyote beads are similar to perler beads but have rounded edges and are sometimes made of glass. Think of them as a wider, smaller version of pony beads. These will give you the most intricate patterns, but are also the most difficult to work with.;
, Most styles of string will do as long as they have a bit of elastic in them to allow for stretch.









Using an elastic plastic string gives you the opportunity of continuing with the plastic theme the beads have, but is not as comfortable as cloth string. Plastic string begins to dig into your wrist over time and is therefore not preferred.
Cloth string with a bit of elastic is a good option as long as the string is not too wide.
Be sure that whatever string you use is thin enough that it could easily fit through any one of your beads twice.

, These will include a pair of scissors and, should you choose to use them, clasps to close the bracelet with.

"
Measure your string.,
Choose your beads.,
Prepare your string.,
String your beads.,

Now go show off your craftsmanship!








",How to Make Kandi2," To do this, wrap the string around your wrist and add an extra two inches of length to tie off the ends.








, You may want to decide on a pattern before you start stringing, or you might want a random selection of beads. Either way, it is good to make that decision before you start putting your kandi together.




, If you are using a clasp, you will need to attach one of the clasps to one end of the string; this will be the end your beads rest on. If you aren’t, fold the elastic in half. You'll have to be careful when threading the beads in the next steps to always hold on to both ends, so no beads slip off.








, For a single-strand piece of kandi, there is no special way to string them. It’s all up to you! Put enough beads on the thread that it is completely full except for an inch at the end.








, Tie off the end of your kandi with a knot. If you used clasps, add the second class to the end of the bracelet. If not, then simply use the two loose ends to tie in a knot around your wrist.








,"
"
Measure your string.,
Begin beading your cuff.,
Tie the circle shut with a knot.,

Show off your work!",How to Make Kandi3," Similar to making a single-strand piece of kandi, wrap your string around your wrist to get an estimated length. Then, unravel your string so that you have a significant amount more, about three feet in excess (3 feet makes about 8 rows).








, Choose a pattern of beads that you want; this could be very simple and geometric or a complete image. Many websites offer patterns you can use to produce an image on your cuff. Place enough beads on the string to completely encircle your wrist.








, You'll end up with one short end and one very long end of elastic. You will continue adding rows of beads onto the long end.








, To do this, continue past the stopping point of the first row in a circular pattern one row above. In the second row, string your thread every-other bead through a bead below it in the first row. This means your beads will be staggered between rows, not lined up vertically.








, Follow the same step as in #3, where you thread your string through a bead in the row below it every-other bead. Continue this for as many rows as you like, or until you run out of string. By this time, if you used elastic thread, your rows should start to stand up creating the more obvious cuff shape.









Tip: Always thread through the next high row bead.

, Do this at the end of a complete row so that your cuff is even. Thread your string through the last bead in the row beneath it and tie it off.








, Your cuff is now completed, and is ready to be worn or gifted as a token of friendship.

",How to Make a Pony Bead Bracelet," You can find these at just about any craft store, or in the craft section of stores like Walmart and Target. Pony beads are very inexpensive; expect to pay about 2 to 5 dollars for a bag of 500 to 1500 beads.;
, This usually isn't too far from the beads. The best kind of string to use is stretchy elastic cord, which comes in many different thicknesses. The best size for this project is around .7 mm. Any smaller is likely to break from stress and any bigger is a bit difficult to tie off effectively.

, While it is entirely possible to just put random beads on a string and tie it off; your bracelets will look much better if you take a few minutes to plan out your design. Play around with different color combinations and patterns. Take as much time as you want to do this. Come up with a pattern that you really like before moving on.

, An average bracelet will have approximately 25 to 32 beads on it, depending on the size of your wrist. Small children will usually only need about 20 to 25.

, Take the loose end of the string and unwind about a foot or so of string from your spool. No, you won't be using all of it, but it's always good to have a little extra room to work with. Now start stringing your beads on. Leave about an inch and a half of string at the loose end.

, Just make two good, tight square knots with your string. Try not to pull so tight that it breaks, but tight enough that it won't come undone. At this point the bracelet will still be attached to the rest of the string on the spool. Use some scissors to cut off the extra string near the knot. Now you've got a totally cool, unique bracelet.

Use the oval pliers to curve the sides.,
Braid into your wish bracelet.",How to Make a Wish Bracelet," To start, you'll need to gather your materials. Most of what you need for a conventional wish bracelet can be found at a local craft store. You will need the following:Hemp twine
Size 6/0 seed beads
Scissors
A clipboard or tape, which you'll use to pin down the twine as you braid;
, To start your bracelet, you'll need to cut your hemp. Cut the hemp in a length big enough that the bracelet will fit around your wrist or ankle. Do not just measure the diameter of your wrist or ankle, however, as you'll be braiding the hemp which will reduce its length. About 15 inches will work for most wrist sizes, although you may need slightly more or less if your wrist is larger is smaller. When making bracelets for children, you will probably need less than 15 inches.An ankle bracelet will be larger, so you may need more hemp. For an ankle bracelet, 20 to 24 inches may be necessary.

, To start, you'll want to tie your strands of hemp together in an overhand knot. You'll want to leave about 2 inches of slack, as you'll have to tie the bracelet together when you're done.An overhand knot is fairly simple. It's more or less a basic knot. Cross the end of the hemp over the rest of the hemp, making a Q-shape.Tuck the tail of the hemp through the Q-shaped loop. Then, pull at both ends until the knot is sufficiently tight.

, From here, you can begin braiding the three strands of hemp together. To secure the hemp, tuck the tied end under the clip on your clipboard. If you're not using a clipboard, use a small piece of scotch tape to secure the tied end on a flat surface. Then, simply braid the ends together for about 2 and a half inches.Keep in mind, 2 and a half inches will result in about a 7 inch bracelet. If you want your bracelet to be longer or shorter than this, braid down slightly more or less.

, Once you've braided the bracelet down sufficiently, you can begin adding your beads. Take the strand of hemp farthest to the right. Take one of your beads and thread it through this strand. Push the bead up until it's pressed against the end of the braid.Once the bead is near the edge of the braid, braid the strands as you normally would. You will end up braiding the bead into the center of the stands.
When you're done braiding, the bead should be closed into the braid with twine.

, Once you've added one bead, take the new righthand strand. Thread a new bead onto this strand, and then braid the bead into the bracelet. You should now have two beads that are braided into the center of the hemp strands., Continue this process until you've added as many beads as you want. Keep adding beads to the new righthand strand, then braiding them into the center of the bracelet.For a wish bracelet, some advocate adding 7 beads as 7 is thought to be a lucky number. However, there is no set number. Add as many beads as you want for your bracelet.

, Once you've finished adding beads, continue braiding the hemp strands together. You should keep braiding until you're about two inches away from the end of the strands., Once you reach the end of the strand, tie another overhand knot. Remember, you cross the end of the hemp over the rest of the hemp, forming a q-shape. Pass the end of the hemp through the loop made by the q-shape and pull until tight., Your wish bracelet is now complete. Wrap the bracelet around your wrist and tie the two ends together. Make a wish as you do so. Superstition dictates that once all the beads fall off, your wish will come true., A fun alteration to conventional beads are wishbone shaped charms. This can add to the wish theme of the bracelet. To make wishbone charms, you'll need the following materials. You should be able to purchase them at a local craft or hardware store.20 g wire
Round nose pliers
Chain nose pliers
Oval Wubbers pliers
Jeweler's hammer and block

, Use a ruler to measure your wire. You'll need about 30 millimeters, or 3 centimeters of wire for each charm. You should be able to cut the charm with a thick pair of scissors., From here, use your round nose pliers. Make a loop with the wires by twisting one end over the other, and then pulling downward. The loop itself should be small, with two long strands of wire hanging off either end. Remember, you're trying to create something like a wishbone, so keep this image in mind to gauge loop size.To make the loop look more like a wishbone, take your chain nose pliers. Twist the loop about 1/4 of the way around. The loop will now be sideways, with the strands hanging off on either side.

, You want to curve either side of the loop now. This will make it look more like a wishbone. Take your oval pliers and use them to gently curve either side of the loop inward.It can help to look at a picture of a wishbone online to figure out how much of a curve you want. The sides should be bent in slightly, but not curved to the point they're almost touching.

, You can braid your wishbone charm into your bracelet as you would braid in the regular beads. Slip the loop through the twine, push it to the edge of the braid, and then braid the wishbone charm into the center of twine."

Take the left loop under the right loop and pull tight.,
Arrange the ribbon loops.",How to Make a Hair Bow out of Ribbon3," The classic bow is tied in a similar way you would tie your shoe laces. For this, you will need about five to six inches of ribbon and an elastic hair tie.

, Make sure that the ribbon is smooth and has equal lengths on both sides.








, To do this, lay the two pieces of ribbon on top of one another, and then slide the top piece over to the left, making them side by side. This will set you up for the knot.








, Move the right piece up, over, and under the left piece, so that you create a loop. You will then move the right piece into the loop, and pull tight into a knot.








, This is the first step to create the actually bow loops. Simply lay the end of each ribbon tail over your index fingers to fold the ends and create loops.








, Then take the left loop under the right loop and pull tight.








, Try to keep the bow loops flat while you make the knot. This will help keep the shape of the bow once it is tied.








, Each loop should be the same size. Once they are even, cut the ends so they are the same length. Your hair bow should now be tightly fastened to your hair elastic and ready to be worn.









To seal off the tail ends, use one coat of clear nail polish to keep it from unraveling.

Make a boutique style layered bow.,
Cut your cardboard template.,
Wrap your ribbon around the length of the cardboard twice.,
Hold your wrapped ribbon in place.,
Slide the ribbon off of the template.,
Crease your bow with thread.,
Glue your bow on your desired hair accessory.",How to Make a Hair Bow out of Ribbon4," For this unique bow, there are several materials you will need to create a three inch long hair bow. Go to your nearest fabric store, and get the following:


23 inches of ribbon
Needles
Thread
Straight pin
Alligator clip
5 x 4 piece of cardboard
Sharp scissors or rotary cutter
Straight ruler
Hot glue gun

, To create the shape of your bow and hold down your ribbon, you will use a piece of cardboard to act as template. You will need to cut a square out of the center of the length of the cardboard that is one inch deep and 1/2 inch long.









Measure out the space you will cut with a ruler and trace it with a pencil. Use sharp scissors or a rotary cutter to carefully cut your cardboard.

, This will create the layered look of the bow. Use an alligator clip to keep the end of the ribbon held down as you wrap it around your template.








, Once you have wrapped the ribbon around the cardboard template twice, flip over the template, and use your straight pin to hold the ribbon in place. Push it through the cut out opening of the template so that it goes through the top and bottom of the ribbon.







, Be sure to carefully remove the ribbon, but leave the pin in the center to hold the shape of the ribbon.









Apply pressure on the pin while simultaneously holding your ribbon. You can now pull the tails of the bow out from the bottom of the ribbon to the left and right side. Your ribbon should begin forming an ""X"" shape.Pull each loop up to form an ‘X’ design. The goal is to fan out your bow to create more volume and shape on each side. You can move the loops how you would like by keeping pressure in the center to hold them in place.

, Take your threaded needle and make sure the end of your thread is already knotted so that it doesn't slide through your ribbon. Pull the needle through the bottom center of the bow while making sure your bow doesn't loose the ""X"" pattern.








Once you have wrapped your needle through the center of your bow several times, cut the needle from the thread and tie the thread in a knot.

, You can use a hot glue gun, or fabric glue, to glue your bow to a hair clip, headband, or hair tie.









Once the glue has dried, your bow is ready to wear.

Grab a few different colors of ribbon.,
Using the glue gun, draw a line on the edge of the first ribbon piece.,
Carefully place the second ribbon piece onto the wet glue.,
Draw another line of glue on the second ribbon piece.,
Carefully place the third ribbon piece onto the wet glue.",How to Make a Cheerleading Hair Bow1," If you are using 2 different colors, cut them both to 1 1/2 feet (.45 m) long, but cut two sections of one. If you are using 3 different ribbons, cut them all to be 1 1⁄2 feet (0.5 m) long. Also cut a 3 inch (7.6 cm) piece of any of the ribbons for the middle of your finished hair bow.









Don't worry about cutting your ends yet; we'll do that near the end.;
, Do it as fast as possible so it doesn't dry. If you can, have someone else helping you -- four hands work faster than two.









You probably don't want to get the glue on your carpet or nice counter top. Set down some newspapers or use a surface you're not worried messing up.

, Press down cautiously and wait to dry. Try to get it as straight as possible -- you want each color to be displayed equally.









If you have only two colors, be sure to have the odd color out in the middle.

, Do it fast! Pin down the ends of the first ribbon if you're worried about it moving.








, Be careful while you press down as to not burn yourself. You should now have a tri-toned piece of ribbon, in all your school's colors (or whatever colors you want).









Now the ribbon is complete and you can move onto forming the bow!

",How to Make a Cheerleading Hair Bow2," Make sure there are no unnecessary twists in the ribbon.








, Pinch the middle with your thumb and forefinger and squish it all together. You're not creating an actual tie and bow, it just looks like it.








, Don't worry about the extra length of the twist tie; it'll be done away with later.








, This will be used to secure the hair tie to the ribbon piece. Try not to use too much -- you don't want to get yourself gloopy. The technical term!








, Hold it there for about 15 seconds. The longer, the better. Hot glue is generally permanent, so don't worry about your ribbon coming off.








, Make sure the hair tie is under the ribbon to secure it in place. If the twist tie is still too long, cut off the excess.








,









Optional: You can remove the twist tie once the glue has dried or keep it there for extra strength. And, if you so choose, you can take that 3 inches (7.6 cm) of ribbon you cut out earlier and glue gun it over the twist tie to obscure it from view.

Find the right fabric.,
Choose a backing for the bow.,
Buy other bow-making supplies.",How to Make a Hair Bow1," You'll need about half of a yard of fabric to make one bow. The classic hair bow shape looks pretty with any type of fabric or pattern. Choose a solid color that matches your favorite outfit or go for a funky pattern that will make a statement. Consider the following options when you pick out your fabric:


Sturdy fabrics like cotton, linen or denim will make your bow stiff and well-shaped. Stretchy or limp fabrics will create a floppy bow. Choose a fabric with a texture that will create the look you want.
Large designs won't be completely visible once the fabric has been turned into a bow. Small polka dots, stripes, and other tiny patterns will show up well.;
, There are many ways to affix the finished bow to your hair. Look for the following options at your local craft store:


If you want to wear the bow as a barrette, buy a plan metal barrette to attach to the finished bow.
Consider gluing the hair bow onto a fabric or plastic headband.

, The fabric and the backing are the most important elements of the hair bow, but to complete the job you will also need these other supplies:


Thread to sew the bow. Choose thread that is the same color as your fabric or go with a contrasting thread that will stand out.
Fabric scissors.
Sewing pins to hold the bow in place while you sew.
A sewing machine or a needle you can use to sew by hand.
A glue gun or extra-strength fabric glue.

Cut the fabric into two rectangles.,
Fold the larger piece of fabric in half lengthwise.,
Sew the long edges together using a straight stitch.,
Turn the fabric right-side out.,
Fold the tube in half width-wise and sew the raw edges.",How to Make a Hair Bow2," Make the first rectangle 9 1⁄2 inches (24.1 cm) wide and 10 1⁄2 inches (26.7 cm) long; this will be the main part of the bow. Make the second rectangle 2 1⁄2 inches (6.4 cm) wide and 3 1⁄2 inches (8.9 cm) long; this will be the middle piece that cinches the bow into shape.

, Make sure the ""right"" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is brighter, is facing in. Only the ""wrong"" side of the fabric, the side on which the pattern is muted, should be visible.

, You can use a sewing machine or make the stitch by hand. Only sew the long edge, opposite the fold; leave the two short ends of the fabric open. You now have an inside-out rectangular tube with a seam down the longer side.

, Reverse it so that the bright side of the fabric is facing out. Lay the piece of fabric flat on the table and position it so that the seam runs down the middle of the tube, rather than the side.


Make sure the seam is directly in the center of the fabric by using a ruler or measuring tape to measure the fabric on either side of the seam. The sides should be equal.
Position the fabric so that the seam is on the top part of the tube, rather than the bottom part lying flat against the table.

, Using your sewing machine or working by hand, make a zig-zag stitch or a straight stitch along the unsewn, unfolded edges of the fabric. You now no longer have a tube, but a folded and sewn square. Reverse the fabric so that the new seam is facing inside.

Make a small tube.,
Fold the tube in half width-wise and create a loop.",How to Make a Hair Bow3," Fold the smaller fabric piece in half lengthwise so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing out. Use sewing pins to hold the raw edges together. Use a sewing machine or work by hand to sew a zigzag or straight stitch along the raw edges. Remove the pins and turn the fabric right-side out. You now have a small fabric tube.

, Use a sewing machine or work by hand to sew the short ends together with a zigzag or straight stitch. Reverse the fabric so that the new seam is facing inward. You now have a small fabric loop.

Pleat the bow base.,
Cinch the middle.,
Attach the bow to your chosen backing.",How to Make a Hair Bow4," Take the larger piece of fabric that you sewed into a folded square. Position it so that the seam is running horizontally through the center of the square. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch the fabric just above and below the seam, so that the seam is obscured and sandwiched between the pinched fabric. Continue pinching the fabric to make pleats above and below the seam until you have a total of 4 pleats: 2 above the seam and 2 below.


You might have to practice a few times to get the pleats just right. Try to make them as even as possible, pinching the same amount of fabric to create each one.
If you want more than 4 pleats, experiment with pinching the fabric to create more folds. Just make sure you have the same number of pleats above and below the center seam.

, Place a few pins in the center of the bow base through the pleats to hold them in place. Slide the cinching loop over one end of the bow base. Remove the pins and continue sliding the cincher over the base until it is positioned in the middle of the bow.

, Use a hot glue gun to glue the back of the bow to a plain barrette or a headband.

You can use a solid colored ribbon for this, but a pattern (such as polka dot) would look nicer. This will make the wings.Grosgrain ribbon is different from satin ribbon. It is not shiny and it has a bumpy/ribbed texture.;
, Fold both wing ribbons in half, widthwise. Match up the ends, then cut them at an angle. Unfold the ribbons when you are done.







, The ribbon only needs to be between 1½ and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) long. Use a solid color for this. This will make the body.








Choose a color that goes well with your wider ribbon. For example, if you are using a pink ribbon with white polka dots for the wings, choose a white ribbon for the body.

, This will make the antenna. Use the same color as your body ribbon.







, This is not completely necessary, but it is highly recommended. Not only will this make your butterfly look neater, but it will keep the ribbons from fraying. Light a candle or turn on a lighter. Hold each cut end of the ribbons over the flame for a few seconds until the ends melt slightly.








Do not let the ribbons burn, however.

, Make a crease or mark it with a pen or sewing pin.








, Set the wing ribbon down on your work surface with the wrong side facing you. Pull the left end towards the center. Twist the end upwards and pin it just past the center of the ribbon. When you are done, your ribbon should have a loop. The right side of the ribbon should be touching the wrong side.







, This time, twist the end downwards. Pin the end of the ribbon just past the center so that it is overlapping the left end. This will create a figure-8 or infinity-symbol shape.








You still want the right side of the ribbon to be touching the wrong side.
It is very important that you overlap the ribbon ends, or the butterfly won't hold together.

, Take the tip of the left loop and bring it towards the center of the ribbon. Pin it in place, with the wrong side facing down and the right side facing up.

Add additional rows.,
Finish your bracelet.",How to Make a Kandi Cuff1," For a basic cuff, you will need several feet of an elastic string, a selection of pony beads, and a pair of scissors. Although pony beads are classic for making a traditional kandi cuff, you can use any type of beads as long as the hole is large enough to fit your string through twice.;
, Depending on how large your wrist is and how wide you want your cuff to be, you will have to use varying amounts of string. Wrap the string around your wrist to get a general measurement, and then multiply this length 5-6 times over. Cut the string at this length; if you run out of string during the beading process, you can always cut and tie on a bit more.

, Tie a knot at the end of your string (leaving a small tail), and begin sliding on beads. Using about 25-30 beads is standard, but you'll just want enough so that the cuff will be big enough to slide on and off your wrist without being too loose.

, Pull the string and beads taut so that they are all lined up tight against the knot at the end of the string. Tie the short knotted end with the long loose end in a secure knot. Cut off the excess string from the short end, but leave the long end of the string intact..

, The second row is a bit slower-going than the first, because the process involves adding a single bead and then weaving the string through the previous row. To bead the second row, string one bead on the long end of the string, and then slide the string through the bead directly under and next to the bead you’re working with. Add another bead, and slide the string through the bead next/under it on the first row. Continue this process all the way around, until you reach your starting point.Add one bead to the string, then thread the string over the first bead and through the second bead of the first row. This is how you weave the rows together.


Because you’re skipping beads in the first row in order to weave the second row, your cuff will appear zig-zag with only two rows completed.

, Use the same process for adding the second row of beads to add the third row of beads. This time, you don’t need to tie the string off in a knot but can continue the process by adding beads to fill in the spaces. Slide a bead onto the string where there is a gap, and then attach it to the cuff by putting the string through the corresponding bead in the first row. Work your way all the way around the bracelet until you’ve created two full rows of beads, and tie off the string.

, Although you can technically have a complete cuff with only two rows of beads, many people prefer to add multiple rows in addition to the first two. Use the aforementioned method of weaving on beads to create an uneven row, and then adding another row to fill in the spaces.

, When you feel that your kandi cuff has been perfected, tie off the string and try it on for size! If at any point in the bracelet-making process you run out of string, you can cut an additional length and tie it to the ends, trimming off any excess to create a smooth transition."
"
Get your materials ready.,
Bead your first row.,
Bead the second row.,
Add the third row.,
Add the fourth row.,
Work your way back to the beginning.,
Complete the mirrored half of the bracelet.,
Finish your bracelet.",How to Make a Kandi Cuff2," An X-cuff is aptly named for the series of ‘X’ shapes that appear in the completed cuff. Because of its width, though, it requires a bit more string and beads than a regular cuff. It is also particularly attractive if you use an assortment of colors for your beads. Regardless, grab a spool of elastic string, pony beads of your choice, and a pair of scissors.

, Wrap your string around your wrist to estimate the length for the cuff, and then tie a knot on the end to secure it (leaving a tail). Add on beads in a color pattern of your choice, pulling them taut to the knot on the end. When you’ve beaded an entire row long enough to wrap around your wrist, tie the two ends together and pull the long end of the tail through the bead next to the knot.

, To bead the second row, you’ll be adding a series of beads to the string and then sliding the string through the first row of beads to weave them together. Slide 3 beads onto the long string, and then pull the string through the adjacent bead in the first row. Add another 3 beads, and tuck the string through the next bead in the first row. Continue this process until you’ve worked all the way around the bracelet, and then pull the string tight to secure it.

, The third row of beading is the same as the second, except that you will weave the string through the center bead (the middle bead in each set of 3 beads) from the second row. Slide the string through the row of beads in the second row until it comes out of the first ‘center’ bead. Then, add three beads, and tuck the end through the next ‘center’ bead in the second row. Continue this process all the way around until you’ve completed the third row, and pull the string tight.

, Repeat the process for the third row. Pull the string through the nearest ‘center’ bead in the third row, and then add a set of three beads. Pull the tail end through the next ‘center’ bead, and then add another three beads. Continue this process all the way around the bracelet until you’ve completed the fourth row

, With four rows of beads completed, you’ve probably noticed that the cuff is a bit uneven looking - the first row is straight across, but the fourth row is wavy. This is because you’ve only completed one half of the bracelet, and need to go back to the beginning to complete the mirror half on the other side of the bracelet. Carefully weave your string through your bracelet until you reach the starting point of your first row (where the knot is tied).


If you run out of string during this step, you can add more and trim the ends short so that the knot doesn’t stand out.

, Working away from the center on the opposite side of the bracelet, repeat the aforementioned steps for rows 1-4 of beads. You should end up with a total of 7 rows of beads, forming two large rows of stacking ‘X’ shapes.

, When you’ve completed the two halves of the bracelet, you’re ready to tie it off! Knot the end of the string multiple times so that the beads cannot slide off of it. Then, trim the excess off both this string and the other tail end (still somewhere in the center). With that, you’re done!"

, Add one dark bead on each string, and add one medium bead on each string.

, This pattern should look similar to the tightly-bundled section of beads (see the figure in the previous step) that are closest to the clasp.

, Now, put the two strings together, and thread one light bead through them. Continue in this fashion until you only have one more section to do before the bracelet fits you.


Along the way, make sure you check how much longer the bracelet needs to be every once in a while. If you overdo it, you're going to have to start all over again.

, It's fine if it slides down over the beads in this last section.

Choose three different colors that look good together, such as red, white, and yellow. If you pick two colors that are too similar, such as dark blue and purple, then the colors will bleed into one another.


You should measure the string to be able to wrap around your wrist at least twice -- having longer string will make it easier for you to comfortably braid the bracelet. You can cut off the excess string on the bottom when you're done with your bracelet.
You can also use colorful string instead of yarn to make your braided bracelet.;

But you can also use four strands of four different colors or even four strands of one color. Pick a color combination that appeals to you, like blue and purple.

, You'll need to use three strands of each for each of the four main threads. In this case you'll need two combinations of three strands of blue and two combinations of three strands of purple. Measure the string so that it is as long as the distance from your wrist to your elbow. This will create a comfortable length for you to braid the string and to the tie bracelet together when you're finished.

, You can tape the strands to a surface or pin them to a cloth. You should tie the strands together so that two strands of one color are on the inside and two strands of another color are on the outside. In this case, the two blue strands are on the inside and the two purple strands are on the outside.

, Cross the left purple strand over the left blue strand, and cross the right purple strand over the right blue strand. The purple strands should be crossed over each other as well. Now the outer strands are blue and the inner strands are purple.

Select your fabric.,
Create a flower petal pattern out of cardboard.Take a flimsy cardboard, as you’ll be tracing and cutting circles from the cardboard to be used as your fabric pattern––cereal packaging is ideal.,
Trace out the circles using the cardboard patterns.,
Create the petal formation for each circle.,
Round the edges of each distinct petal.,
Add three-dimensional details to the petals.,
Piece the flower together.,
Sew the flower into place.,
Add beading or sparkle to your flower.,
Attach the flower to the hair clip.,
Done.",How to Make Layered Flower Hair Clips," Choose a fabric that reflects your personal taste and matches the outfit (or various clothes) that you intend to wear the clip with. The fabric should be substantial enough to withstand cutting and assembling into a flower, which should be fine for most fabric types. When choosing, consider repurposing fabric from an item that's no longer needed, such as a favorite old skirt that had a lovely print or a linen you've cherished but that has since formed holes here and there (obviously, avoid the bits with the holes). About a ¼ of a yard (23cm) of fabric should suffice but it helps to have more so that you can make more than one clip (to share, cover your hair, whatever).


The fabric must be tolerant of heat, so that you can apply the hot glue gun to the edges to prevent fraying.
Consider mixing and matching fabrics. Since you’ll be creating a unique flower, you don’t have to create the bloom completely from one fabric.;
, Then, using a water glass, water bottle, keychain or similar circular guide, trace up to five circles on the cardboard in various sizes (four or five is an arbitrary but sound number––the amount of layers is entirely up to you––just don't overdo them). The different sizes are important to give the impression of varied petal sizes. Keep each circle as perfectly round as possible. Cut out the cardboard circle patterns.


If you have a mathematical compass ,you may have an easier time creating different circles. If not, find various household items to do the job.

, Using a light pencil or fabric pencil, trace the circles onto the back of the fabric. If the pencil marking is likely to show through, use an invisible fabric marker, the kind that fades after a few days. Once traced out, cut out each circle carefully using sharp, fabric-only scissors. Sharp scissors help to reduce fraying or fringing.

, Use very sharp, fabric-only scissors again and keep your hand steady when cutting.


Eye each circle and figure out where to make five even cuts. If you can't keep the spacing in your mind's eye, mark the tip of each line to be cut before starting.
Cut three quarters from the circle edge toward the center. Don't cut all the way to the middle––imagine leaving a large intact middle circle in place and only cut three quarters of the way to its edge.

, Using the sharp scissors, carefully shape rounded edges for each petal (five on each circle). Nature is imperfect, so some of your rounding can be too!

, There are a few ways you can do this, ranging from easy and safe, to a little more challenging and possibly flammable:


Purchase like-colored puffy fabric pens and draw over the edges of each flower petal. This will create a look of volume and may even add a little sparkle (some pens come with glitter or sparkle).
Hot glue the edges of each flower. This will seal and possibly add dimension to the flower. This may be slightly tedious as you may have to hold each flower on an angle to apply the glue without having it stick to something (like the table or another item). Lay on a cookie sheet covered in wax paper to dry.
Melt candle wax over the edges to make them curl slightly. This can be a little dangerous and should be done only by a responsible adult. It should be done somewhere free of flammable material. Light a candle and then hold one petal close to the flame (without actually placing it in the flame). Roll the edges and the heat will create a funky, curled edge. Do not attempt this with fabric liable to flare up––if in doubt, skip!

, Stack the flower petals on top of each other, placing the largest on the bottom through to the smallest on top.


Vary the placement of the flower pieces so that you can see different petal sections from each, individually created flower. In other words, avoid simply arranging them exactly one on top of the other.

, Thread a strong needle with thread that is the same color as your flower. Begin sewing from the bottom up (so that the knot stays on the bottom of the flower) and sew together in the center of the flower stack.


Choose a needle able to handle the fabric and the fact that it is thicker once stacked.

, Once the flower has been sewn together, you can decorate it further if wished. For example, glue a costume jewel in the center or add glitter glue over the petals. Other additions include sequins, buttons and little pieces of lace or ribbon.


Most items should attach easily with hot glue suitable for fabric. However, if you'd rather attach an item by sewing, this might prove sturdier in the long run.
Keep in mind the weight of any added adornments; less is usually best.

, Glue the flower to the hair clip and consider reinforcing it with thread, if needed.


Add a few dabs of hot glue to the bottom of the flower and then place on top of the hair clip. Consider opening the clip during the application phase so you don’t glue the clip together.
If possible, stitch the bottom of the flower to the clip for extra durability. This type of reinforcement is good for longevity and durability, and is recommended if a small child is to wear the clip.

, Make any adjustments if needed, such as snipping off loose threads, etc. It's time to try it on!

Gather your flowers.,
Prepare your flowers.,
Consider hot gluing some ribbon or leaves onto the clip.,
Consider hot gluing a circle of felt to the back of your flower.,
Start hot gluing the flowers onto the clip.,
Consider gluing some tiny rhinestones or beads to the center of your flower.",How to Make a Flower Hair Clip1," You can use both real or fake flowers for this method. Try to find some flowers that have a flat base or back, such as daisies. They will be easier to glue onto the clip.


Chose either real or fake flowers. Do not combine real and fake flowers on the same hair clip.
if you are using real flowers, choose something sturdy, such as chrysanthemum, mums, or daisies. You might want to pass on the delicate flowers, such as pansies and blue bells.;
, Make sure that your flowers and clean and free of dust (and in the case of real flowers, free of insects). You will also need to make sure that the back of the blossom is as flat as possible. Here's how you should prepare real and fake flowers:


Cut fresh flowers off the stems. Trim single flowers, such as daisies, as close to the base as possible. This will make it easier to glue it onto the clip.Discard the stems.
Pull fake flowers off the stem. Then, use a pair of sharp scissors to trim down the plastic nub at the base of the flower.Discard the stems.
If you are using tiny flowers, such as baby's breath, keep them in small bunches. Don't trim them down all the way to the base of the flower.
Consider saving the leaves from your flowers. They can make great fillers.

, This will help hide the metal part. It may also make your hair clip look fuller. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Glue two to three leaves onto the clip with the points facing outward, like rays on a sun.
Glue several leaves down the center of the clip, with the points overlapping each other like scales.
Glue a strip of ribbon onto the top of the clip to hide the metal.
Glue several long strands of ribbon to one of the ends of the clip.

, This is not necessary, but it will help give it some stability. The felt circle should be large enough to cover the back of the flower, but small enough so that you can't see it when you look down at the flower.Try to use a felt color that matches your flower color.

, Place the glue onto the clip first, then press the flower into the glue. You can arrange them in any pattern your want, but here are some ideas to get you started:


Work in odd numbers. This will make your piece look more natural and organic.
Work from large to small. Place the largest flower at one end of the clip, and work your way towards the other side, using smaller flowers as you go.
Use all the same size flowers on a barrette clip. If you have small flowers, such as chamomile or mini roses, you can glue them down the center of the clip.
Use the largest flower in the center of the clip, and place the smaller flowers to the left and right of it.
Place a large flower in the center and use filler, such as baby's breath or leaves, around it.
If you are using a real flower, consider using a safety pin to attach the fresh flower to the clip. Slide the needle through both of the felt parts., This is not necessary, but it can give your flower some extra sparkle. Choose tiny rhinestones instead of large, clunky ones for a more professional finish.

Hot glue the flower onto the hair clip.",How to Make a Flower Hair Clip2," You will be pulling the flowers apart and rearranging them to make your own flowers. Get a few different types of flowers in different shapes, sizes, and colors so that you will have more shapes and colors to work with..


Great fake flowers to use include roses, chrysanthemums, and mums.

, They should pop off easily. Discard the stems, as you won't be needing them. If you want, you can save the leaves for filler.

, Pull the plastic nub off of the back of the flower. Then, pull the different layers apart. Discard the plastic stamen, center, and nub.


If you want, you can separate the petals into different groups based on shape, size, and color. This will keep your work area more organized and make it easier for you to find what you need.

, Make sure that you keep the layers stacked. You can combine more of the same flower to create a fuller flower. You can also take out petals from a flower you don't like., Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. There should already be a hole in the center of each petal; use this hole as your guide.

, Some beads have a very small opening, so you may need to switch out your sewing needle for a beading needle. Once you have the bead on the thread, switch back to a regular sewing needle. Beading needles are too delicate to go through all of those petals.Try using a pearl bead, or a faceted crystal bead.

, Once you have your bead on the thread, hold it against the petal. Then, push the needle back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom.

, This will make the flower more sturdier. The felt circle should be big enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you won't see it when you look down at the flower.


Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower.

, If you saved any of the leaves, glue those down onto the clip first. Then, glue the flower down.

Glue the flower onto the clip.",How to Make a Flower Hair Clip3," Most bolts of fabric in a fabric store will have a label at one end. The label will tell you what the fabric is made out of. Look for something that says 100% polyester. This is very important. You will be using a candle flame to burn away the edges, so you want something that melts under heat. Natural fabric, such as cotton, will burn.


Consider using any of the following types of fabric: organza, chiffon, or satin.Consider mixing and matching different types of fabric to create an interesting texture.

, Make the circles a little bit larger than you want them to be, as they will shrink when you hold them above the flame. The size of the circle will be the size of your flower; you can add petals later.


Consider making the circles slightly different sizes. This will add some texture and variety to your flower.

, The best candle to use for this is a tea candle, but any candle will do so long as it is stable enough.

, Hold the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) away from the flame.Slowly rotate the circle until the entire edge is lightly singed. The edges will melt and crinkle.


If the flame is too hot for you, consider holding the fabric with a pair of tweezers.
If the fabric melts quickly, pull the fabric further away. If the fabric doesn't melt, hold it closer to the flame. If the fabric doesn't melt at all, check to make sure that it is 100% polyester.

, This is not necessary, but it can make your flower look more organic and realistic. After you melt edges, cut four slits, about a third of the way, into the flower.Keep the slits evenly spaced. Pull a slit open and hold the flower above the flame. Keep it as far as you can so that the raw edges can still melt, but not burn., Place the circles on top of each other in a stack. Play around with different sizes and textures until you get the layering you want.


Consider using an odd number of petals instead of an even one. This will make your flower appear more organic and realistic., Thread your needle and tie a knot at the bottom of the thread. Push the needle through the center of all of the petals, starting from the bottom flower. Once the needle comes out of the top petal, push it back through the petals again and tie a knot at the bottom.

, You can either sew it on or glue it on. Fabric glue or hot glue would be the best.

, This will make the flower more stable. The felt circle should be large enough to give the flower support, but small enough so that you can't see it when you look down on top of the flower.Try to choose a color of felt that closely matches the color of your flower.

, Thread your needle and tie a knot at the end. Pick up a petal, and make a running stitch along the cut edges; do not sew along the folded edge. Start at one corner, right next to the fold, and work your way around to the other side.

, Once you have reached the other end of the triangle, slide the triangle down the thread, all the way to the knot. Keep pushing down until the fabric gathers.


If you want, you can tie a knot to keep the petal together.

, Keep stringing your petals onto the thread using a running stitch. Push the petals down to the bottom of your thread to gather them.

, Bring the first and last petals together and stitch them together. Tie the thread off into a tight knot. You should end up with what looks like a ring with gathered petals.

, Make sure that the button is large enough to cover the hole. Draw a line of hot glue around the gathered edges of the petals. Press a button into the glue.


You can also use a large beak or clunky, plastic rhinestone.

Clear elastic thread comes in many different thicknesses. Thicker elastic is sturdy, which makes it suitable for large beads. Thinner elastic is more delicate, and looks best paired with smaller beads.Elastic cords have a thread or fabric covering. They are thick by beading standards, and usually come in black and white.;
, Beading wire cannot be tied like elastic, and must be used with crimps and clasps. The crimps help hold the bracelet together. Be sure to use beading wire, which is flexible. Wire used for wire wrapping is too stiff and thick; it is not suitable for beading. To learn how to make a beaded bracelet with a clasp, click here.


Consider using memory wire for a fun, spiral bracelet.

, Smaller beads will work well on thin, delicate elastic. Large beads, however, will need something heavier, such as a thicker elastic or wire. You will also need to add extra length to your bracelet if you are using bulky beads. These beads fill up the space between the bracelet and your wrist, making the bracelet fit tighter.

, There are many different types of beads. Each material has a specific look, and some types of beads are more suitable to certain projects than others. Here are the most common beads you will find in bead shop or an arts and crafts store:


Plastic beads are the least expensive and come in many different shapes and colors. They are ideal for kids' arts and crafts. For a fun, kid-friendly bracelet, try using elastic cord in a bright color, and using plastic pony beads. You can also use alphabet beads so the kids can spell their names on the bracelet.
Glass beads are beautiful, and come in many different colors. They capture the light well and had a mid-price range. Most glass beads will be translucent, and some will have designs.
Semi-precious stones tend to be more expensive than glass beads. They also tend to be heavier. Because they are made from natural materials, no two beads are alike.
You can also find beads made from natural material, such as shell, wood, ivory, and coral. These tend to be expensive and unique; no two beads are the same.

, When buying beads, you may find that the beads are already strung for you. This is simply another way of packaging them, and is not suggestive of a final design. Simply snip the beads off their string and arrange them in a new pattern on your desk or bead tray. Here are some ideas for a design:


Put the largest beads towards the center, and the smallest beads towards the clasps.
Alternate large beads with smaller/spacer beads.
Use a warm (red, orange, yellow) or a cool (green, blue, and purple) color scheme.
Choose a bunch of beads that are all the same color, but in different sizes and shades. For example, you could use light blue, medium blue, and dark blue beads.

, You can find them in bead shops or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. They usually come in gray, and have a velvety texture. They have necklace-shaped groves with measurements. This allows beaders to lay out their pattern and see what their necklace or bracelet may look like before they put the beads on the string.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure your wrist and cut the elastic a little bit longer.,
Stretch the elastic.,
Fold some tape over one of the ends of the elastic.,
Put the beads onto the elastic.,
Keep adding beads until you have the length you want.,
Take the tape or clip off, and tie a square/surgeon knot.,
Try to slide the knot under one of the adjacent beads.,
Wait for the glue to dry before wearing your bracelet.",How to Make a Beaded Bracelet2," Stretchy bracelets are the easiest to make, and require the fewest tools. You can make a simple, child-friendly one using elastic cord and plastic pony beads. You can also make a dainty one using clear elastic and glass beads. Here is a list of what you will need:


Beading elastic or cord.
Beads
Scissors
Tape or binder clip
Super glue

, Take the beading elastic and wrap it one and a half times around your wrist. Cut it with a pair of sharp scissors. You are making it slightly larger so that you can knot it later.

, Hold the elastic between your fingers and stretch it gently. This will prevent the elastic from stretching out later on and creating gaps., This will prevent the beads from sliding off while you work. If you do not have any tape, or if the tape won't stick, use a binder clip instead.

, You do not need a needle for this; most elastic is stiff enough that you can put the bead directly onto the string. Hold the elastic close to the end, and slip the beads on.


Try to put the bead with the largest hole on first. Once you finish the bracelet, you can hide the knot by sliding it under that bead.

, Be sure to wrap the bracelet round your wrist from time to time. The first and last bead should be touching, and the bracelet should be somewhat loose. You do not want it to stretch around your wrist. If you see any gaps or cord, you will need more beads.

, Start by folding the two ends of the elastic over and under each other, like tying a pair of shoes. Tie another knot like it but don't tighten it yet; you will have something that looks like a ring. Wrap one of the tail ends around one side of the circle. Do the same thing for the other side. Now you can tighten the knot., This will determine how you finish off the bracelet. Be sure to have a bottle of super glue ready.


If you can slide the knot under one of the beads, trim off the extra string and put a drop of glue over the knot. Slide the knot under the bead.
If you can't fit the knot under one of the beads, tuck the tail ends inside the beads instead. Put a drop of glue on top of the knot to seal it.

, If you try to put the bracelet on too soon, the knot may loosen and the glue may crack. Most glues will dry in about 15 minutes, and cure after 24 hours; refer to the label for more exact drying times.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure your wrist with a measuring tape and add 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).,
Use wire cutters and cut some beading wire according to that length.,
Wrap some tape around one of the ends of the wire.,
Consider laying out your design on a beading tray.,
Put the beads onto the wire.,
Finish off by putting on a crimp bead, a lard seed bead, and one part of the clasp.,
Thread wire back through seed bead and crimp, making a loop.,
Gently slide the crimp and seed bead towards the clasp.,
Use a pair of needle nose pliers to pinch the crimp bead.,
Turn the bracelet upside down and tuck the tail into the beads.,
Repeat the process for the other end of the wire, but don't pinch the crimp yet.,
Try the bracelet on and make any adjustments, if necessary.,
Pinch the crimp bead with a pair of needle nose pliers and tug gently to test the tension.,
Thread the tail through two to three beads and snip off any excess wire.",How to Make a Beaded Bracelet3," Clasped bracelets are more advanced than stretchy bracelets. You will need additional tools and supplies in order to finish one. Here is a list of what you will need:


Beading wire
Clasp and hook
2 crimp beads
2 seed beads
Beads
Wire cutters
Needle nose pliers
Tape or binder clip

, You are making the bracelet longer so that you can finish it. You also want the bracelet to be somewhat loose, or it won't be very comfortable. Lastly, you are adding extra length because some beads add more bulk than others., You want to use a soft, flexible wire. Do not the stiff kind meant for wire wrapping. You can find beading wire in a bead shop or in the beading section of an arts and crafts store. It usually comes on a flat, disk-shaped spool.

, You are doing this so that you can string the beads on without losing any. If you don't have any tape, you can use a binder clip instead.

, If you do not have a beading tray, lay your pattern down on a table, right next to the measuring tape. This will allow you to determine how many beads you will need for your design. If you are doing a simple design (such as two altering colors) or a random design, you do not need to do this.

, Once you have decided on your pattern, start putting the beads onto the wire. You do not need a needle for this. Simply hold the wire close to the end, and start popping the beads on. Be sure to measure against your wrist from time to time; large beads will add bulk, so you may need to make the bracelet longer to make it fit.

, Once you have all of the beads on the wire, put on a crimp bead, then a seed bead, and finally a clasp. It does not matter which part of the clasp you put on first.


You can use any type of clasp. A spring or lobster-claw clasp is the most traditional, but a magnetic one may make the bracelet easier to take on and off.

, The clasp should be hanging off of the top of the loop.

, You want them to be snug, but still loose enough so that the clasp can still wiggle. Leave about an inch (2.54 centimeters) long tail on the wire.

, Be sure to pinch the bead tightly. The crimp is your ""knot,"" so it needs to be secure. Gently tug on the wire. If it moves, pinch the crimp bead tighter. Do not trim the tail off.

, The beads will slide down towards the crimp and clasp. Tuck the tail into those first few beads, hiding it. Take off the tape or binder clip from before.

, Put on a crimp bead, a seed bead, and the other part of the clasp. Thread the wire back through the seed bead and crimp. Gently tug on the tail until the beads are flush with the clasp.

, If the bracelet is too big, you will need to take off a few beads. If the bracelet is too small, you will need to add some more beads. To do this, simply pull the clasp, seed bead, and crimp off, and then make the adjustments. Be sure to replace the crimp, seed bead, and clasp once everything fits.

, If you see things shifting a little, simply pinch the crimp harder.

, Press the flat side of the wire cutters against the bead and carefully snip off the read of the tail.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure your wrist and add ¼ to 1 inch (0.64 to 2.54 centimeters).,
Cut two pieces of thread that are twice the length of your measurement.,
Hold the two threads together, fold them in half, and tie a large knot near the top of the loop.,
Place a drop of super glue onto the knot and fold a bead tip over it.,
Put all four strands of the thread through a beading needle and start stringing your beads.,
Take the needle off the thread and tie a few knots close to the last bead.,
Place a drop of glue onto the knots and fold a bead tip over them.,
Repeat this process to create as many strands as you want.,
Open two jump rings using a pair of needle nose pliers.,
Put one part of the clasp and the beaded strands onto one jump ring.,
Close the jump ring.,
Repeat the process for the other clasp and the other end of the beaded strands.",How to Make a Beaded Bracelet4," Multi-strand bracelets are fun to make. You make all strands using the same type of bead, but in different colors. You can also make each strand using a different type of bead. Seed beads are great for this type of bracelet. Here is a list of what you will need:


Beading thread
Beading needle
Beads
Bead tips (also called bead clamps, clam shells, bead ends, or string tips)
2 jump rings
Clasp and hook
Needle nose pliers
Scissors
Super glue

, This will allow the bracelet to hang loosely around your wrist. This will give you the length of your finished bead strands.

, You will be folding them in half in a later step. This will make one beaded strand.

, You will want about two to four knots. Don't worry if they look messy; you will be hiding them. You should end up with a large knot and four strands of thread coming out of it. This will make the bracelet more durable. , You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop on the bead tip should be on the same side as the short, extra ends of your thread.You will trim them off later.

, Keep stringing until the bracelet is a little bit shorter than you want it to be.

, Don't tie the knot too close, however, or you will put too much pressure on the thread. Try to leave a small gap between the knot and bead.

, You can use your fingertips or a pair of needle nose pliers to close the bead tip. The loop of the bead tip should be facing away from the beads.

, When you finish all of your strands, lay them out side by side in an order that you find visually pleasing.


If you'd prefer a ""tangled"" look to your finished bracelet, interweave your strands rather than keeping them separate.

, Hold a jump ring with your fingers and a pair of needle nose pliers. The cut part of the jump ring should be between your fingers and the pliers. Hold the ring tightly with the pliers, then move your fingers away from you. The jump ring will twist open.Repeat this step for the other jump ring.

, Hold the jump ring with the needle nose pliers, and slip the clasp and beaded strands onto the ring. Only one end of the beaded strands should be on the jump ring. The other ends of the strands should be hanging freely.

, Still holding the jump ring with the pliers, take hold of the ring with your fingers. Move your hand towards you, twisting the ring close.

, Slip the clasp onto the other jump ring, along with the strands. Close the jump ring.

Cut 3 equal sized strands of thread.,
Tie a knot near the end of the strands.,
Make a forward know with the outermost strand on the left.,
Make a forward knot around the next string.,
Repeat the forward knotting process with the pink string.,
Repeat the forward knotting process with the blue string.,
Repeat.,
Tie the ends in place when you finish.",How to Make Bracelets out of Thread1," If you want to make a very basic design, you can use three strands of thread. In this example, we're using violet, pink and blue. You may want to make a more elaborate design later on, but this pattern will teach some of the basics of knotting.


Cut out the strands to the length you wish. Keep in mind, as you'll be knotting during the process, the original length of of your threads will be shorter than the final product.
Lie your threads out side-by-side on a flat surface to start.;
, To begin, you'll need to tie a knot near the end of your stands of thread. These will connect the strands together. Tie your knot roughly two centimeters away from the ends of the threads.


As you move forward, you'll have to use specialized types of knots. However, at this point that is not necessary. Just use a basic knot, like a knot you'd use when tying your shoes. Just make sure your knot is tight enough. If it comes undone, your bracelet could unravel.

, Take the outermost strand on the left. In our example, this is the violet thread. Use this thread to make what is known as a forward knot.


To make a forward knot, take your violet thread and bend it at roughly a 90 degree angle, laying it over the pink thread. This should look something like the number four.Then, loop the violet thread under the pink thread, moving upward towards the knot connecting all the threads together. Pull upwards. Then, repeat the process. It's very important you knot twice using forward knots. If you don't knot twice, your bracelet will have too much slack., Continue working with the violet string. Use this string to make a forward knot around the last string in your row. In our example, this is the blue string. Follow the same process you did before, making sure to remember to double knot and tighten the string.

, Once you've made a row with the violet string, repeat this process with the pink string. The pink string will now be the outermost layer of your bracelet, followed by the blue string. Make a forward knot, looping the pink string over the blue string. Then, make a forward knot by looping the pink string over the violet string.

, The blue string will now have taken its place as the outermost string. Make a forward knot around the violet string. Then, make a forward knot around the pink string.

, Now, the violet string will be the outermost string again. Repeat this process, making forward knots with the violet string, followed by the pink string, followed by the blue string.


You can continue knotting until your bracelet is as long as you want. This depends on your needs, wrist size, and other factors.
A bracelet that is too short may not fit. However, a bracelet that's too long may slip off. Pause on occasion while working to wrap what you have around your wrist. Stop when you reach a point where the bracelet can be slipped on and off easily, but remains in place.

, When you reach your desired length, tie the remaining loose threads together in a knot. As with the knot you made at the beginning, just use a basic knot to do so. Then, pull the remaining strings through the loop on the other end of the bracelet. Tie the strings around the loop, forming a circular bracelet.

Gather the necessary supplies.,
Cut the embroidery thread.,
Arrange the strands in a mirror image pattern.,
Start with a forward knot on your left side.,
Continue knotting the outermost color towards the middle.,
Repeat on the right with backwards knots.,
Tie a backwards knot to connect the two middle strands.,
Repeat the process with the next outermost color.,
Braid the last bit of tread together.",How to Make Bracelets out of Thread2," You can make a basic striped bracelet using 6 strands of embroidery thread. You will use some of the methods outlined in the basic thread bracelet above to make a more elaborate design. To begin, gather your supplies.


You'll need either a safety pin or tape to secure the thread while you're working.You'll also need scissors for cutting the thread.You'll need embroidery thread, which you can buy at a craft store. Pick six different colors you like., Once you have your supplies together, you'll be able to begin the process. First, you have to cut the embroidery thread.


Cut 12 strands of thread in your different colors. Strands should be about 24 inches (61 cm) each. Make sure you have 2 sets of each of the six colors you chose.Combine the thread by tying a knot towards the end of the strands, leaving at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of slack. You'll need these 3 inches (7.6 cm) later when you're finishing up your bracelet.In order to work with your thread, you'll need to secure it. There are two ways you can do this. You can tape the knot to a flat surface, like a table. You can also use a safety pin to pin the knot down on a pillow., Now you have to arrange your threads. You'll have to do so in a way that creates a mirror image. This helps create the stripe design.


Separate your threads, placing six strands of the different colors on each side. Then, move them in such a way that the colors mirror each other.If this is confusing, look at this example. On your left side, moving from the outermost thread to the innermost thread, you have red, then orange, then lavender, then green, then yellow, then blue. On your right side, the innermost thread would be blue. Blue would be followed by yellow, then green, then lavender, then orange, and ending on a red thread., To begin, you would start with the outermost thread on your left side. In the example above, that would be the red thread. You would take the red thread and make a forward knot over the second outermost color. In our example, the second outermost color is orange. If you do not remember how to make a forward knot, see Step 3 of Method 1.

, Using your outermost thread, move inward. Continue to make forward knots over each color until you reach the thread in the middle. In our example, this would be the blue thread. Make sure to remember to knot twice when making forward knots., Once you're finished with the left side, you can move to the outermost thread on the right. The process is mostly the same. You're moving the outermost color inwards towards the middle thread. However, you'll be using what are called backwards knots instead of forward knots.


Once again, you'll lay the outermost thread on top of the thread next to it. In our example, this means placing the red thread on the right over the orange thread on the right.Loop the red thread under the orange thread. This time, move downward when you loop the thread, moving away from the knot holding your strands of thread together. Pull tight into a knot. As with a forward knot, knot twice.As you did on the left side, continue moving inward with your outermost thread. Make two backwards knots with each color on the right side until you reach the innermost thread. In our example, this would be the blue thread.

, In the middle, you'll have two stands of the same color. In our example, there are two blue strands in the middle. Once you've finished knotting the left and right side, tie these middle strands together. Use a backwards knot, outlined above, to do so., After you've knotted the first outermost color, a new thread should emerge as the outermost color on each side. In our example, orange would become the new outermost color. Repeat the above process with the orange thread.


Start on the left side. Use forward knots, remembering to knot twice, to tie the orange thread with all the other colors.
On the right side, use the orange thread to tie backwards knots with all the other colors. Remember to knot twice.
When you reach the center, tie the two innermost strands of thread together using a backwards knot.
Repeat this process until you've knotted all the strands of thread together. You should have a nice, simple striped pattern by the end of the process., When you're done merging all the threads, tie a tight knot on the end of the bracelet. Braid the remaining strands together. Remove the tape or the pin from the other end. Braid these strands together as well. You've made a simple, striped pattern bracelet out of thread."

Get the supplies together.,
Cut your thread.,
Tie the threads together in a loop.,
Tie your knots.,
Change colors as you wish.,
Tie the final knot.",How to Make Bracelets out of Thread3," A knotted bracelet can be a fun and simple design to try. To begin, you'll need some basic supplies. You'll need three different colors of embroidery thread, a safety pin, and a pair of scissors., Once you have you supplies together, you can cut your thread. Cut a strand of each color. Your strands should be fairly large. Each strand should be 2 to 3 arm lengths long., Once your strings are cut, you'll need to gather your strings together and tie them into a loop. This process can be somewhat tricky so go slowly and follow instructions carefully.


Gather all your strings together. You can lie them down side-by-side on a long table or on the floor. Find the midpoint of all three strings. Fold all the strings in half along the midpoint.Towards the end of your folded strings, tie them together in a tight knot to secure. This will make a small loop on the end of your stands of strings. Use a basic knot here, like you'd use when tying your shoes.
You'll use the loop you create when your finish your bracelet. You will end up slipping your strings through the loop and tying them together. Make sure the loop is big enough to fit three threads through.Slip a safety pin through the loop. Fasten the loop on a pillow or other firm surface. This will keep the threads organized and secure while you work., Once all is set up, you can begin the knotting process. For this type of bracelet, you simply repeat the following process until the bracelet is as long as you want.


Use one hand to gather two strings on the right.
Use your other hand to create a loop with the string to the left. Lie the left thread over the two threads on the right, creating a circular loop with the slack from the left thread. It should look something like a backwards ""P.""
Slip the left string under your two right strings. Move it through the loop you created, moving upward towards the knot on the top.Pull the left string, holding the other two strings loosely. You should be able to pull upward until the knot you created reaches the knot connecting the threads.Repeat this process until all your threads are knotted together.

, The knots will take on the color of the string to the left. If you want to change colors, return the left string to other two strings. Then, pull a string of a different color out of the bunch, moving it to the left side. Repeat the knotting process with that string.


How and when you change colors depends on your personal preferences. If you want a bracelet with a more random design, change colors whenever you feel like it. If you want a more uniform design, make a rule for yourself. For example, you'll change color every 5 knots., When you reach the end of your bracelet, you'll need to tie an end knot. How long you make your bracelet is up to you. However, make sure you have at least a few inches of thread at the end. Simply tie a knot using all three strings, as you did when making the loop at the beginning.


Remove the bracelet from the safety pin. Pull the excess strings through the loop at the top. Then, tie a knot with the excess strings to create a fully formed bracelet.For this part of the process, you can simply use basic knots, like you would use to tie your shoes.

, Tie all your strings in a small knot at the very end. Then, braid them for about three inches and tie them in a second knot. You have just created one of the ends that will be tied around your wrist. Tape or pin this knot to a tabletop or your pant leg.








, Lay your strings out flat, leaving a bit of space between each piece. Start on the left side and tie basic knots across each string by laying your first string in an “L” shape over the string directly to the right. This should create a “4” shape. Take the end of this string and loop it underneath the string to the right, pulling the end through the center. This should create a loop around the 2nd string, which you should pull taut to the top of the strings. Repeat steps to finish the knot.








, Using the same string that you started with, work your way to the right side of the strings by tying knots around each of the adjacent threads. When you get to the right side (after tying knots over all the strings), let the thread go and start again on the left side. Continue the same pattern you started by starting with the 2nd thread, working until you get to the right side. Eventually you will work your way across all the strings with all four of your threads, and start the pattern over again with the original 1st thread. Make sure to keep pulling the threads taut to the top of the bracelet, so that your finished product is sleek, smooth, and flat.








, Stop your weaving pattern of the bracelet when the the striped section is long enough to wrap around your wrist. Tie a knot at the end, and then braid a 3” section of string past the knot. Knot the end of this braid to create the second tie for your bracelet.

The bracelet base will be created using the “striped bracelet” method and the polka dots will be sewn on afterwards.








, Cut your string into four pieces measuring 24” long. Tie these in a knot at the end, and then braid a section 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) long to act as one tie for the bracelet. Make a second knot at the end of the braid, and then tape or pin the strings to a table or your pant leg.








, Lay your strings out flat, leaving a bit of space between each piece. Start on the left side and tie basic knots across each string by laying your first string in an “L” shape over the string directly to the right. This should create a “4” shape. Take the end of this string and loop it underneath the string to the right, pulling the end through the center. This should create a loop around the 2nd string, which you should pull taut to the top of the strings. Repeat steps to finish the knot.








, The string you started with should now be on the right hand side. Take the second string and repeat the same pattern that you started with the first. Create a “4” shape on the string to its right, thread the end through the center, and pull the string taut to the base. Do this with the second string all the way across the remaining strings until there are none left. Continue the pattern by rotating the strings from the left to the right by tying knots.









Keep the pattern up until the bracelet has reached a length long enough to wrap around your wrist. Then, tie a knot and braid 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of the remaining string before tying and additional knot and cutting off the excess string.














, To give your bracelet polka dots, you will be using the French knot style from embroidery. Thread a needle with the color of string you’ve chosen for your polka dots. Tie a knot at the base, and pull it up through the bottom of the bracelet where you would like your first knot to be.









Pull the thread all the way through, and then bring the needle back to the base of the string. Wrap the needle around the string (as it is being held taut) so that it spirals around the needle 3 times.













Place the needle at a point in your bracelet very near the origin of your thread, but don’t pull it through. Then, pull the spiral of string tight to the bottom of the needle and pinch it above the fabric while pulling the needle all the way through. Finish the knot by tying it off on the underside of the bracelet. Add as many polka dot knots as you would like.

, Spread the strings out so that each of the two colors are lined up opposite each other in a mirror image. Then, take the string on the far left and fold it in half over the string directly to its right. The two strings should create a “4” shape; take the end from the first string and wrap it through the center of the “4” and pull the string upwards, creating a knot. Do this again on the same string so that you create two consecutive knots.








, Continue the pattern of tying double knots using a “4” shape across all the strings on the left until the first string has reached the center of the group.








, Take the string on the far right side; it should be the same color as the string you just brought to the center. Create a backwards “4” shape and tie double knots with it until you reach the middle of the bracelet, next to its pair. Then, tie the two strings in the middle together in a double knot.








, Work from the left to the center and then the right to the center using the same process as explained above. When a pair of strings the same color met in the middle, double knot them (otherwise you’ll end up with two separate striped bracelets).








, When you have added as much length as you need to wrap the chevron section of bracelet around your wrist, tie the remaining strings together in a knot. Then, add 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) of braid to the end to create a secure end to tie the bracelet off with. Cut off any loose ends, and sport your new chevron bracelet on your own wrist or gift it to a friend!

Intertwine two cords around the foundation.,

Buy a premade paracord bracelet.If you're pressed for time and aren't into crafts projects, you can buy the bracelets in an already-made form professionally.",How to Make a King Cobra Paracord Bracelet," The amount of paracord you'll need depends on the size you want your bracelet to be. It's a good idea to put one foot of cord aside for every inch of bracelet.Measure your wrist with measuring tape and gauge how much you think you'll need based on that.


Paracord can be purchased relatively cheaply from a wholesale outlet. You can get 50 feet of it for as little as 3.99 USD.This roughly equals to about $1 per bracelet.
There are different gauges of paracord. The most reliable and recommended of these is Paracord 550, a military-certified grade that supports up to 550 pounds of weight.;
, It helps to measure out this paracord to make sure it will fit relatively well around your wrist. Keep in mind, however, that upgrading to a king cobra bracelet will make the bracelet a lot bigger. You should make sure you leave some room in between the bracelet and your wrist for the extra rope.

, If you include a bucket device on either end of your cord, you'll be able to attach it to your wrist and deploy it comfortably.

, A lot of your bracelet making will be spent alternating between tying two cords around the foundation of your work. Pull two separate cords through the top loop of your foundation, and entwine them down the length of the cord. Wrap one around one end of it, and take the cord from the opposing side and do the same. Alternate between the two as if you were lacing a shoe.


Each opposing cord should make a loop shape for the other one to go through. This will result in a sequence of knots going down the length of the foundation.
It's a good idea (but not necessary) to make the two cords different colours. Not only does this add a visual flair to your bracelet, you'll be able to identify more easily if you slip up in the knotting process.

, The tighter you pull the knots in place, the more rigid it will be. A certain level of rigidity is wanted in bracelets, but flexibility will allow it to hug the shape of your wrist. A fine balance between the two is often best.


After making a few coils, feel the bracelet so far for a basic idea how your current knot tightness is affecting the flexibility.

, To do this, simply take a lighter to the ends and melt them. This will create a makeshift finish to the cords. If you've coiled the cords tightly enough around the foundation, there shouldn't be any risk of it coming apart.


After melting the lighter, you should press on the end with the flat end of a wet knife. This will prevent the ends from fraying., A basic cobra bracelet is easy to make, but it doesn't leave a lot of paracord for you to use in survival situations. A king cobra bracelet is built on the foundations of a regular bracelet. You should make sure your basic bracelet is in solid shape before moving on with the king cobra.


Supplies for a king cobra are roughly double that of a regular cobra bracelet. For example, if you had a 9 inch bracelet using 9 feet of cord, you'll need 18 feet for your king cobra., Making a king cobra bracelet is arguably easier than the basic cobra as your knots will have more room to link around. Wrap a cord around and tie it off at one end. Pull it diagonally downward and make another knot. Continue these basic steps until you've coiled your new cords around the span of the basic cobra bracelet.


It's a good idea not to make these knots too tight. That way, you'll still be able to unfurl them without too much hassle if it comes time to use it.

, The King Cobra paracords will be what defines the look of your bracelet. For the sake of adding beauty to your bracelet, you should use more than one colour. When you intertwine the cords together, it will result in an elaborate pattern.

, Although the regular cobra cords are often made a permanent part of the bracelet, a king cobra bracelet is meant to be unfurled. Cut off whatever excess length you have with a knife or some scissors. Melt the ends with a lighter to prevent them from fraying, and cool the molten edges with a wet knife.

, Although some may prefer to keep their paracord bracelets simply for show, a king cobra bracelet is essentially made for survival use. The king cobra layer of your work can be uncoiled and used however you'd like. Hunting, fishing, camping and climbing are but a few of the uses you may have for it.


Alternatively, you can leave it for decoration's sake if you want. Paracord bracelets are good because of their practical uses, but some people prefer to leave it as a clothing accessory.

, Outlets like Gorilla Paracord specialize in paracord-related survival gear.


There's a paracord community on eBay as well. You might try looking for an all-encompassing paracord kit."

, Lay out all three threads evenly. Grab the middle of the bunch (make sure it's the middle by seeing if the bottom threads line up). Pinch the threads about two inches down from the center point with your other hand, so that the bundle looks like one thread. Make a loop with the bundle, then pull the rounded center of the bundle through the center. You should have a small loop of thread above the knot, and six threads coming down from the knot.

, Use masking tape to attach the small threads coming out of the knot to a table or counter, or put a safety pin through the knot and attach it to the top of your jeans (while sitting down). A secured knot will help you maintain consistent tension.

, Separate your threads into two even groups, with three threads on each side. Take the threads on the right (pink in the photos) and loop them over and under the threads on the left (blue). Then put the pink threads through the loop you just created around the blue threads. Pull horizontal pink string and blue string keeping them parallel to your knee or the table, and vertically on the pink threads, keeping them perpendicular to your knee or the table.

, Lay out all four threads evenly. Grab the middle of the bunch (make sure it's the middle by seeing if the bottom threads line up). Pinch the threads about two inches down from the center point with your other hand, so that the bundle looks like one thread. Make a loop with the bundle, then pull the rounded center of the bundle through the center. You should have a small loop of thread above the knot, and eight threads coming down from the knot.

, For this design, the thread colors will need to be in a certain pattern before you start. Alternate them so that the first and second colors run 1212 2121 across. Your two middle threads should be the same color; your two outside threads should be the same color, and the opposite color of the middle threads.

, For this pattern, you'll need to know the difference between a forward and a backward knot. Basically, a forward knot is when you use a thread to tie a cross knot on a thread to the right. A backward knot is when you use a thread to tie a cross knot on a thread to the left.


Starting with the thread on the far right, tie three backward knots. Take the thread on the far right, and loop it over and under the thread next to it on the left. Pull the end of the far-right thread through the loop. Then pull the far-right thread vertically, or perpendicular to your leg or the table, while pulling the second-right thread horizontally, or parallel to your leg or the table. The thread that was on the far right will now be second to the right. Using this same thread, tie backward knots on the next two threads. Stop when the thread that was on the far right is in the middle, with three threads to the right of it.
Starting with the thread on the far left, tie three forward knots. Take the thread on the far left, and loop it over and under the thread next to it on the right. Pull the end of the far-left thread through the loop. Then pull the far-left thread vertically, or perpendicular to your leg or the table, while pulling the second-left thread horizontally, or parallel to your leg or the table. The thread that was on the far left will now be second to the left. Using this same thread, tie forward knots on the next two threads. Stop when the thread that was on the far left is in the middle, with three threads to the left of it. Your color pattern should now be 2121 1212.

, The second round will be just like the first, only with the opposite colors. Start on the right and tie three backward knots; then tie three forward knots starting on the left. Your color pattern at the end will be back to 1212 2121.

, With the thread that's second to the right, tie a forward knot over the far-right strand. With the thread that's second to the left, tie a backward knot over the far-left strand. Your color pattern should now be 2112 2112.

, With the thread that's now second to the right, tie two backward knots over the two strands to the left. With the thread that's now the second to the left, tie two forward knots over the two strands to the right. Your color pattern should now be 2121 1212.

, With the thread that's now second to the right, tie a forward knot over the far-right thread. With the thread that's now second to the left, tie a backward knot over the far-left thread. The color pattern is now 1221 1221.

, With the thread that's second to the right, make two backward knots over the two threads to the left. With the thread that's second to the left, make two forward knots over the two threads to the right. You should be able to see the heart pattern clearly now. Your color pattern after this step should be 1212 2121.

, Keep tying until you have about a 2-inch (5 cm) tail of untied thread or have finished the heart closest to that length. Separate the threads into two groups of four, on the right and left, and braid into two tails. (To braid with four strands, simply hold two threads together and treat it like one strand when braiding.) Tie off each braid with an overhand knot about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) away from the end.

, Draw one of the braids you just finished through the loop above your top knot, then tie it to the other braid in a double knot. Your friend should be able to remove it at the end of the day with one hand.

You'll need at least six strands of string (two strands of three colors), but you can use any even number of strands.


The more strings you use, the more complex your color arrangements will be and the wider the width of your bracelet.
Use whatever colors you want; just make sure that you have two strands of each single color that you choose.;
, Tie a knot at the end of the strands of string and secure it in any number of ways to make it easier to hold steady while you finish the bracelet.


You can clip it to your clipboard, safety pin it to your pants or a pillow, or tape it to your work surface. You can also use a binder clip with a binder or book. Alternatively, you can just tie it to a drawer handle.

, Using the thread, make a mirror-image pattern so that the two outside strands are the same color and so on going inwards.


Pretend there is an imaginary line in the middle and create the same color pattern with the string on both sides of the line.

, Starting with the outer-right string, tie a right knot twice on the adjacent string (the second from the right).









To tie a right knot, make a ninety degree angle with the tying string over the top of the string you are tying it to. Then loop the tying string underneath the other string and pull tight.
Note: Remember to make two knots on each string.
Once you have knotted the outer right string to the one next to it, do the same to the next string closer to the middle. Continue this process until you've reached the middle.
Note: The string you began tying with (the outermost right string) should now be in the middle.

, From the left side, tie left knots with the outer-left strand until you reach the middle.









To tie a left knot, do the same as the right knot but reversed. Make a ninety degree angle with the tying string over the top of the string you are tying it to and loop the tying string under the other string and pull it tight.

, Tie a left or right knot (doesn't matter) with the two middle strands to connect the two sides (be sure to tie the knot twice).









Note: If you have done everything correctly up to this point, the strands you are tying together in the middle will be the same color and you will begin to see the V-pattern emerge.

, Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6 until you reach the desired length, always starting with the outermost strands on each side. These strands should always be the same color.








, Tie a knot at the end of the pattern and use the excess string to tie the bracelet onto your wrist or the wrist of a friend.


Alternatively, you can create a button-loop closure for the bracelet. Attach a button to one side by pulling any two strands through the holes in the button. Then, tie the strands together and cut off the excess of all strands (even the ones not used for the button). On the other end of the bracelet, there should already be a loop that exists between the knot at the end and the place where the knots begin. Pull the button through the loop once you have finished all the steps.

, Fold the piece of cord in half.

, Wrap the folded cord around your wrist. Measure the cord by taking the ends through the loop created by the fold. Make a clasp by creating an overhand knot where the bracelet should meet. Essentially, it will be a ball and loop closure with the knot acting as the ball.


To make an overhand knot, take the ends together in your hand. Cross it over itself in the front, making a loop. Push the ends through the loop in the back, bringing them forward. Tighten the loop to form the knot.
Cut off the ends. You should now have a length of folded-over cord as long as your wrist with a knot on one end.

, Place the fold end of the bracelet cord up. Take the other length of cord. Place the middle of it behind the fold, about an inch from the top.

, Pull the right cord over the middle section. Pull the end back to the right, creating a single loop over to the left.

, Pull the left cord over the top of the loop. Weave it under the middle section. You should also have a small loop on the right. Pull the left cord up through it and over it.

, Pull the ends to tighten the knot.

, Pull the left cord over the middle. Pull the end back, creating a loop on the right side (and a smaller loop above it on the left side).

, Loop the right side over the top of the loop, then under the middle cord. Weave it up through the loop on the left side, going over the cord.

Measure the head of the person who will be wearing the headband from the nape of the neck, up over their head where the headband will be and completing the loop back at the nape. If the person is unavailable to be measured, you can use these general guidelines:Preemie: 11”-12”
Newborn: 13”
Up to 1: 14”
1-6: 15”
7-Teen: 16.5”
Adult: 17.5”
Especially with babies, be sure to get a good fit that is not too tight. Constricting an infant's head could have a problematic effect on its growth and development.;
, Choose a fold-over elastic. This is the preferred elastic for headbands. It is available in a variety of colors and patterns at your local fabric store or hobby shop. Fold-over elastic has a finished, shiny side and a matte underside, and a seam running longways down the middle.This elastic comes in 1/8”, 3/8” and 5/8” widths. The one most commonly use for headbands is 3/8"", but some like a thin 1/8"" headband, especially for babies.
Some elastic is made with silicone strips in the back. This is useful if you are concerned about the headband slipping.

, Measure the piece of elastic according to the measurements you took or the average length for the age of person you are creating the headband for. If you are using actual head measurements, keep in mind that you want the headband to stretch. Subtract one inch from the head size to make sure the headband will be snug., If the person who you are making the headband for is there, wrap the elastic around their head and make sure that the elastic stretches just enough to hold the headband in place once it is complete.


Beware of making the headband so tight that it would be uncomfortable.

, There are a couple of ways you could go about sealing the ends of the elastic. You can apply a product which was created to seal fabric, or you may choose to heat the ends. Either way, you want to be sure to seal the ends so that they won’t fray.Look for a fray-stop spray at your local fabric store and spray both ends of your elastic.
To seal the ends with heat, quickly pass the ends through a flame to singe them.

, Keeping the shiny, finished side on top, curve the elastic into a circle until the ends overlap about a quarter of an inch. Be sure not to accidentally twist the elastic when you are creating your circle. The headband should lay flat on your head., Heat a hot glue gun to a high temperature. Press the button on the glue gun to release glue and drag it across the width of the top of one end of your elastic band. Carefully place the other end on top of the glue and press the ends together. Hold this in place for a few seconds.Be careful not to burn yourself. The glue will be very hot.
Wait 30 minutes for the glue to dry completely before wearing the headband.
You can also sew the ends together. Thread a needle with a thread that matches your elastic and put a few stitches through the overlapped ends. Tie a knot to secure the stitches.

, You can find headband sliders at craft and fabric stores. These decorative pieces have metal or plastic backs which slide onto the elastic strap. Thread the strap up through the first hole in the slider, over the center piece, and back down through the second hole, then slide it onto the elastic strap.Once you secure the ends, you can put the headband on and slide the decoration into the proper place.

, Add a little glitz and glitter with pins and broaches. Once you have completed the headband, decide where you want the decoration and stick the pin through the headband and secure it in place.


Be sure to line up the pin so that it is not lopsided on the headband.

, Choose a fabric flower which is larger than the width of your headband. Cut a felt circle slightly larger than the width of your headband and smaller than the size of the flower. Cover one side of the felt with hot glue and do the same with the bottom of the flower. Place the felt piece on the underside of the headband and the flower on top of that part of the headband. Press and hold the two pieces together.It is a good idea to place this flower over the seam to cover it and give your headband a nice, clean look.
Allow 30 minutes for the glue to dry.

, Cut another small piece of elastic. The length should equal to 3 times the width of the headband. Line it up along the top of the seam and wrap one end around the bottom of the headband. Hot glue this end in place, then wrap the other end of the small piece of elastic around the headband and glue it to the first end of the small piece of elastic to finish off the loop.Now you have a hairband which can hold any decoration you have on a clip by sliding it through the loop and clipping it in place.
You can also glue flowers or other decorations to a clip if they are not already fixed to one.

","How to Make a ""Wave"" Knot Bracelet"," This will give you a total of 8 strings in all.






;
, They should be about 3 1⁄2 feet (1.1 m) long, or more. Make them longer than you need, but not by too much, as you don't want to waste the string. A good thing to remember is that it's better to have too much string than not enough.









Have some string left over, so that you are able to tie the bracelet around your wrist.
The two strings that you use to tie around are not visible in your bracelet! It's best to make them a different color from the rest, so that you can tell them apart. They also don't need to be as long.

, Put them in the order that you want to tie them in. The two strings that are to be used to tie around need to be next to each other and at one end of the bracelet. In these images, brown is being used as the tie-around strings.

Measure the head.,
Decide the dimensions.,
Choose your materials.,
Cut your material.,
Cut your elastic.",How to Make Baby Headbands1," Before you can make the headband you will need to know the appropriate size. This can be done by measuring the individual or by using generalized measurements based on age or weight. If measuring in person, you will want to measure the circumference of the head, in roughly the same place that you intend the headband to go. This will usually be just above the ears.


Methods. Babies are fragile and do not like to hold still, so taking their measurements can be challenging. If you have a cloth measuring tape, use this. Avoid metal measuring tapes as they are inaccurate and may scratch the baby. If a cloth measuring tape is unavailable, measure the head using a length of soft string and then comparing the string to another measurement tool.
If the baby is not located nearby or if the baby has not yet been born, you may have to rely on generalized measurements. These can be found readily on the internet. Try searching for standard sizes on sewing and craft websites and message boards. It may also be possible to find another child of a similar size or age and measure their head.;
, You will want to decide the appropriate width of the band. This will largely depend on the size of the baby who will wear the headband, as a too-wide band will not conform to the head and simply slip off. A newborn will likely not be able to wear a band much wider than half an inch. A six-month to one-year-old baby will probably be able to wear a one inch band. A toddler will probably be able to wear a two inch band.


You may wish to test first before deciding. This can be done by cutting scrap fabric to try to visually guess the correct width or by having your baby try store-bought bands first to find the proper size.

, The materials for the band will largely depend on the type of band you wish to make. Since babies have soft, fragile skin, stretchy and soft materials are best. Stretch jersey, velvet, or lace are best suited to infant headbands. This material should form the band itself. More options are available for embellishments, as these will not be as close-fitting to the child’s head.

, Once you have chosen your material, it will be necessary to cut it. Materials like jersey will need to be doubled over in order to form a tube. If you choose to use a fabric like stretch lace, however, doubling will be unnecessary.









For jersey, velvet and other full fabrics, you will want to cut the material in a long rectangular shape, in order to be able to eventually form a tube. First, cut the length (using the head measurement taken earlier) so that there is a quarter to half-inch seam allowance on either end. Cut the width so that it is twice the size you decided on, as well as another quarter to half-inch extra seam allowance. These seam allowances should be on all sides.
Use appropriate tools. Using sewing shears is very important when you cut the fabric, as dull blades can lead to an uneven, unattractive edge.

, Using the baby’s head measurement, cut a piece of elastic to that length. Do not shorten it to provide tension once placed on the head, as some of the length will be lost in the seam and you want to preserve as much stretch as possible. Preserving some of the stretch and tension will allow the baby to wear the band for longer, as well as helping to ensure that the band is not too tight.








"
"
Create the tube.,
Add the elastic.",How to Make Baby Headbands2," Now you will want to create the tube. This tube comprises the main section of the headband. It will go around the head and embellishments will be added to it. Make it as even as possible but since it is made of stretch fabric, most imperfections will be hidden naturally.









Fold the rectangle of fabric. If you’ve chosen to use stretch lace, this will be unnecessary. If using other materials, fold it lengthwise so that the wrong side is facing outwards.
Pin the material using straight pins, so that the long edges are in line with each other. Straight pins should be placed perpendicular to the long side of the fabric. This will keep your sewing machine from catching on a pin if you forget to remove one. It will also make it possible to sew right over the pins as well.
Sew the length of the material, leaving your quarter to half-inch seam allowance and the ends open. Use a stitch and sewing machine needle appropriate to the material you have chosen. Stretchy fabrics will require a ball-point needle and a stretch or zigzag stitch. For plain cotton a normal needle and straight stitch should suffice. The same methods can be done by hand but will be more time consuming.
Reverse the fabric. This can be done simply by hand but it may be easier to use basic tools. The most common method is to use a small safety-pin. Pin it at the end of the tub in such a way that the dead of the pin is inside the tube. Begin pulling small sections of fabric over the pin and pushing the head down the length of the tube. This takes time but is fair simple. When you are done you may wish to iron the tube flat, to create more of a band appearance. You may also wish to forgo ironing, in favor of a looser, draped look.

, The elastic will allow the headband to gently stay on your baby’s head, without constricting or requiring snaps or ties. It will also allow the band to grow with your baby, allowing her to wear it for longer. Be sure that you have enough elastic, as a too-tight band is not good for your baby.









Feed the elastic through the tube. This will be easiest if you place a safety-pin at one end of the elastic and use that to guide you. Make sure that as you pull the elastic through the tube, the elastic remains flat.
Sew the two ends of the elastic together by hand or by machine. A zigzag or x-shaped stitch is good for this. Be sure that the elastic is flat and did not twist inside the tube.
Close the tube. While it is possible to use your machine, this step works best when using hand stitching. Tuck the ends of the fabric inward as much as possible. Use careful, small whip stitches to join the ends of the tube together. If you do not want to sew by hand, close the tube with your machine, overlapping the fabric and sewing a line down the back. This method will be more visible that hand-stitching. With the tube closed, now your band is done!

Create a Bow.,
Make a flower.,
Use sequins.,
Attach shapes.",How to Make Baby Headbands3," With the band done, you will want to add decorations in order to complete the look. A bow is a classic look for young girls and is simple to create. This may be a good place to start when creating your own baby headbands.


To make a bow, you will need ribbon. Try to get fabric ribbon, as plastic ribbon is not good for this purpose. Choose a ribbon that compliments the color of the band you have just created and appeals to your personal taste.
There are several different types of bow. You can make one which is simple, like those used to tie shoes, or you can make one that is more complex, like those bought to go on presents. For the simple bow, tie a bow as normal. Take an extra inch or two of ribbon and wrap it around the center of the bow to hide the knot. Glue or sew this unto the band.
For a more complex bow, take a roll of ribbon. Holding the end down, make a loop about two inches long and then hold that down. Reverse and do the same thing on the other side. Reverse and repeat until your bow looks full. Use a single stitch to keep it in place and then cover the center as before. Glue or stitch this to the band.

, You may wish to go for a more floral look with your headband. This is a great look for little girls and will give her a fairy-like appearance. You can use one flower or glue multiple flowers together. You can use craft flowers, which look realistic, a simply glue them on or you can create your own from fabric.


Begin with foot-long, one inch wide strips of fabric. Try to use fabric which is contrasting but complementary to the band you have sewn. Any fabric type will do, including basic cottons.
Glue this fabric around a pipe cleaner in a slightly uneven way. This will give the material a draped look.
Roll the pipe cleaner into a rosette shape. If you are only using one, it may be possible to then glue the flower directly to your band. Otherwise, glue the flower or flowers into an arrangement on a piece of felt. Cut the felt to ensure that it is not visible when looking at the flowers from above and then glue the felt to the band.

, For a more fabulous look, you can use sequins. These are easy to use and do not require you to make anything extra. They come in a variety of colors and sizes and can be attached to your band to create many different patterns. Try using varying sizes of the same color to achieve a different look.


Sequins can be sew on individually by stitching through the hole at the center or they can be glued to the band. Use whatever method is suited to your skill and what you feel looks best. You may wish to practice attaching them to scrap fabric first.

, You can attach a variety of shapes to the headband as well. These can be items you have crafted yourself or they can be items purchased from a craft store. This can be a great way to let your little girl’s personality shine through. Choose items which tell people who she is. Stars, hearts, animals, or food items all make good shapes to put on the band.


You can make these shapes yourself, using felt. You can simply create the shape and cut it from one or more pieces of felt and glue that to the band, or you can use felting to create a 3D object to glue or stitch to the band. It simply depends on your skill and desire.
You can also use novelty buttons or scrapbooking decorations to embellish your headband. Glue or sew these as necessary.

Choose your school colors, or the colors of your favorite sports team.;
, 32 inches should be plenty of string for the average bracelet. If you are making it for a larger wrist or an ankle, you will want to add a few inches accordingly.


If the bracelet is for you or someone you are with, wrap the string around their wrist or ankle. Wrap it around 3-4 times, and leave a couple more inches for excess and tying.

, Holding all three strings together, make a loop 1-2 inches from the top of the strings, pull all three strings through the loop, then pull the ends to tighten the knot.

, Lay each string out, one right next to the other in the order you wish them to appear in your design. Using scotch tape, tape the string to the table just above the knot.

, Take the string you would like to use first in your left hand. Hold both of the other strings in your right hand, putting a little tension on the tape to keep these two strings straight. Pull the first string to the right, then lay it over the other two strings to create a loop which looks like a “4.” Wrap the first string under the other two and through the loop you created

, Pull the thread through the loop. Take the tail, or end, of the '4' by putting your hand in the wide space of the '4' and pull the tail. As you tie the knot, pull the two strings in one hand vertically (downward), or parallel to your table. Pull the tail of the string with which you pulled through the loop gently upward toward the top of the bracelet where it is taped to the table. The knot will rise to the top.


Make the knot tight enough that it will stay in place, but not so tight that it cinches your bracelet.
As you continue weaving, make sure that these knots lie one right after the other on your bracelet and don't overlap.

, Continue repeating this overhand loop until you have enough length of this color on your bracelet. Every five ties should make about 1/4 inch of color.


Be sure that you keep track of how many loops you put in the first color.
Use the same number of loops for each color to keep the length of each color consistent.

, Repeat this process with the next color you would like to see in your bracelet. Continue on to the last color, then go back to the first one until you have a bracelet of sufficient length.

, Once you have woven the bracelet as long as you need it, take all three strings in your hand and tie a knot by making a loop with all three and pulling the ends of the three strings through the loop.


If you want the knot to be more secure, you can tie a double knot.

, Remove the tape and take the top end of the bracelet in on hand and the bottom in the other. Tie these two ends together in a knot to complete the circle of your bracelet.


If the bracelet is for you, have someone help you tie it directly on your wrist for you. Leave it loose enough that you can get it off without untying it, but not so loose it falls off. You should be able to fit two fingers between your wrist and your bracelet.
If the bracelet is for a friend, you can tie it directly onto their wrist or ankle for the perfect fit.
You can ask your friend to measure their wrist with a flexible tape measure like you would find in a sewing kit. Add an inch to that measurement for the size of your bracelet., You don’t have to stick with just the three colors. You can make a slightly thicker bracelet with more colors and designs by adding more strings to the project.


Add more strings of different colors as you choose.
You may also want to separate the colors with some black thread, by tying three black knots between each block of color.
Braid the remaining portion of the string on both ends beyond the knot. Tie another knot at the ends of the braids.

, Take the long piece on the left, cross it over the tail of the piece from the right, and then bring it through the loop that was formed. This should create a knot around the two center strings. You will only be using the long, outer two pieces of hemp to do the knot-tying.








, Working from the right side only, continue making a loop, crossing the left string over and then under and through the loop. After a few knots you will begin to notice a spiral in your bracelet; twist it back to keep it in line as you work.








, When enough knots have been tied to create a spiral long enough to wrap around your wrist, tie a knot at the end and cut the excess pieces off. You can attach clasps to secure the bracelet to your wrist or simply tie a knot with the loose strands.

Obtain about 3m (10 feet) of paracord.,
Grab the middle of the paracord to fold it in half.








,
Wrap the looped end around your wrist to get the circumference of your wrist.,
Tie off the end.,
Double check that the bracelet will fit.,
Begin weaving the strings.,
Pass strand 2 over the loop and then under strand 1.,
Tighten the knot by pulling on the loose ends.








,
Repeat the first part of the process.,
Repeat the second part of the knot.,
Continue this process.,
Sew on your button.,
Remove the temporary tie that you added above.,
Wear the bracelet.",How to Make a Paracord Combat Bracelet," You can use a measuring tape or anything else to get it to about 3m.









If you don't have a measuring cord, use your body to approximate! When stretched out to either side, the distance between your fingertips should be approximately equal to your height. If you are close to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, cutting a cord that is about the same length as two of your arm spans will do the trick.;
,, For a tighter measurement, lace the non looped end through the looped end, so that the paracord stays around your wrist.








, Use string, yarn, or something similar to mark the circumference of your wrist on the bracelet.









If the cord or string will fit around a button or other item that you will use as a clasp, you can add it to the cord directly now. Place it at the top end, where the tie is. Alternatively, you can add this in a later step.

, You should now have a loop with 2 long strands coming off. Double check that the bracelet will fit by wrapping the looped end around your wrist. If it is too small or too big, adjust the tie that you made in the previous step.








, Pass the first of the longer strands ( Strand 1) through the loop, then over the second length of string (Strand 2).








, Strands 1 and 2 should now have switched places.








,, Begin again with strand 1. Note that this time strand 1 will be going right to left instead of left to right. Alternating the side from which you start will help the bracelet lie flat across your wrist.








, Again, strand 2 will come from the opposite side as it did in the first knot. Go over the loop and under the opposite strand.








, Stop when you have about 3 centimeter (1.2 in) left at the end of the loop. Then, cut off any excess cord.









Melt the cut ends of 1 and 2 so that they fuse with the weave. This will stop the bracelet from unraveling when you wear it.














, Sew your button on the end of the bracelet that does not have a loop. You can adjust the fit of your bracelet by changing the placement of your button.









If the bracelet seems too small, sew the button as close to the end of the bracelet as possible. If it seems too big, sew the button further in on the bracelet.
Be sure you test the size of your button before you sew it on. If it is small enough to fit through the loop on the bracelet without any help, you'll need a bigger button. Likewise, if the button cannot fit through the loop at all, you will not be able to put the bracelet on.

, If you cannot untie it, feel free to cut it instead.








, Wrap the bracelet around your wrist and fasten it by slipping the button through the loop.

Select suitable fabric.The fabric needs to be easily pliable so that it can wind around the rings and sit flat.,
Find some curtain rings.,
Tear or cut the fabric into ribbon strips.,
Wrap each strip around the ring.,
Leave to dry.

,
Assemble the bracelet.",How to Make a Curtain Ring and Fabric Bracelet," Avoid stiff materials or starched fabric. Ideal materials would include: cotton prints, lawn cotton, gingham, soft linen, calico, etc. Even ribbon will work nicely. If you don't have any fabric spare at home, rummage through a sales basket at the craft shop; you only need enough to cover the rings. Some things to consider:


Whether you will have a mixed color theme or a single color
Whether you will have patterns or color merges around each ring;
, The size of the rings is up to you but it is advisable not to make them too large for your body size. The image above shows 6 rings being used to form the circle; you will need as many rings as form a circle suited to your wrist size.

, The width of the strips should be about 1–2""/2.5 centimeter (1.0 in)–5 centimeter (2.0 in); test the width on your rings for suitability. Whether you cut or tear the strips is up to you - it affects the finished look and either look is stylish. The length of the strips should be enough to wrap around each ring but if you run out, or want to intermingle colors, that's not a problem, as you can simply glue a new strip into place.

, When you meet the end, or join in a new piece, simply hot glue the strip into place.

,, Hot glue each ring side by side to form the circle shape as seen in the image above. Leave to dry. Once dry, the bracelet is ready to wear.

Wear the bracelet.",How to Crochet a Bracelet1," Attach the thread to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches long enough to wrap around your wrist three times.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your wrist.
This pattern is easy to alter. Size 10 crochet thread will create a relatively sleek bracelet, but you could use thicker cotton yarn if you would prefer a chunkier chain. Similarly, you can create fewer or more wrap-arounds by crocheting a shorter or longer chain, respectively.;
, At the end of your foundation chain, work one notably loose, large chain stitch.

This extra large chain stitch will turn into a button hole. Make sure that it is large enough for the button to fit through but tight enough to prevent the button from easily slipping out.

, Work one more chain stitch beyond the button hole to secure the loop.

Note that you may need to hold the button hole chain while working on this final chain stitch. If you don't hold the button loop, it may shrink as you work the final chain.

, Work one slip stitch into the last chain of the previous row, then work one slip stitch into each of the remaining chains across the foundation., Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off., Using a yarn needle, thread both the beginning tail and end tail through the button. Tie two square knots behind the button to secure it to the end of the bracelet.

Weave the remaining excess into the stitches to secure the ends.
Alternatively, you can trim the ends and glue them down to secure the bracelet. Use fabric seam sealant if adhering the yarn to itself, or hot glue if adhering it to the back of the button.

, The bracelet should be done and ready to show off. Wrap it around your wrist three times, then slip the button through the button hole at the opposite end to hold it around your wrist."

If you only use one color of thread, you won't be able to create a pattern.4-6 strands will make a narrow bracelet, and 8-10 strands will make a thicker one. The more strands you chose, the wider the bracelet will be.;
, Measure a length of thread slightly longer than the distance from your fingertip to your shoulder and then cut it. This will be long enough for the bracelet to stretch around your wrist to create a pattern. It's better to cut the string a bit too long than too short.





, Hold the cut strand up to the remaining strands and cut them to be the same length as this strand.




, You can also get creative and tie it around your toe.





You can also tape it to a surface, or close it in a drawer, but pinning is better than taping because the pin ensures that the bracelet will stay in its position.

, Before you start the system of knotting that will create a pattern in the bracelet, spread out the threads so that the colors are in the order you'd like the striped patterns on the bracelet to be. To make the knotted end of your bracelet less bulky, try not to cross the threads over one another too much.




, You will need to make the ""half-hitch"" knot to do this correctly.








First, move the first thread over the top of the 2nd thread. Make sure to leave some of the first strand on the other side so that there is a loop.
Bring the first thread behind the second thread and then pull it through the loop.
Hold the second thread firmly while you pull on the first thread. As you do this, a knot will move up to the top of the second thread.

, After you make the second knot with the first and second strand, you will need to use the first strand to make two knots in the third strand, and then the fourth, and so on. Keep going until there are two knots on every strand.








Make sure that you pull on the thread just until you feel resistance. Be careful not to pull too tight because if some knots are tighter than others the bracelet will look lumpy and uneven.Continue knotting the first strand around each successive thread, moving from left to right, until you've knotted all of the strands and the first strand is in the far right position., This will be the new first thread. Every thread will end up on the right when you're done, and you'll start with a new color of thread every time. Repeat the double knot technique with the far left strand, moving from left to right until the strand is in the far right position.







, To make sure it fits well, try it on your wrist. There should be enough extra room that you (or the person who will wear the bracelet) can fit about two fingers in next to your wrist.








, Make sure that the knot doesn’t take up any of the length you need to wear the bracelet.








, If you still have a lot of string left over, you can cut it short with a pair of scissors.








, Now that you've knotted both ends of the bracelet, just tie the strands of the bracelet together. If you have a friend putting on the bracelet for you, then you can also have the friend knot the bracelet after you put it on if you want it to be really tight.








, Before beginning the main design, you can start with a simple braid, which will be on the ends of the bracelet. Gather neighboring individual strings into groups of two or three so that you have three main threads to braid with (left, center, right).








, Take whichever thread is currently in the right position and cross it over the top of the center thread. That thread now becomes the center thread. Next, take whichever thread is currently in the left position and cross it over the top of the center thread so that thread now becomes the center thread.








Repeat this pattern -- right over center, left over center -- until you've reached the desired length of braid, which should be about an inch (2.54cm) or less.

, Once you've reached the desired amount of the simple braid, about an inch (2.54cm) or less, tie a knot before you begin braiding the striped pattern.








, If you did a simple braid for the beginning of the bracelet, you can do the same for the other end. After you have a good length of the striped pattern, finish the bracelet with a short length of simple braid.








, To give your friendship bracelet some more flair, thread some small beads or charms onto the strands and then tie them in a knot to secure them.

Chain around your fist.,
Slip stitch the ends together.,
Single crochet across the first round.,
Repeat for the next four rounds.,
Switch hooks and double crochet around.,
Alternate back post and front post double crochet.,
Double crochet around.,
Fasten off the yarn.,
Fold the piece in half.,
Wear the bracelet.",How to Crochet a Bracelet2," Attach the yarn to the size F crochet hook using a standard slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches large enough to fit over the widest part of your hand.

Since this will be a bangle-style bracelet, the foundation chain must be large enough to fit over your hand. As such, you must measure it around the knuckles or base of the thumb instead of measuring the chain around your wrist.
For this pattern to work up properly, you'll need to create a foundation chain in multiples of two (30, 32, 34, 36, etc.). Keep the stitches somewhat loose, as well.

, Once you reach the end of the foundation, slip stitch the last chain to the first.

Straighten out the chain before attaching the two ends. If the chain is twisted, you won't be able to complete the pattern correctly.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet in each chain stitch across the foundation round.

Once you reach the end of this new round, slip stitch the last and first single crochet together.

, Repeat the first round pattern for rows two through five.

Chain one, then single crochet in each stitch across the round. Slip stitch the ends together.
You should have a total of five single crochet rounds by the end of this step.

, Switch to the size G crochet hook. Chain two, then work one double crochet into the back loop of each stitch across the round.

Work carefully when switching hooks so that you do not lose the hook loop and unravel your previous stitches.
Once you reach the end of the round, slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.

, Chain two. Work one double crochet into the front post of the next stitch, then one double crochet into the back post of the stitch after that.

Work one double crochet into the front post of the following stitch and one double crochet into the back post of the stitch after that; repeat across the remainder of the round. You should end with a front-post double crochet.
At the end of the round, slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.

, Chain two. Double crochet once into the front post of the first stitch, then double crochet once into the back post of the next stitch.

Front post double crochet once into each front-post stitch of the previous round and back post double crochet into each back-post stitch of the previous round. Continue across the entire round in this manner.
Slip stitch the last double crochet to the top of the chain-two.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring 14 inches (35.5 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off., Fold the tube in half so that the single crochet rounds are on the inside and the ribbed rounds remain on the outside.

Thread the long tail through the eye of a yarn needle and whip stitch the folded edges together. Stitch through the back loops of the ribbed edge and the foundation chain loops on the single crochet side.
Knot the yarn after you finish sewing the edges together, then weave in all ends along the underside of the stitches.

, The bracelet should be finished and ready to wear. Simply slip it over your hand and onto your wrist."

Repeat across the row.,
Work back across the opposite side.,
Fasten off the yarn.,
Sew a button onto the opposite end.,
Wear the bracelet.",How to Crochet a Bracelet3," Thread 12 to 24 beads onto a length of embroidery thread or thin craft wire.

Craft wire can be easier to work with, but the resulting bracelet won't be machine washable and will be stiffer and heavier.
Use enough thread and enough beads to wrap around your wrist. Do not cut the spool-end of the thread or wire after threading the beads.

, Clear 2 inches (5 cm) at the tail end of the thread. Create a loop from this tail, knotting it just above the top bead.

If desired, you could leave beads on the thread used for this loop to create a more decorative stopper. The size of the stopper should still remain the same, however.

, Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then position the hook above the thread.

Place the crochet hook and starting loop above the beaded thread, directly between the looped stopper and the top bead.
The knotted part of the loop and the working end of your thread should fall behind the thread, however.

, Work one chain stitch with the yarn. As you create this chain, you should trap the base of the thread inside., Chain stitch twice, then slide the first bead beside the base of this chain. Single crochet around the wire on the opposite side of the bead to lock it into place.

The number of chains may vary depending on the size of the bead. Create enough chains to extend around the top and side of the entire bead.
Work the single crochet in between the first and second beads. Since there are no stitches to work into, you'll need to reach beneath the thread with the tip of the hook, grab the yarn there, and work the single crochet stitch around the side of the thread.

, Chain two, then single crochet once around the thread on the opposite side of the next bead. Repeat this pattern across the entire length of beads, or until the bracelet reaches your desired length.

End the pattern with a single crochet beside the final bead.
Note that you may need to make fewer or more chains to work around your beads, but the number of chains should remain consistent from bead to bead.

, Chain four and flip the work over. Repeat the same pattern back across the same length, wrapping the yarn across the bottom side of each bead as you go.

Chain two. Draw the chain around the bottom of the next bead, then single crochet over the thread and beside the single crochet of the previous row.

Repeat this pattern across the entire row, ending with a single crochet to the front of the first bead.



, Cut the yarn, leaving 3 inches (7.6 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

If you have a considerable amount of thread in between the crocheted beadwork and the stopper loop, you may wish to wrap the yarn around the exposed thread several times before fastening it off.
Weave the excess tail into the stitches to secure it.

, Thread a standard sewing needle with all-purpose sewing thread, then stitch the decorative button onto the end of the bracelet opposite the stopper loop.

You should only need to make a few stitches to secure the button to the bracelet.
Use a button that is small enough to fit through the loop yet large enough to avoid slipping through by accident.

, The bracelet should be finished and ready to wear. Wrap it around your wrist and slide the button through the stopper loop to hold it in place."

Fold the top corner down.,
Begin wrapping the bandana.,
Wrap the other segment.,
Grab the ends.,
Tie the ends into a knot.,
Tuck the unwanted ends.",How to Make a Bandana Bracelet1," Lay the bandana on a flat surface. Spread the edges outward until the bandana is a large square. Smooth any folds so that the bandana lies flat.


Turn the bandana so that one corner is facing you. This will make it easier to fold into a bracelet.;
, Take the bottom corner of the bandana in your fingers and bring it to meet the top corner. Smooth the center fold and you should have a nice triangle shape.









If you don't want your bracelet to be as thick you can cut your bandana across the fold line to create two triangles.Once folded, the half bandana will look very similar but it will feel a lot less bulky.

, Take a couple inches of fabric from the top corner and fold it down over the rest of the bandana. You can fold the section slightly larger or smaller depending the width you want your bracelet to be. Continue to fold over the width of the bandana until you reach the folded part of the triangle you made.








, Start by placing the folded bandana on your wrist. Leave a little more length hanging on the left side than the right, if wearing it on your right hand. Take the right side and wrap in under your wrist, then pull it over the top of your wrist.









If you have a flat surface to work on, you can also lay your wrist on the folded bandana. Leave a little more of the length of the bandana on your right side. Fold the right end over your wrist. Then, fold the right end underneath your wrist again so the end is sticking out on the right side again.

, Hold the part that went over your wrist with the hand that is wearing the bandana. Then grab the left piece with your free hand. Wrap the left end of the bandana under your wrist, then over the top of the wrist.








, Hold on to the left end with your left hand. Use your fingers on your right hand to grab the right end. If you have to, use your teeth to grab it and move it to where your fingers can hold the end in place by pressing it to your palm.


If you're with a friend, have your friend grab the ends and tie them for you.

, Bring the left end over the right end, then wrap it underneath. Pull the left end down while holding the right end in place to tighten the knot.









Knot the ends twice to help keep your bracelet from coming undone too easily. Adding a second knot may make difficult to untie, and you may have to even cut it off to remove it. If you want to keep the bracelet on permanently, adjust the bracelet to a comfortable size and tie a second knot. Wrap the left end around the right again and pull the end through the loop, then pull both ends until tight.
You could also use a hair pin, safety pins, or rubber bands to hold your bracelet ends in place. Put a pin through the left end, then through the right end and fasten the pin to keep them together. Or wrap a rubber band around the left and right ends to keep them held together. Either of these methods will work if you have such items handy.

, Take the remaining tips of fabric sticking out from the knot or pins and tuck them underneath the bracelet. You can also trim off the ends with scissors if you prefer.

, Take a small bowl or cup and fill it half way up with water. Put the bandana strip in the water. Move it around slightly The fabric may be a bit resistant to water, so give it a couple minutes to soak. Remove the bandana strip and squeeze out the excess water.








, Twist each end with your fingers. Twist one end away from you, and twist the other end toward you. Eventually you will meet in the middle and have one long twisted piece of fabric.








, Hold one end in your right hand. Use your fingers and hold the bandana in place against your palm. Wrap the bandana around with your wrist with your left hand.








, Bring the bandana around your wrist again. Stop when the end in your left hand reaches your palm again.








, You might want to leave a little slack in the bracelet so it fits comfortably on your wrist. Just be sure you don't make it too loose so that it falls off easily. Once you tie the knot you won't be able to adjust it, so find a comfortable fit first.








, Keep the right end in place with your right fingers and your palm. Bring the left end over the right, then underneath. Wrap the left end around your finger and pull the right end through to make the knot.









Try resting your arm against a table to help hold the bracelet in place if you are tying the knot yourself. You may also need to use your teeth to grab and hold pieces.
You may want to ask a friend to help to tie the knots if possible. Having an extra set of hands will make tying the bracelet much easier to do.

, Use the scissors to trim the excess off the ends. You can leave the knot on top or tuck it underneath the bracelet if you want.

Continue braiding.,
Finish your braid.",How to Make a Braided Headband1," In order to create a smooth braid, you will need to have tangle-free hair. Freshly washed hair is the most difficult to braid because it is so slick, so use one day old (or several days old) dirty hair for your headband. You can use wet or dry hair, although if you begin with wet hair it will be wavy when you remove it from your braid at the end of the day.;
, Your braid will be giving the illusion of a headband, so it needs to cross from ear to ear. Use a comb to create a smooth, even part running horizontally across your head from behind one ear to the back of another. Try to avoid any jagged lines or waves in your part; the straighter the line the better it will look. Pull back the rest of your hair into a ponytail.








, Comb your hair horizontally across your head, starting at the base of one ear. When it is smooth, section your hair into three even pieces at the base of your hair.








, Use the three pieces of hair to start a traditional braid. Take the section on the right, and cross it over the middle section of hair. Then, do the same with the left section, crossing it over the middle piece.








, As you braid, pick up small pieces of hair from your parted section in addition to your regular three sections. Pick up a piece on the right, add it to the right strand, and cross it over the center. Pick up a piece on the left, add it to the left strand, and cross it over the center.








, Work your way across your head above your hairline, adding in more strands of hair as you go. Your braid may have been thin to start, but will begin gathering size as you add more strands.








, As you get close to your ear, finish the braid by tying it off with a small clear elastic. The loose ends of the braid will blend in with your hair down, or can be incorporated into an updo. You can also choose to braid your hair in a regular braid to the very ends, and then tie the tips off with a ponytail.

Rock your headband.",How to Make a Naruto Headband," You can purchase your fabric from your local fabric store. If you don’t have a fabric store near you, you can order it online.


Fabric stores usually have a discount section. If you’re on a budget, check there first.
You will need about one yard (36 inches) of fabric so that you have plenty of material to wrap around your head and tie in the back.
You can use any type of fabric, such as cotton, linen, or rayon. However, these fabrics will fray on the edges. Other fabrics, such as jersey knit, faux leather, or vinyl will not fray. Of these, knit fabric will likely be the easiest to find in the color you need (and less expensive than the others).;
, Be sure that the strip of fabric you cut is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide and however long you need to wrap around your head. Leave enough extra to tie off behind your head.


It would be a good idea to measure around your head first and determine the length you would like your headband to be.
Be sure to cut your edges straight. Lay out your fabric on a flat surface and use a measuring stick and chalk to create an outline for your headband.

, If you have opted for a fabric that frays around the edges after being cut (such as cotton), you can apply an anti-fray aerosol spray to the edges to make your headband last longer and prevent wear and tear., You can use cardboard, poster board, or an aluminum can for a more authentic look.

If you are using cardboard or poster board, grab a measuring stick and trace an approximately 2 inch (height) by 6 inch (length) rectangle. Round each of the four corners.
If you are using a recycled aluminum can, wash and dry the can first. Take some scissors and create a slit lengthwise down the center of the can (from top to bottom). Carefully cut around the top and bottom of the can and discard those pieces. Take the aluminum from the middle of the can and bend it back and forth to smooth it out.Measure and cut your aluminum (approximately 2 inches by 6 inches with rounded corners).

, (Skip this step if you have used aluminum.) Choose a silver paint with a metallic finish, and but be sure to allow plenty of time for it to dry. Paint only on the side that will be visible once it is applied to your fabric.

, Use a marker to draw the emblem of your choice in the center of your cardboard or aluminum piece.


If you are worried about making a mistake, trace the image with a pencil first. Don’t press down too hard, though, because the indentations will still show in your cardboard or aluminum.

, If you don’t want your fabric to show through your emblem, use a permanent marker to draw the circles instead of cutting them.


Alternately, you could cut the backs off of six round, silver thumb tacks and glue them to the sides of your emblem plate.

, When you are satisfied with the plate, apply super glue to the back of the plate. Press the plate firmly into the center of the middle of your fabric headband.Adding a phone book or other large book as a weight will improve bonding.

, The instructions on your glue will tell you how long to wait. When the glue has dried, your headband is complete.

, Wear your headband with pride as you represent your village.

",How to Make a Braided Headband2," To start your braid, you must first have tangle-free strands. Brush through your hair to remove any knots, and mist it lightly with water if your hair is very busy. Avoid braiding your hair the same day you wash it, as it will be very slick as a result of being clean and be difficult to braid. Whenever possible, wait 1-2 days after your most recent shower to create this braided look.








, You will be creating a faux-headband, so your hair should be parted in a line along where a real headband would naturally sit on your head. Use a comb to mark your part from ear to ear, in an even section. Try to avoid creating a jagged or bumpy line; a smooth part will create the best braid.








, An inverted braid is started the same way a traditional braid is, with three pieces of hair. Brush all your hair in the same direction from one ear to the other. Then, at the ear you started brushing from pick up three, even sections of hair.








, You will start with a traditional braid, but unlike a normal braid or braided headband, move your pieces under rather than over the center section. Pick up the right piece, and move it under the middle section. Then, take the left piece and move it under the middle section.








, As you move your braid along, you will want to add other pieces of hair to it. When you are moving the right section, pick up another small piece of hair and incorporate it into the right section before placing it under the middle section. Do the same for the left section, by picking up additional hair and moving it under the center section.








, Work your way across your parted section, adding in small pieces to your braid as you go. Make sure to always add the strands under the center section rather than over, in order to make the braid stick out from your head. Your braid may be thicker on the side you end on than the side you started on as a result of gathering a bit more hair.








, When you get to your opposite ear with the braid, tie it off with a small clear elastic band. Finger-brush the ends of the strands out, so that you can incorporate the loose unbraided section back into your regular hair. You can also chose to braid the section in a regular braid all the way to the ends, and then secure the tips of this braid with your elastic band.

Gather your supplies.,
Measure the length of your headband.,
Form your headband.,
Take apart the flowers.,
Glue the flowers to your headband.,
Allow the headband to dry.",How to Make a Flower Headband," Rather than buying a floral headband, making your own is quick, easy, and inexpensive. For this DIY project, you will need:1/2” thick elastic (can be found at any craft store)

An elastic headband can be used if you already own one


Fake flowers (can be found at any craft store)
Hot glue gun (E6000 or super glue can also be used)Scissors;
, Wrap the elastic around the top of your head. Once you find the right length, hold the spot with your fingers. Unwrap the elastic from your head and use scissors to cut the elastic at the spot marked by your fingers.








If you already have your own headband, you can skip this step.
The headband can be any color you like; both dark- and light-colored headbands look nice.

, Use your glue gun (or other type of glue) to dab some glue on one end of your elastic. Bring the other end of the elastic to the dab of glue, and place it on top of the glue.Press the two ends together for about 10 seconds. When the glue is dried, you have your headband.









Be sure that the elastic isn’t twisted when you connect the ends with glue. It will make the flowers twist and be uneven when you glue them on.

, Pull the artificial flowers off the stems. You should easily be able to pluck them off the stems. At the bottom of the flower, there will be a small, green stem (used to hold the flowers to the longer stems). Cut off the smaller stem under the flower so the bottoms of the flowers are flat.








You can either leave the flowers whole, as they are, or pull the flowers apart to expose the different layers of petals.

, If you leave the flowers as they are (whole), apply glue onto the back of the flower using the hot glue gun.Then place the flower onto the headband and hold it in place for about 10 seconds. If you pulled the flowers apart to expose the layers of petals, it may be easier to place a small dot of glue on the headband, and then stick the petal layer onto the glue.Press and hold the petal layer down for about 10 seconds. Space the flowers out as evenly as you want. Continue to add flowers to the headband until you are satisfied with the headband.









If you are using any glue other than a glue gun, consider first applying glue to the flower, then placing it on the headband.It will create less mess.

, If you used a hot glue gun to attach the flowers to your headband, your headband will be completely dry after about 30 minutes. If you used E6000 or super glue, let the headband dry for at least a day so nothing falls off when you try to wear it.

This next step can be two different ways, the first way is tying the ends together before you put it on or you can wrap it around your head and then tie the ends together.",How to Make a Yarn Headband1," Choose one to three different colors. The length doesn't matter as long as it goes around your head. If you have thick hair, make sure it is long enough to go around twice.;

Cut other pieces of felt to cover the headband.,
Glue the felt in place on the headband.",How to Make a Bunny Ears Headband," To make a bunny ears headband, you need to start with the right headband. A plastic style will work fine, but a metal band is sturdier so you don’t have to worry about it breaking. Look for a headband that’s approximately 1- to 2-inches wide (2.5- to 5-cm).It doesn’t matter what color the headband that you use is. You’re going to cover it with fabric later.;
, For the ears, you’ll need felt in two colors, one darker and one lighter. Using your headband as a guide to help you determine the width, use a marker to freehand draw two rabbit’s ear shapes on the darker felt. The ears should be approximately 7-inches (18-cm) long.








For a simple looking pair of bunny ears, draw long oval shape ears.
If you aren’t comfortable freehand drawing the ears, you can find a variety templates online at craft websites, such as Kidspot .
Keep in mind that you’re going to fold the edge of the ear over to conceal the wire later, so make the ears slightly wider than you want them to be.
When it comes to felt colors, you might use gray, black, or brown for the darker portion of the ear and white or pink for the smaller, interior portion. You can go also go monochromatic, such as using a dark gray with a light gray.
You don’t necessarily have to use felt. Any fabric in two colors will work. If you want more realistic looking bunny ears, consider using faux fur.

, Once you’ve traced the ears shapes on your felt, use a pair of fabric scissors to cut the shape out. Set the ears aside for a moment.







, After you’ve cut out the larger ear shapes from the dark felt, repeat the process with the light colored felt. The ear shape should be the same as the first set, but the lighter colored ears should be slightly narrower.








You don’t need to make the light colored ears as long as the darker ears either. There should be approximately 2- to 3-inches (5- to 8-cm) of dark felt below the light felt so you can wrap it around the headband to hide the wire.
When you lay the lighter colored ear shape on the darker colored ears, there should be enough space to place the wire that maintains the ear shape and fold over the darker colored felt to hide it.

, When you’ve cut out the smaller, lighter colored pieces of felt, position them in the center of the darker felt ears so there is a border around the top, sides, and bottom. Use a hot glue gun to adhere the light felt to the dark felt.








You can use your favorite type of craft glue that works on fabric in place of the hot glue if you prefer.

, To keep the bunny ears standing up, you need to add wire support. Use a pair of wire cutters to cut two pieces of 20 gauge hobby wire. Each piece should be long enough to form into an outline of the bunny ears with at least 5 inches (13-cm) of excess on either side of the bottom.You can find 20 gauge hobby wire at most craft stores.
You can substitute floral wire if you prefer.

, Once you’ve cut the pieces of wire to the proper length, use your hands to carefully bend it into roughly the same shape as each bunny ear. The wire forms should be slightly smaller than the darker felt ears., After you’ve shaped the wire, place it on felt ears. Set it so it’s resting on the dark felt just outside the light colored felt and there is excess wire beneath the end of the dark felt. Next, use hot glue to adhere the wire to the felt.








While you can use other craft glue to adhere the fabric pieces together, it’s best to use hot glue to secure the wire in place to ensure a strong bond.

, While the glue around the wire is set warm, fold the edge of the dark ear shape over the wire all around the top and sides of the ears. You should also hide the edge of the light color felt for a seamless look.








After you’ve hot glued the wire and edge of the ears, allow them to cool for 5 to 10 minutes so you know the glue has set before assembling the headband.

, When the glue has set, decide where you want to position the ears on the headband. Wrap the excess wire at the bottom of the ears around the headband to set them in place.








Make sure that the light centers of the ears are facing forward when you wrap the wire around the headband.

, To make sure that the ears are secure, add several dollops of hot glue around the wire on headband. If there is an excess felt at the bottom of the ears, wrap that around the headband and secure with glue as well.








Don’t worry if there isn’t excess material at the end of the ears to hide the wire. You can cover the wire with felt scraps in the next steps.

, You can leave the headband as is if you like. However, if you want it to have a more finished look, take more of the dark colored felt and cut out several longer strips that you can wrap around the exposed headband.You don’t necessarily have to use the same felt that you used for the ears to cover the headband. For example, you might want to use satin ribbon to cover the headband.

, When you’ve cut the felt into strips that fit the headband, wrap them around the headband. Use hot glue as needed to secure the felt in place. Allow the glue to set for at least 10 to 15 minutes before wearing the headband.

Wear your fabulous headband!",How to Knit a Skinny Headband," As a general rule of thumb, the needles should be close to the thickness of the yarn. But if you want easy lacy holes in the headband, use large needles with thin yarn. Choose a stiffer yarn if you're working with an intricate pattern that you do not want to stretch out; cotton yarn works well.

, The fewer stitches, the skinnier the headband; the more stitches, the thicker. Leave approximately 3-4 inches (7.5cm-10cm) of tail yarn.

, (You also want a little extra in case you are knitting this for someone else.) If you like the i-cord, you can make the whole headband in this fashion, but for this article we will assume you're going on.

See How to knit an i-cord to learn how.

, If you began with three stitches, knit the first stitch, knit the front and the back of the second stitch, and knit the third stitch. Then purl the wrong side of the headband. Continue to increase in the middle of the stitches and knit the outside stitches, while purling on the other side. The more times your increase in one row, the faster the headband will grow in width. Increase to anywhere between six to ten stitches.


See How to knit increases for more details.

, Stockinette (knitting on the right side and purling on the wrong side) would not be best because the edges will curl. Here are some more ideas that would work well:


Garter stitch (knitting every single stitch) is very stretchy and does not curl. It creates a horizontal rib. You may use any number of stitches.







Ribbing will work well with an even number of stitches; knit one stitch then purl one stitch, until the end of the row, turn, and repeat. It creates a vertical rib.







Seed stitch requires an even number of stitches. On the right side, knit one, purl one, and repeat. On the wrong side, purl one, knit one, and repeat. This creates a bumpy texture.






Moss stitch requires multiples of four; twelve stitches would be good for a skinny headband. On the right side knit two, purl two, and repeat. On the wrong side, purl two, knit two, and repeat until the end of the row.






Simple cable and garter border: Begin with an even number of stitches; for this example we will use eight stitches. Assuming you are starting on the right side:





Knit 2, slip 2 stitches onto the cable needle and hold in back, knit 2, knit 2 stitches of cable needle, knit 2.
Knit 2, purl 4, knit 2.
Knit 8.
Knit 2, purl 4, knit 2.

Knit 2, purl 4, knit 2.


Or use the internet to find your own! Check out the stitch gallery noted in the ""Sources and Citations"" below.

, Remember to stretch the yarn while fitting.
, For example if you had eight stitches, knit one, knit two together, knit one, knit two together, knit one, knit two together. Purl the wrong side and continue in a similar fashion until you have for example, three stitches left. See Knit Decreases to learn how.

,, Leave approximately 3-4 inches (7.5cm to 10cm) of tail yarn on this end as well.

, Pull it out some distance along the i-cord, pull it so it's very taunt and snip it. Then pull at the i-cord so that the yarn end shrinks into the i-cord. Repeat this at the other end.
, Wrap it around your head, making sure the right side is facing outwards, and tie the i-cords together at the nape of your neck in a square knot.

Secure the corker bow.",How to Decorate a Headband2," To make corker bows, you will need several lengths of corker ribbon, a selection of 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) wooden dowels, some wooden clothes pegs and a needle and thread.

, To start, secure one end of the corker ribbon at the end of a wooden dowel using a wooden clothes peg. Then start wrapping the corker ribbon tightly around the dowel until you reach the end. Secure with another clothes peg.

, Do this for as many pieces of ribbon as you like, then place the ribbon-wrapped dowels on a cookie sheet covered in aluminum foil and bake in the over for 25 minutes at 275 °F (135 °C). After 25 minutes, take the dowels out of the oven and leave to cool completely.

, When the ribbons have cooled, remove the clothes pegs and gently unwind the corker ribbon from the dowels. The ribbon should form a tight curl which holds its shape. Cut the corker ribbon into three inch pieces and lay them out in a row.

, Take a threaded needle with the knot tied about three inches from the end. Start threading the pieces of corker ribbon onto the needle. Stack the pieces on the needle, don't push them down onto the thread just yet.

, When all of the pieces have been threaded (or there's no more room on the needle) push the bunch of corker ribbon all the way down the thread, until they are sitting on top of the knot. The bring your needle around the back and run it through the corker pieces a second time.

, Grab the loose thread under the knot and bring it to the top of the bow. Use both ends of the thread to make a tight double knot. This will secure the corker bow.Use a hot glue gun to attach the corker bow to the headband.

Find a wide plastic headband, preferably one with a fabric covering as this will allow the embellishments to stick better.
You will also need a hot glue gun.

, Try the headband on and mark a spot just above your ear on both sides. You don't want to embellish past this mark, or the headband will be uncomfortable to wear.

, Take your hot glue gun and start attaching the embellishments - you can completely cover the headband for an over-the-top, runway look or keep it a little more simple for understated glam.

Glue the ends.",How to Decorate a Headband4," Take four 40 inch (101.6 cm) pieces of 3⁄8 inch (1.0 cm) ribbon in four different colors and a plastic headband.


Hot glue two lengths of ribbon together, end to end, so you have one extra long piece of ribbon. The ends should overlap by about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).
Do the same with the other two lengths of ribbon.

, Take one of the extra long ribbons and position the seam (where the two colors meet) over the inside edge of the headband. You want it to form a diagonal angle with the end of the headband. Glue the ribbon in place.


Take the second extra long piece of ribbon and do the same -- except this time you are positioning the seam over the outside edge of the headband, going in the opposite diagonal.
In other words, the two lengths of ribbon should form an ""X"" shape over the end of the headband.

, Fold the the upper left ribbon down across the seam so it is now on the right side and fold the upper right right ribbon down so it is now on the left. You should have two different colored ribbons on each side of the headband.

, Now that you have correctly set up your ribbons, it's time to start weaving. The weaving method described below will create a pretty pattern of triangles and diamonds. Although it's possible to use this technique with ribbons of the same color, using four different colors will make it easier to keep track of which ribbon goes where.

Take the right front ribbon and wrap it around the back of the headband. It should emerge beneath the other two pieces of ribbon on the left.






Take the right back ribbon and wrap it across the front of the headband so that all four pieces of ribbon are on the left, two at the front and two at the back.






Take the upper back piece of ribbon and wrap it around the front of the headband, weaving it between the two front ribbons. It should end up on the right side of the headband.






Take the upper front ribbon on the left and wrap it around the back of the headband, weaving it beneath the back piece of ribbon. It should end up on the right side of the headband.







, Now you are back to your starting position, with two pieces of ribbon on the right and two pieces of ribbon on the left.


Continue to use the same weaving pattern until the entire headband is covered.
Use alligator clips as you make your way along the headband to keep the ribbon tight and prevent any gaps.

, When you get to the end, continue weaving the ribbon for about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) past the end of the headband, then glue the ribbon in place and cut off the excess. Remove the alligator clips and enjoy your pretty woven headband."

Use fabric paint.,
Attach feathers.,
Attach felt flowers.",How to Decorate a Headband6," A nice way to decorate fabric headbands is to use fabric paint. You can either decorate them free style or use fabric stencils.


Fabric stencils allow you to paint letters onto the fabric, so you can spell out cute words like ""Love"" or ""Star"" or ""LOL"" or even your name.
Just cover the stencil in the fabric paint and press it firmly onto the headband. Use a small paint brush to carefully fill in any gaps in the paint.
To add a little bit of glitz to the headband, you can shake some glitter onto the fabric paint while it's still wet.

, A cute and easy way to decorate a fabric headband is just to attach a bunch of colored feathers.


Take a selection of three feathers and hold them at the stems. Fan the feathers out slightly.
Use a a dab of hot glue to attach the bunch of feathers to one side of the fabric headband, just above where your ear will be.
If you like, you can glue a large sequin or pin a brooch over the stems of the feathers to cover them up.

, You can make some simple but cute flower attachments for a fabric headband using felt.


Take a square of felt and trace out a flower shape (using a stencil of necessary). Trace out two more flower shapes, each one slightly smaller than the last.
Sit the smallest flower inside the medium flower and the medium flower inside the biggest flower and use some hot glue or a couple of basic stitches to secure.
Glue a crystal, button or pearl into the center of the flower, then glue the flower onto the headband.
You can leave it at a single flower or you can make more to cover the entire headband.
Alternatively, you can just cut the tops off of some fake plastic flowers and glue those to the headband instead.

Thread the yarn through a tapestry needle, then thread all the beads for your pattern--or at least all you expect to use before switching colors or skeins--onto the yarn.,
Knit until you'd like to place a bead (between stitches).,
Continue knitting, placing beads between stitches as you go.",How to Knit With Beads1,"


If the yarn is too thick to thread through a needle that will fit through the beads, your beads might be too small for the yarn. Try this before you give up; poke the end of the yarn through a wire needle threader, then thread the beads onto the needle threader and pull them down onto the strand of yarn.
Allow the beads to collect against the skein of yarn until you need one.;
, Knit the stitch before the bead, draw the bead up against the just-completed stitch, then knit the next stitch firmly.


Knitting the stitches to each side of the bead firmly helps hold the bead in place.
If you want the bead to show on the front or ""right"" side of your work, place it between purl stitches. In other words, purl the stitch before you slip the bead up against your work, then purl the next stitch as well, no matter what the pattern says.
If you want the bead to show on the back or ""wrong"" side of your work, place it between knit stitches.

,


If you run out of beads before you run out of yarn, cut the yarn, thread more beads onto the new working yarn, then join the 2 ends of yarn and continue knitting.

Determine the length and width of the beaded strip you will need.,
Now that you have a width (measured in beads) for your belt, use the graph paper to plan out the design you want.,
Make your bead strip.",How to Make a Bead Belt1," Next, determine how many beads wide it will be. The simplest way to do this is to string beads, then measure the desired width against the string.

, Give some thought to how the pattern will look if you stop mid-design due to the length of your belt. If you are using a pre-made belt, keeping the width to the same width as the stitches that hold both pieces of the belt together will save on wear and tear. The same goes for making your own belt, though where these seams go will be up to you.

, If you do not know how to bead at all, just follow the directions that come with your loom. Actually, a belt may not be the trickiest beginner project, though you might want to try a bracelet or something of a similar width first. You want the strip to be fit from just before the hole you plan to use in the belt, and the edge where the stitches attaching the buckle is.

"
"
Cast on and knit as usual, until you get to the stitch where you'd like to add a bead.,
Poke the crochet hook through the bead, then hook the stitch you're attaching the bead to off the left-hand knitting needle.

,
Slide the bead down onto the stitch, then slide the stitch back onto your left-hand needle and continue knitting.,
Finished.

",How to Knit With Beads2,"


Note that this technique places each bead on a stitch instead of between stitches.
You need a crochet hook fine enough to fit through the hole in the bead you're attaching to your work.

,,


The bead will be firmly fixed in place once you complete the stitch it's strung on.

,"
"
Lay the strip flat on the front of the belt, line it up, and stitch through the edges with clear beading thread.",How to Make a Bead Belt2," This will be difficult, and you will likely need a very heavy needle made for leatherwork.;
"
"
Cut 2 strips of equal size to the width you wish you belt to be.,
Attach the buckle to one strip according to the directions.

,
Line the bead strip up on the strip with the buckle attached.,
Sew along the edges of the strip with clear beading thread to attach it.,
Line the bottom strip up under the top one.

,
Mark where you want your hole.

,
How you shape the end is up to you.,
Sew along the edges of the two strips to attach them together.,Punch a hole

,
All done, you now have a beaded belt!

",How to Make a Bead Belt3," Be sure to leave a bit of room on either side, width wise, beyond where the bead strip will extend. This will show once you have attached the beads, which will save on wear and tear. Each strip should be a bit longer than the belt will be, since you still need to attach the buckle. These strips will be sewn on top of each other to make the belt thick enough.

,, It should begin right after where you want the hole, and end right before the buckle.

, This will be easiest with a needle made for sewing leather, though quilting needles may work if you don't have a leather needle.

,,, The usual shape is probably easiest. Make sure you have the two sides lined up well, and pinned together, before you cut.

, You can either use a straight row of stitches just above where the bead strip, or wrap the stitches over and around the edge of the belt, depending on the look you want. Use contrasting thread for a different look.

Fire your pot.",How to Glaze a Pot," Glazes come in a variety of colors and consistencies. They can come in liquid or powder form and can be specially formulated for specific application methods. In other words, a dipping glaze is different from a glaze designed to be brushed or sponged onto your pot.You can buy pre-mixed glazes at your local pottery supplies store. If you are just starting out as a potter, you will probably want to begin by buying pre-mixed glazes.
As you become more experienced with glazes, you might want to develop your own recipe based on how you want your pots to look and your favorite application method.;
, Brushes come in various shapes and sizes and are meant to accomplish different tasks during the glazing process.


Thick brushes are useful for covering large areas, and thinner ones for small touch-up jobs. If you buy a set you will have everything you need., If there is any excess clay or uneven patches left on your pot after the initial firing, you can smooth them out with sandpaper, a kitchen knife, or a dental tool.


Wear gloves while working with your pot to prevent contaminating it with any lotions or soaps that might be on your hands.
Be sure to work outside or in a well-ventilated area, and consider wearing a surgical mask as inhaling clay dust can be very bad for your lungs., Be sure to remove all dust or other material left over after the initial firing.


A pneumatic air compressor or canned air will do the most thorough job of removing dust, but you can also use a damp cloth or sponge. If you use a cloth or sponge, be sure to let it dry before moving on in the glazing process., This step is designed to keep glaze off of the bottom of the pot. If there is glaze on the bottom of your pottery it can stick to the kiln shelf during firing.You can buy wax resist products at your local pottery store that can be brushed onto the bottom of your pot, or you can dip the item into a pan of wax. Allow 15 to 20 minutes for the wax to dry.If you don’t want to use wax, you can wipe off any glaze that gets onto the bottom of your pot with a sponge or a metal scraper. Be sure to remove glaze from the foot of the pot, about one-quarter of an inch from the bottom, in case the glaze runs during firing., Plastic buckets or vats are ideal to hold your glaze, but the size of the item and the application method you intend to use can influence your choice of container.


If your item is small enough to dip into the glaze, choose a container that is deep enough to submerge the item completely.
Brushing or sponging requires less glaze, therefore you might use a smaller container., If you bought pre-mixed liquid glaze, pour it into your bucket or vat through a metal sieve to remove any lumps that have formed since it was packaged., Glazes that come as powders have to be mixed with water before use. Pay close attention to the instructions to determine how much water to add.


Adding more or less water than recommended can change the consistency of the glaze. As you become more experienced with glazing you might want to experiment with different consistencies, but the glaze you buy will probably work best by following the instructions listed on the package., Whether you are using liquid or powdered glaze, it will have to be vigorously stirred before use.


If you are using a liquid glaze, a whisk will probably suffice as a stirring tool.If using a powdered glaze, try using a stirring rod attached to a power drill to get the smoothest texture., Apply the mixed glaze to a test piece of pottery. This test piece might be an item you have set aside specifically for this purpose, or it might be a leftover shard from a larger item.


Choose a test piece that closely resembles the item you are finishing. This will provide the most reliable test.
After applying glaze to the test piece, allow it to dry. The glaze will look slightly different dry than wet., Slowly pour glaze into your pot, and swirl the item around to ensure complete coverage., You will probably have poured more into your pot than you need to coat the inside, so you can remove the rest., If there are any spots that the glaze did not reach in the pouring process, fill them in using a brush. You can remove excess glaze using a damp sponge or a paint scraper., If your item is small enough, pick it up with a pair of tongs and dip it straight into the bucket or vat of glaze until it is completely covered, remove it, and then clear excess glaze with a damp sponge, a brush, or a paint scraper.You can buy specialized glazing tongs at a pottery supply store. If your tongs leave marks on the pot, touch them up by brushing them with glaze once you remove your item., If your item is too large to dip into the glaze but small enough to hold over the bucket or vat, you can pour it over the outside of your pot. This will probably result in a thin layer outer layer of glaze., If your item is too large to move during the glazing process, apply the glaze with the tools at hand. Use large brushes to cover the main parts of your pottery, and small brushes or a sponge to fill in the smaller areas.


Don’t dip your tools straight into the buckets or vats of glaze. Put some of your glaze into a a cup or bowl, and dip your brush or sponge into the smaller vessel., Once you have a layer of glaze on your pottery, set it aside to let it dry.


You might want to apply a second layer of glaze to use multiple colors or create designs, but if you do so immediately after the first layer the colors might run together., You can add as many layers of glaze as you want, and mix up your colors as well as your brushing and sponging techniques to create unique designs., If you did not wax your pot, be sure to wipe any glaze off of the bottom with a sponge. If you did wax your pot, remove any glaze that has gotten onto the dried wax., No matter how many layers of glaze you’ve added, you have to wait for the final layer to dry thoroughly before firing your pottery., Though you already fired it in the creation stage before you began the glazing process, you should fire it again once you are done."

Purchase a quality clay.,
Select a porous kneading surface.,
Press the clay.,
Cut the clay.,
Layer the clay.,
Alternate kneading the clay with cutting and layering it until you have kneaded the clay between 50 and 60 times.

,
Check the clay's readiness.",How to Knead Clay," Find a clay that is soft enough to shape with ease. It should be hard enough that it won't stick to your hands when you draw them away from the clay. The clay should be consistent in color.;
, Thick canvas cloth or dry concrete are suitable kneading surfaces. Canvas will keep the clay from sticking to tables and other surfaces. Ensure that the surface is clean, and is at a height that will allow you to be comfortable when pressing down on the clay.,


Throw the clay down forcefully onto the kneading surface.
Bear down on the clay using the weight of your upper body. Do not flatten the clay completely. Push the clay down about halfway to the kneading surface.
Draw the clay towards you. Pull the clay up into a pile.
Push down on the clay until you have flattened it halfway. Ensure that you do not press the clay past the middle section of the lump. Flattening the clay completely may result in air bubbles being trapped in the clay.
Continue to draw and press the clay ten times more.

, Use a clay cutter to slice the lump of clay in half.

,


Slap one cut half of clay forcefully on top of the other. Press the top half of clay into the bottom half. Ensure that you do not leave space where air may get caught between the two halves.
Arrange the halves so that their cut edges are both facing out to the left or right side when pressed together. Aligning the halves of clay will help free the clay of air bubbles. Cutting the clay and rearranging the layers ensures that all parts of the clay mix together evenly.

,, Cut the clay using a clay cutter. Draw your finger over the surface of the cut edge on one of the halves of clay. The clay should be smooth and should display the same texture and color throughout the ball. If there are any rigid or weak spots or obvious lumps, continue kneading the clay before sculpting it.

For example, there are tutorials that can teach you how to make basic jewelry, how to choose the appropriate beads, needles, and thread, and how to complete basic stitches. In order to find a bead weaving tutorial, complete a google search for exactly what you are looking for. Some tutorials will be better than others, so you may need to search around until you find one that works for you.For example, search for ""How to bead weave"", ""How to get started bead weaving"", ""Bead weaving tutorials for beginners."";
, Bead weaving classes are also a great way to learn how to bead weave. In order to find a bead weaving class in your area, go to your local craft store and ask around to find out if there are any available. You can also search online for bead weaving classes. You may even be able to find classes provided online.


Typically a class will focus on a specific skill and item. For example, making a bracelet using a diagonal stitch.

, You can also download a bead weaving pattern online. For example, you could purchase a pattern at the online craft store esty.com or search through a variety of online bead suppliers. Many bead suppliers will also provide free bead weaving patterns that can be downloaded.


Follow the instructions provided with the pattern in order to learn how to make that specific piece.

, Bead weaving needles are different from regular sewing needles because they are much thinner in order to pass through the holes of small beads. They also vary in length. For standard, hand bead weaving it is recommended that you use a needle that is 2 to 2 ¼ inches (5 to 6 cm) long. If you are using a loom, then you will want to use a slightly longer needle that is about 3 inches (7 ½ cm) long.


You can also use needles that are slightly more pliable if you need them to bend when stitching.

, There is also a huge variety of beads available for bead weaving. They come in a number of different colors, shapes, and sizes. In order to select the appropriate type of bead, you need to determine the project you are creating. For example, certain stitches work better with certain beads. A few basic bead types:


Seed beads: Are the most common type of beads and they are typically described as small glass beads.
Cylinder beads: Are uniform in shape and typically have straight sides and large holes. These are the best beads to use if you want to achieve uniform and smooth beadwork.
Cut beads: Are similar in shape to seed beads, however, they have one or more cuts on the side. This gives them a shimmering or sparkling effect similar to a gem.
Hex beads: Are a combination of cylinder beads and cut beads. They have six cuts in them, giving them a more sparkly look.
Drop beads: Are larger beads that look similar to a drop of liquid. They have rounded edges and look best at the end of beaded fringe.
Bugle beads: Are long tubular looking beads and are most commonly used in beaded fringe.

, Beads also come in a variety of sizes. Bead sizes are numbered from size 1 which is an extremely large bead all the way to a size 22 which is a very tiny bead. The most common bead sizes range from size 15 as the smallest to size 6 which is the biggest. Size 11 is typically the most commonly used bead size.Larger beads are best if you have trouble seeing and they are the easiest to use.
Smaller beads are best for intricate detail work.

, In order to prevent tangles and tears, you can lubricate your thread using a conditioner. Some threads will already contain a wax or conditioner. This will be stated on the thread spool. If you are working with a thread that has not been conditioned, place the thread in the conditioner and hold it down with your index finger. Then pull the thread along the conditioner using your other hand. Do this a few times in order to make sure that it is thoroughly conditioned.


Thread conditioner is a waxy-like substance, that can be purchased at a local craft supply store.

, At the beginning of most beading projects, you will need to start by putting on a stopper bead. This will help to hold your beads in place so that they do not fall off the thread. In order to put on a stopper bead, put your beading needle through the hole of the bead and slide it down towards the end of the thread. Before the bead reaches the end of the thread, bring the needle back through the bead from the bottom.This will create a loop around the bead and hold it in place. You can still slide the bead along the thread to position it.

, The ladder stitch is a foundational stitch in bead weaving and is typically used to make the first row of other more complex beading stitches. It can also be used on its own to create jewelry or embellishments. Begin with a stopper bead, and then thread through two additional beads. Bring your needle down and loop back through the bottom of the first bead and pull tight. This will stack the two beads. Then thread down through the top bead to secure it.Thread a third bead onto your needle and then bring your needle down through the second bead. Put the needle through the opposite end of where the thread is hanging out.
Then pull the needle up through the bead that you just added to secure it in place.
Repeat this pattern until you have reached the desired length.

, Once you have mastered the ladder stitch, you can begin learning some other basic stitches. For example, try the brick stitch, the peyote stitch, and the square stitch. Remember to always apply a stopper bead before you begin stitching your beads.

, Once you have reached the end of your thread, you will need to tie if off before continuing your project. To do this, you want to hide the thread within the beads already sewn into the project. Take your needle and sew back through a few rows. Always tie off a thread near the centre of your project, not along the edges. This will make it easier to hide the end of the thread. Loop the thread around a few beads to keep it in place and then cut the thread and tuck it into the project.You should use this same method, regardless of the type of stitch you are completing.
To start up again, take a new thread and loop it around a few beads before stitching through the last bead you were working on. Then continue with your project.

Identify the kind of clay with which you're working.,
Apply any pigments or glazes appropriate for painting on prior to hardening the clay.,
Bake polymer clay and oven-hardening clay in a regular kitchen oven.,
Use patience when waiting for self-hardening clay to harden.,
Schedule time in a professional kiln to harden fine art clay.",How to Harden Modeling Clay," Common kinds of clay include polymer clay (often called oven-hardening clay), self-hardening clay and fine art clay. Since the type of clay has an equally powerful effect on how you build your model, this is something you're better off knowing before you begin your projects.









Polymer clay does not technically contain clay. Instead, it has polymers similar to PVC, with liquids added to make it moldable. It hardens usually in an oven over low heat.
Self-hardening clay is exactly what it sounds like. You mold it, set it aside, and let it harden over the course of several days. Unlike modeling clays, which are oil- or wax-based, and polymer clays, which are resinous, self-hardening clays are water-based.
Fine art clays are usually exactly like self-hardening clays, except that they use high-quality clay and add only water.;
, Some pigments are applied after the clay hardens or in the middle of the hardening process.









It's important to understand these aspects of any coloration prior to starting your project.

, Set a piece of wax paper on top of a baking sheet, cutting it so that it matches the inside dimensions of the sheet.









Most polymer or oven-based clays will harden after they are cooked at 265 °F (129 °C) to 275 °F (135 °C) for 15 minutes per 1⁄4 inch (6.4 mm) of thickness.
Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and place it on a heat-resistant surface. Allow the clay items to cool at room temperature before removing.

, Keep it out of the way and trust time to do its work.









Set the finished model on wax paper on a baking sheet or similar flat and stable surface.
Place the sheet someplace dry, at room temperature and out of direct sunlight. For best results, set it out of the way of other activities. The top of a refrigerator is a good example.Wait 7 to 10 days for the clay to dry completely.

, You can find these facilities at local art stores, community colleges and community centers. If you're not already intimately familiar with how to kiln-harden clay, let the people who run the kiln fire your model.

First you need to glaze your bisque ware using RAKU Glaze.,
Next, load the kiln and bring the temperature up to 1850 degrees.,
You know your ware is ready to pull when it is glowing red and the glaze surface appears shiny and liquid.,
While you're waiting for the glaze to mature, you need to prepare your reduction chambers.

,
Shred newspaper and fill some small metal cans.,
Once the pieces are ready, you're going to need 3 people to do the Raku.,
Person 1 opens the door while Person 2 takes the pieces out one at a time.,
Wait a few minutes for the fires to smother and smoke the pieces.,
THESE PIECES ARE STILL VERY VERY HOT!,
Take the pieces out with tongs and douse them in the bucket of water.,
Done.

",How to Fire Raku Pottery," These glazes have a low melting point so they will mature at cone 06 in about an hour. check out http://members.chello.nl/~c.sleddens/index_bestanden/dewitt-raku-glazuren.htm for a huge list of glaze recipes. ***note: many of these glazes work better of applied in a thin layer***;
, This should take about an hour. If you don't know how to fire a kiln, you should have an experienced potter help you.


If you are using pyrometric cones or a pyrometer, skip this step.~~ Check on the ware every 15 minutes or so after you've been firing for about 45 minutes. You're looking for bubbling in the glaze. Once it starts bubbling, you're about 15 minutes away from ""Raku Time!""

, Matt glazes are more difficult to read, so fall back on your cones/pyrometer reading if you need to.

,, The cans should only be a little bigger than the pieces you want to put in them, the smaller the better to create a good reduction and lots of pretty color!

, (1)One to open the door, (2)one to pull the pieces out with tongs and place them in the cans, and (3)one to close the can lids. Each person should have a set of Raku gloves and appropriate eye protection. You may also want to wear dust masks as it's gonna get smoky!

, The door should be closed between pulls to retain heat. Place the pieces as quickly as possible into the waiting cans. Person 3 should wait for the newspaper to catch fire, then fit the lids on securely to smother the fire and smoke the pieces. **Note, always try to turn bowls upside down so the inside gets better color**

, Good cans shouldn't release too much smoke when covered, so be careful when you open them up. Keep your face away from the openings as you take off the lids. Also watch out for back drafts.

, Any remaining newspaper will begin to burn again once air is introduced back into the can. You can pour some water into the cans to put them out and cool the ware.

, **DO NOT DO THIS TO BOTTLES*** Bottles will explode if you douse them, allow bottles to cool naturally.

Gather your diya and supplies.,
Clean your diya.,
Array your paint for application.,
Apply your base coat.,
Add design to your backdrop.,
Include finishing touches.,
Give the contours of your diya definition.",How to Decorate a Diya1," If you have multiple diya that you wish to decorate, you should gather the lamps together so you can paint these in sequence, and by having all your tools and supplies handy, you can save yourself time and effort. For this project you'll need:


Acrylic paints (assorted colors)
Bucket or tub
Diya(s)
Clear epoxy/shellac (optional; non-flammable)
Glitter (optional)
Glue (non-flammable)
Paintbrushes
Plastic plate or palette
Stiff bristle brush;
, If your diya is not fully cleaned, your paint might darken or your brush might gunk up, giving you an effect you hadn't intended or wanted! To clean your diya, soak it in a bucket or tub filled with warm water for about an hour, and then scrub it with your stiff bristle brush.Before adding any paint to your diya, you should allow it to dry completely.

, Pour a moderate amount of the colors you are planning to use to paint your diya onto your plastic plate or palette. From among those colors, choose one to be your base coat. Once you have decided on your base coat, you may want to add a little extra paint, as this will be spread over the entire surface of your diya lamp.

, Now that you have your colors at the ready and your lamp is clean and dry, you can begin painting. Take your brush and dip it into your base coat color and spread this color over the entire surface of your diya.


The clay of your diya lamp will likely absorb much of the paint you apply, so you may have to wait for your base coat to dry and then add another layer to your base.While waiting for your base coat to dry, you might consider starting the base coat for another diya.
Using a light color as the base coat may give more contrast to your later designs, causing these to pop.

, Diwali is a popular religious festival that incorporate the use of the Diya in celebration of light's triumph over darkness.In this spirit, you may want to incorporate symbolic representations of light and dark, like sun and moon, or the stars shining brightly on a field of dark blue.


The use of metallic colors, such as silver, gold, and copper, will give your diya a richer, more sophisticated appearance.

, It is likely that your diya lamp will be lit at some point, so you may want to think about adding light reflective effects to it. Glitter and sequins might catch the gentle light of this small lamp and glitter softly, adding extra appeal to your decorative paint.Use your glue in small amounts to adhere your reflective materials. If you are working with fine material, like glitter, you may want to use a clear epoxy/varnish, like shellac. Apply a thin layer of your clear epoxy with a brush, then sprinkle or blow your glitter onto it.
Paint your epoxy in patters and then apply your glitter to create specific effects, like swirls and shapes.
Use glitter to give celestial designs the appearance of twinkling.

, Painting the edges of your lamp a darker color, like black or dark brown, will give its natural shape more definition. Applied delicately, this can give your diya an elegant aesthetic."

Start with a soft bit of clay.,
Roll the piece of clay into a long, snake shape.

,
Cut the snake shape into equal parts.,
Roll each piece of clay into a ball.,
Using your fingers, shape each ball into a cube.,
Use a pen, or other slender-tipped object, (even a stick will work) to write dots or the numbers 1-6 on each die, as follows:

""1"" and ""6"" are placed opposite one other.,
Place the completed die or dice on a baking sheet.,
Allow to cool.",How to Make Clay Dice," The piece of clay must be equivalent to the size that you want your dice to be.;
,, Discard any pieces that are not equal in size.

, Make one ball for each die. The ball does not need to be perfect.

, Squeeze the top and bottom, then left and right sides, then front and back sides. Repeat this squeezing process until the piece of clay resembles a perfect cube.

,






""2"" and ""5"" are placed opposite one other.






""3"" and ""4"" are placed opposite one other.






Simply remember the number placement like this: the numbers opposite each other equal 7. (1+6=7; 2+5=7, etc.)







, Bake in a low-temperature oven; 250ºF or 121ºC is a good, low temperature. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until properly baked.

, The die will still seem a little soft while hot; just leave them to harden on a cooling rack and only touch when they've cooled off completely. Once cooled, they're ready to use.

Choose a suitable colorant for the clay.,
Knead the color through the clay.",How to Color Air Dry Clay1," A lot of air-drying clay comes in white. To change white clay to any preferred color, mix small amounts of water-based paints, oil paints, acrylic paint (artist's quality), pastel chalks or poster paints with the clay before modeling. Food-grade colorants can be used too; for example, you can try cake coloring in paste or gel forms (not liquid), while colored drink mix is another option.


Always test a small piece of white clay first, to determine how the color will work and to get the hue you're after.;
, Soften the clay first by working with it, then add the colorant gradually while kneading. This will ensure that the color is distributed evenly throughout the whole piece of clay you'll be using, and by adding the colorant slowly, you can determine when enough color has been added.


Work on a surface that can either be disposed of or can be washed easily, such as a layer of wax paper over the counter-top or a plastic cutting board.

Accumulate your bricolage tools.,
Prepare your vessel.,
Prime your diya.,
Apply your epoxy.,
Attach your bric-a-brac to your diya.,
Highlight features with glitter.",How to Decorate a Diya2," This includes any other diya that you may have lying around itching for eye catching design. Bricolage is art that is constructed from a wide range of available material, and can set your diya apart from the rest.For this decorative endeavor, you will want to have:


Acrylic paints (assorted colors)
Bucket or tub
Diya(s)
Clear epoxy/shellac (non-flammable)
Glass beads (optional)
Glitter (optional)
Glue (non-flammable)
Paintbrushes
Small knick-knacks and bric-a-brac
Small pebbles and stones
Stiff bristle brush

, Dirtiness can ruin the bond made by your epoxy and make your bricolage design loose or delicate. You should clean your diya by soaking it in a bucket or tub filled with warm water. Do this for about an hour, and then scrub it with your stiff bristle brush.Before adding any paint to your diya, you should allow it to dry completely.

, You can do so by painting a base of paint over all surfaces of your diya. This will give a uniform base color and an even surface for your paint to bond with. Choosing a strong base color, like red or gold, can also give the items you glue to your lamp appeal.


Allow your priming layer of paint to dry completely before moving on. If your priming layer does not look consistent, you may want to paint another layer to give it a uniform look.

, Using a brush, apply your epoxy to a small section of your diya. You don't want to paint on too much adhesive; doing so will waste it, as it is likely to dry before you can attach your knick-knacks to your lamp.

, Colored stones, glass beads, and other like material can be stuck to the area you have painted with glue in interesting shapes and designs. Be prepared to move quick, as the glue will begin drying as soon as it's applied.

, When your bricolage design is finished and dry, you may want to consider adding depth to your artistic diya with some glitter. Aim for parts of your design that have natural prominence and further bring these out with an application of glitter."

Incorporate rangoli into your diya designs.,
Paint the portrait of Lakshmi.,
Try to create a vermilion color for your diya.",How to Decorate a Diya3," You might want to inscribe your name inside the reservoir of your diya. Using a gold or silver paint will give your name a glittering effect under the glow of your lit lamp! If you have some other kind of mark or symbol that you identify with, this would be a distinguishing addition to your diya.

, Ganesha is a divine being in the Hindu religious pantheon who is revered during Diwali. So you may want to paint his symbol, the swastika, on your diya. By putting doubled lines on the outer sides of your swastika, you can add the Shubh Labh symbol, which represents good and profit., This symbol is representative of beauty, growth, and the formation of the universe, which makes it a fitting symbol for Diwali. You might want to draw your eight-petal lotus in its traditional form, or you could try to use geometric designs based in this traditional pattern., Rangoli is a kind of folk art commonly made during Diwali. This type of art intended to bring good luck, and also is symbolic of many traditional stories.You can even use your rangoli decorated diya as part of a larger rangoli design.

, This goddess in the Hindu pantheon is the symbol of wealth and prosperity.She is a common symbol during Diwali, and is a great way to personalize your diya lamp., Vermilion might be a difficult color for you to replicate, but this opaque orange is very common during Diwali.By painting your diya this hue, you'll convey the classic feelings associated with this color to all who see it!

, The figurines must be solid, to avoid accidentally breaking off anything that hasn't yet set. Wet clay might also cause the watercolors to run.

, This will prevent the marker ink from running on the clay background.

,, You can use the watercolor pens to add on typical clothing features, such as buttons, zippers, shoelaces, patches, hoodie toggles, etc.

, Draw patterns to bring clothing to life. For example, stripes, spots, flowers, shapes, etc. can be drawn on clothing items to make the figurine more interesting.

, You can draw eyes, the mouth and nose using the watercolor marker.

, Use the watercolor markers to make fur features on animal figurines, such as black and white patches on a cow, spots on a leopard or tabby stripes on a cat.

, For example, you could draw knobs and switches on machines, draw a scene for a dollhouse picture or TV set, draw pieces of food on a miniature plate or design a cover for a miniature clay book.

, Use a varnish or other appropriate sealant as recommended by the manufacturer to create a protective layer over the top of the artwork.

Unless you have access to powdered chalk, you would probably need to grind your own chalk.,
Top up the chalk with baby powder to an amount desired, while trying to keep the ratio of chalk to baby powder roughly around 2:3.,
Pinch off a ball of paper clay approximately a sixth of the chalk-baby powder mix.,
Dissolve the desired colour acrylic paint into the slip thoroughly.,
Mix the chalk and baby powder with a portion of the coloured slip you have.,
Mould the mixture to the desired shape and set it to dry in a warm place.,
Shape the rock by chiseling, grinding etc.

,
Polish the stone if desired by rubbing it onto paper.,
You can also paint the finished rock to look like granite by applying a series of light misting layers of paint in complimentary colors.","How to Contrive Soft, Non Waterproof Artificial Stones"," Using any flat object with a suitably sharp edge (such as a metal ruler), rub the chalk across the edge to produce a fine grained powder. Break a piece of chalk off and cleave it into small pieces.;
, More chalk would make the resultant rock harder and brittle, while more baby powder would make the rock softer.

, Convert it to slip by dissolving it in water. Now you should have obtained a thick milky white liquid.

, Remember that the colour of the stone would lighten dramatically when dry.

, Knead the mixture. If the mixture is crumbly, add more slip. If its too watery, leave the mixture to dry for some time.

, Avoid direct sunlight and extreme heat as it would cause the mixture to crack.

,, Initially, the rock would be worn downed and powder would be produced. However, as time passes, the powder would be compacted into the paper's pores to form a smooth, shiny surface. At around the same time, the rock's surface would start to darken and shine too.

, Ideally you will water down the paint with water at a ratio of three parts water to one part pain and apply the mixture with a spray bottle. Light layers of different colors with time to dry between each layer will create an exact likeness to real granite.

Remove excess moisture or water.,
Make a large slab of plaster.,
Feel the clay.,
Knead water into mildly dry clay.,
Dampen and let extremely dry clay sit.",How to Extend the Usability of Clay," If you have wet clay from using it on a pottery wheel or because you got it too wet, then you first try to drain out any water from the clay. Sometimes if you squish it the water comes out so that it's more usable.

, Once it dries, you can use it to remove excess moisture from clay so that you can use it over and over.

, How dry is it? If it's really dry (like at the leather stage where it's about the consistency of hard cheese) then you're going to need to approach it differently as apposed to something that's mildly dry.;
, If your clay is mildly dry, just work some water into it by kneading it like dough. Usually that makes any semi-dried clay that you used before into nice usable clay.

, If your clay is really bad and leather hard, then you should coat it with water all over and cover it in a very thoroughly soaked towel or paper towel. Let the clay sit there for a bit before you try to work some water into it.

Choose a suitable dough.,
Make peas in a pod.,
Make carrots or parsnips.,
Make garlic.,
Make a new potato.,
Make a radish.,
Make a cherry tomato.,
Continue shaping vegetables in the same manner outlined in these suggested vegetables.",How to Make Dough Vegetables," There are different types of dough that you can use for the modeling. Some of the favorites include:


Bread dough
Salt dough

See wikiHow's dough section for more ideas.;
,


Roll a piece of dough to 6.5 centimeter (2.6 in) long by 12mm in diameter for the pea pod. Aim for a fish-like shape.
Hollow the center of the dough into a boat shape using the handle of a teaspoon.
Pinch the ends into points for the stalk and the tip of the pod.
Roll some graded-sized balls to imitate peas and fill the pod with them. It will probably help to moisten the base of each pea slightly to ensure that it adheres properly.

,


Roll a piece of dough into a tube 9.5 centimeter (3.7 in) long by 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) in diameter, then pinch in at one end to form the root tip or the carrot or parsnip.
Cut a small piece of dough with scissors to simulate the cut leaves and attach them to the top with a dab of water to moisten. Alternatively, push green dough through a garlic press to make the leafy top of carrots.

,


Model six to eight curved tubes of dough about 3 centimeter (1.2 in) long and 12mm wide for each garlic segment.
Form the inner stem of the bulb from a piece of dough about 4 centimeter (1.6 in) long and slightly wider at the base.
Fix the segments around the stem with a dab of water to moisten, leaving the stem protruding above the segments for about 12mm.

,


Form a piece of dough into an irregular oval shape 5 centimeter (2.0 in) long by 3 centimeter (1.2 in) in diameter to resemble a new potato. Randomly indent the surface of the dough with the point of a kitchen knife to form the eyes of the potato.

,


Roll a ball of dough into 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) in diameter, then pinch one end into a point to form the root tip.
Cut a small piece of dough with scissors to simulate the cut leaves at the top end and attach them to the top of the radish with a dab of water to moisten.

,


Roll a ball of dough to 4 centimeter (1.6 in) in diameter.
Pinch a scrap of dough into a star shape about 3 centimeter (1.2 in) in diameter, wet the base and press it on the top of the ball, forming the calyx.
Fix a 2 centimeter (0.8 in) long stem in the middle of the calyx with a dab of water.

, Once you've grasped the basic method for making them, it becomes easy to use images of other vegetables to guide your modeling so that you can shape any style of vegetable. Some things to be aware of when modeling with dough include:

Know whether you need to color the dough before using it or after it has dried. In some cases, you may need to do both but be aware that in most cases, it is easier to dye the dough before using it to model with. Usually food coloring is the dye of choice but some craft paints will work well for surface coloring and details.
Use different colored dough for different areas of the vegetables, such as leaves, the flesh, the skin, etc. If dying the dough, dye smaller batches of colors for leaves and seeds, to avoid wasting dough.
Display the food as it would be if it were real. Find miniature plates/trays/bowls, etc. (bottle tops, card circles, baskets, etc. from your recycling are ideal) and glue in place. Use your imagination for making the display items from recyclables.

Consider using scrap canvas.,
Try decorative bands.,
Look for pre-manufactured items with Evenweave cloth already sewn in place awaiting stitching.,
Use gingham.",How to Find Alternatives to Even Weave Fabric for Embroidery Projects," Scrap canvas is a clever way of working on uneven fabric using a ""temporary grid"" formed by the scrap canvas. This can be a great way to add an embroidered design to something made of heavier fabric, such as a canvas backpack. This is done by selecting single weave canvas and basting it onto the uneven weave fabric.


Work the design following your pattern over both the scrap canvas and the uneven fabric. When you have finished embroidering the pattern onto the fabric, remove the basting from the scrap canvas.
Carefully trim the scrap canvas away. Do not cut any cross stitches.
Move from one corner first and carefully draw out the strands of scrap canvas in a single direction. Once all of these strands have been removed, move to the opposite corner and pull out all of the strands that run in the other direction.
This requires delicate finger movements and small scissors, so if you don't feel as if you can do it without cutting the thread, either ask someone else more nimble to finish it off for you, or use a different method outlined here.;
, You can purchase even-weave fabric from spools at craft stores and these can be purchased in any lengths desired. While still even-weave, these provide a different creative approach to your embroidery project by offering a very limited canvas space that can be applied to a very wide array of existing items, such as pillow cases, sheets, hairbands, towel edges, face washers, bibs, clothing, curtains, aprons, etc.

, This might include shirts or jackets with an Evenweave pocket or sleeve edges already sewn in place but awaiting embroidering. Bibs are often done in this style when sold in craft stores.

, Gingham is great for adding cross-stitch designs because it has squares in place as the natural formation of the fabric. Work the stitches using a chart, following the squares of the gingham as guidance. Naturally, smaller gingham squares are far easier as the size of the stitches will be determined by the size of the checks.

Set the machine up and allow it to embroider your design.,
Remove the towel from the hoop.,
Trim away the water-soluble topper.,
Trim the cutaway stabilizer away.,
Finish it up.",How to Embroider Terrycloth Towels," Avoid towels that have patterns on them, such as damask or stripes. They will compete with your embroidered design and make it harder to see.


If your design is dark-colored, choose a light-colored towel.
If your design is light-colored, go for a dark-colored towel.;
, This is important, especially if the towel is brand new. Terrycloth towels are made out of cotton, which will shrink the first time you wash it. You want to get rid of any shrinking before you add the embroidery.

, You can use an existing design on your embroidery machine, purchase and download one online, or create your own using an embroidery-design program. Thicker, heavier designs work better than light, delicate ones. Great embroidery designs include:


Flowers and birds
Monograms
Damask and filigree
Celtic knots and Chinese knots

, This will be your template. If you can't print your design, get the length and width of it, and draw a rectangle onto a sheet of paper according to those measurements. Cut the rectangle out.

, A good way to find the center and axis on your template is to fold it into fourths, then to use the creases as your guides. Pin the template to your towel where you want the design to go, and make a small mark on the towel using a tailor's pen. Remove the template when you are done.

, Spray the back of a sheet of cutaway stabilizer with removable adhesive. Press the stabilizer against the back of your towel, right where the design is.

, Take the hoop from your embroidery machine. Set the inner hoop down first, then place the towel on top, stabilizer-side-down. Press the outer hoop down on top.


Machine hoops are a little different from the standard embroidery hoop.

, Make sure that the excess towel is out of the way so that it won't get caught in the needle.

, This will prevent the embroidery from sinking into the terrycloth. It will dissolve when you wash the towel. If you'd like to, you can run a basting stitch around the inside of the hoop to keep the topper in place., Use a size 11 or 75/11 sharp sewing needle. You could also use an embroidery needle instead.Make sure that all of your threads are in place.

, Even though embroidery machines are automatic, you still want to watch it from time to time to make sure that it is behaving properly. This is especially important if you are working with metallic threads.


Each machine is different. How you set things up will depend on the type of machine you have. Refer to your machine's manual.

, Once the machine is done embroidering, remove the hoop and snip off the excess thread. Pull apart the hoop and remove the towel. If you used basing stitches earlier, you will need to remove those first.

, Use a small pair of scissors to carefully trim the topper away from around your design. Again, don't worry if it's not perfect. It will dissolve when you wash it.

, Leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) boarder) all around the design.Alternatively, you can also tear it away, but be aware that this may snap some threads and ruin your embroidered design.

, Use a small pair of scissors to trim down any jump threads.Consider pressing the design with a hot iron. This will help set the stitches.If you'd like to, you can rinse away the water-soluble topper now, or wait until the next time you have to do laundry.

Repeat from * in the next four meshes.,
Keep the direction in mind.,
Continue until pattern completed.",How to Embroider the Kloster Stitch (Hardanger)," Choose the fabric wisely. You may opt for a good quality cotton material, pure linen or a mixed fabric. This will assist you in being aware of the fabric type and its use accordingly.
, For clarity and accuracy, you may make square shapes on the fabric with a colored chalk to guide you through the stitches with directions. The couching thread which sits first on the fabric is sewn on with another thread. Thus forming a pattern gradually as you progress.

You must make sure that all the laid threads be parallel to each other for Kloster stitching.

If the laid thread is vertical, keep all the read of the laid threads placed vertically. If you start off with the laid thread horizontally, continue with all the laid thread horizontally.


To hold the fabric well in your hands, you may also use an embroidery hoop. This hoop will fix and hold the fabric open and free from creases.

, You must secure the thread initially. For that you may make a knot at the back of the fabric. You may start off at the bottom left corner. You must follow this thread as it is the first couching thread., The couching stitch would make the outline of the final stitch or design. For this you may lay down the couching thread and fasten it with upper stitches., It portrays the kloster stitch process being worked around a square or ""box"" shape. The stitch in the middle is the ""lace stitch"" (see below for instructions). Use the image to guide your sewing action.,,, Lay them evenly together., Kloster stitch is directed according to your choice of thread twisting. It could either be in a 'S' or 'Z' twisting pattern., Note that the lace stitch (pictured above) is not worked until the threads of the fabric are cut and drawn from the little squares made by the kloster stitch. The lace stitch is made by working in a single buttonhole stitch in the center mesh of each of the 4 sides of the kloster block.

To make sure the stitch is going well, maintain the thread work firm. It should not be too tight with no space nor should it be too loose with extra thread puffing up. Maintain just about the perfect pull while making Kloster stitches.

",How to Embroider by Hand," You’ll need to carefully consider what fabric you want to embroider. This can be a complex decision. For beginners, it’s a good idea to start with a basic, white or light colored cotton or canvas fabric. As you learn and experiment with different materials, you’ll have to keep some other things in mind as well:


Choose a fabric that compliments the item that the embroidery will be on.
Choose a firm fabric with a good thread count (28 or higher), especially if the design will involve heavy items like ribbon or buttons.;
, First things first, for serious projects make sure you’re getting embroidery floss and not “craft thread” or similar looking products. These are ill suited to embroidery because the thread is much lower quality and the color can bleed. However, for small test projects and learning exercises, it can be perfectly useful and more economical.


You’ll also want to adjust the weight (thread count) of the floss to the level of detail you’re trying to create. The more detailed the project, the thinner the floss should be. The more bold the design, the thicker the floss should be.
Don’t worry too much about the type of embroidery floss you buy. There are many types but generally of the thinner threads, the only impact is on the final look (whether it comes out shiny or more matte in finish). Beginners shouldn’t worry about this.
Be careful not to buy embroidery thread, since this is designed to be used with a machine.

, For your first, basic projects you’ll want to get a basic embroidery needle. A size 12-18 needle is a good starting point for canvas embroidery. Some needles have sharp points while others have blunt points but for beginners, a sharp point will get you through most starting projects.

, You’ll need an embroidery hoop of a reasonable size for your design. You’ll also need a method of transferring your design onto the fabric (discussed in the following section). There are also other helpful extras like thimbles and needle threaders that can make your life much easier (and less painful!).

, When you’re first starting, it’s a good idea to stick to something as basic as possible. Go for clean lines, not too much area to be filled, and larger shapes. It takes awhile to develop the dexterity to do detailed, fine work, so go with these basic designs for now.


Good beginner shapes include: flowers, stars, and simple line art.
You can find designs online or you can draw or trace one of your own.

, You’ll have to decide on a method for applying the design you found or made onto your fabric. For beginners working with simple fabrics, tracing is probably the easiest. You can also get iron on transfers, but these tend to leave the design looking fuzzy, so be aware of that. If you’re brave, you can draw the design freehand.


You can also try things like water-soluble fabric, which allows you to trace or print the design onto the temporary fabric and embroider directly onto it with the backing fabric underneath.
Stencils are also a good option when you’re first learning how to embroider, especially since those designs tend to be simple.

, Before you can continue, you need to know what goes where in your design. What areas will be filled? What color will they be? What sections are in the background vs foreground? This is crucial in making sure that your project goes smoothly. Not planning ahead is like getting in car without a map and just expecting to end up in New York City.

, Embroidery hoops—which you should not skip on—are formed by two wooden circles with a clasp that holds them together. The inner circle goes on the backside of your fabric and the outer circle goes on the front side that you will be embroidering. Fit them together and then tighten the screw holding the frames together.


You’ll want to be extra sure that the fabric is taut. This is the point of the hoop after all!

, Cut a length of floss to embroider with. The floss’s length will depend on how much area you want to embroider, what kind of stitches you’re doing, and how thick the floss and fabric are. Generally, you do not want the doubled up thread to be longer than your arm, since this will be a pain to have to pull, but you can do it if the project calls for that much continuous thread.

, Thread the floss onto the embroidery needle, just like how you’d thread a normal sewing needle. This is why using an embroidery needle is important though: the eye is much longer to accommodate the extra threads. However, unlike sewing, you won’t double up the entire length of the thread. Instead, you will only double up part of it, leaving a long tail to embroider with and a short tail of about 3” that will be extra.

, Before you put the thread to fabric, it’s important to understand where the threads are going to go. In embroidery, you generally want to start with background items and move forward, as parts of the design get closer to you. This is so that you can overlap your stitches between colors and sections to create depth.

, Before you start stitching, you’ll need to create some kind of stopper to keep the floss from coming right back out of the fabric. When you’re first starting, making a knot at the end of the long tail is probably easiest. As you get more skilled, you’ll want to switch to using a waste knot, since this will keep extra bulk to a minimum.

, When you do finally start your stitches, it’s a good idea to start at a joint or corner. This will create a more natural, flowing look. Look for spots where one object touches another. If your design is very basic, like a circle, you just have to pick a spot and start.

, When you work on projects, you of course want to dive right in and get to the fun! But it’s a good idea to do a test section with the combination of fabric, needle, and floss that you will be using. This allows you to make sure that the final product looks good and you have the size of all of the various parts adjusted correctly.


Satin stitches make good test stitches.

, When you've got down the basics, you want to work towards making your more even, clean, and aligned. Very even stitching is generally considered the mark of a good embroiderer. This is a skill that comes through practice and you will get it with time. Just be sure to pay attention and aim to have even stitches.

, As you get better, you’ll want to take on more and more interesting projects. These usually require fine, detailed stitches however. You’ll need to work on your dexterity, aim, and eye in order to do the really fine embroidery that the seasoned pros do. Like even stitches, this is a skill that comes from practice, so make an effort.

, As with any craft, it’s very important to start slow and really work your way up to more complex pieces. If you try to take on too much right at the beginning, it’s easy to get frustrated or feel like you can’t learn how to do it...which isn’t true. You can do this! Just keep trying!

If you really want your embroidery to stand out, make sure to choose napkins that don’t have any other designs or patterns. You can embroider any color napkins, but make sure to consider the color of thread you’ll be using. By using light-colored napkins with dark threads and vice versa, you can ensure that your embroidery is clearly visible., When it comes to embroidery, this step is crucial. If you’re a beginner, it can be a daunting task to sort through the colors, let alone types, of thread that a craft store offers. For napkins, the common, cotton embroidery floss will work perfectly. It can be helpful to hold the embroidery floss against the napkins you will be embroidering to determine which colors you need. Grab some embroidery needles, and you’re all set.If you have difficulty threading the embroidery floss through the small eye of the needle, consider purchasing a needle threader as well. This is a handy contraption that can make this task much easier.

, An embroidery hoop is an invaluable tool when it comes to embroidering napkins. It is a simple hoop that will clamp down on the napkin to hold it flat and taut, ensuring your embroidery is even and smooth.These hoops come in different sizes depending on the size of the fabric and design that you’re working with. Make sure to purchase a hoop that can fit your design and can also fit into the size of the napkin.

, When you’re deciding what to embroider onto your napkin, look for inspiration. If you are embroidering napkins to give as gifts, consider embroidering them with the recipient’s name or initials. If you’re embroidering napkins for a holiday party, consider holiday-themed designs. Check out the Internet, magazines, and patterns at the craft store to get an idea.When you’re choosing a design, keep your skill level in mind. An experienced embroiderer may be able to create an intricate Thanksgiving turkey, but a beginner may want to stick to initials.

, Before you start stitching away on your fabric, it’s important to perfect the design. You can handwrite the text or draw the design on paper, and you can also use the computer. You can find simple patterns online by doing a Google search, or you can use interesting fonts to create the text. Make sure to print it out the same size that you want the design. You will be transferring this exact design to the fabric, so make sure you get it exactly how you want it!, Once you’re satisfied with the design you’ve created on paper, it’s time to transfer it to the napkin. This is where your transfer paper comes in. Place the carbon transfer on top of the napkin, and then place your design on top of it. Using a pen, pencil, or any pointed object, trace over the design on the regular paper.As you trace the design on your paper, you will be pressing the design into the transfer paper, which will in turn transfer your design to the napkin.
It’s important that the paper and transfer paper do not shift during this step. If you need to, tape the paper and transfer paper to the napkins so they don’t budge.

, This is easiest to do after you’ve transferred your design to the napkin. Different hoops have different ways of holding the napkin, but all that matters is that there are no ripples in the fabric. The cloth should be held taut, with the design inside the hoop. Consider your hoop to be your easel – it holds your canvas up so that you can create your masterpiece.If you don’t have an embroidery hoop or simply don’t want to use one, you can embroider your design without it. Just take extra care to make sure that you hold your napkin evenly and tightly so that there are no bulges or ripples in the finished embroidery.

, Finally, you’re ready for the fun part. Grab your embroidery floss, and pull the end through the eye of the needle. This is where the needle threader may come in handy, if you have one. Otherwise, use a steady hand to slip the floss through the small opening in the needle. Pull a couple inches of thread through, so that it won’t easily slip back out as you’re working.


The thread should be long enough to trace your design, but not too long that it will get tangled and in your way.
Tie a knot at the end of your thread. This will be the “stopper” that keeps your thread from sliding all the way through the cloth.

, To start, poke your needle through the backside of the napkin. The needle should emerge at the very beginning of your design. Pull your thread all the way through the fabric. Keep pulling until you feel the knot against the fabric, stopping your thread.


It’s important to pull your thread all the way through the fabric with each stitch so that you don’t accidentally create any knots.

, About half a centimeter from where your needle came through, poke it back through the fabric the opposite way. This will create your first stitch. Again, make sure to pull your thread completely through the fabric.

, After you’ve pulled your thread through and have created your first stitch, you’ll begin the process of backstitching. Poke your needle back through the fabric from the backside, one stitch length away from the first one. Pull the thread through. Then, poke your needle at the same point that the first stitch ended, and pull your thread through.In other words, you are creating a stitch backwards to connect it to the first stitch – hence the name backstitch!
Continue poking the needle up through the napkin one stitch length away, connecting it to the prior stitch, and so on until you’ve filled in your entire traced design.

, After you’ve completed embroidering your design, you need to tie off the end of your thread. Keep your needle threaded to make this process a bit easier. Tie the end of the thread around some of the stitching on the backside of the napkin. Then, run your needle through some of these stitches to camouflage the loose tail of the thread. Use your embroidery scissors to trim any excess thread."

, Unscrew the outer hoop enough so that you can pull it off. Center your fabric over the inner hoop, then place the outer hoop back on top. Screw the outer hoop shut slowly, occasionally tugging on the edges of the fabric to keep it taut. Once the fabric is taut, tighten the outer hoop the rest of the way.


You can use any type of fabric, but a loosely-woven fabric, such as cotton or linen, will work much better than a tightly woven one, such as satin.

, The type of needle you use will depend on the type of thread you are using. If you plan on using embroidery thread or embroidery floss, you should use an embroidery or tapestry needle. You can, however, use yarn for a larger project. In that case, use a sharp, yarn needle.

, Make sure that the final stitch goes downward, through the fabric, and out through the back. You can use a chain stitch or a backstitch for this.Alternatively, you can also do a simple straight stitch. In this case, start from the center of your web, stitch all the way to the end of the spoke, then stitch all the way back down to the center.

, Bring the needle up through the fabric fight at the start of the second spoke. Stitch along the second spoke using the same stitch as you did on the first one: chain stitch or backstitch.

, You have just finished your first two spokes.

, You will be stitching two spokes before knotting and cutting the thread. If you have an odd number of spokes, simply do the last spoke at the end, and tie the thread off at the center of the web, behind the fabric.

, Start with the upper-right spoke. Thread your needle, and push it up through the fabric, on the left side of the spoke. You can use the same color of thread, or a contrasting one.

, Pull the thread over your first spoke towards the next one. Bring the thread past the second spoke, and push the needle through the fabric, just to the right of the spoke.

, Your needle should now be behind your work. Push the needle back up through the fabric, just to the left of the second spoke. You have wound the thread around the spoke, holding it against the fabric.

, Starting from the left side of the spoke, bring the needle over to the right side of the next spoke. Push the needle through the fabric, and pull it back up through the left side of the spoke.When you finish the first ring, tie the thread into a knot behind the fabric, and snip off the excess.

, Once your spider web is done, you can take the fabric out of the embroidery hoop, and use it for your project. Alternatively, you can leave the fabric in the hoop, and use the hoop as a frame. Here is how you can turn your embroidery into a framed artwork:Take the fabric out of the hoop, and paint the hoop a matching or contrasting color.
Let the paint dry, then put the fabric back into the hoop, making sure that it is pulled taut.
Trim off the excess fabric, about ½-inch (1.27-centimeters) away from the hoop.
Fold the excess fabric onto the inner hoop and secure it with hot glue or fabric glue.
Thread some ribbon through the screw on the outer hoop, and tie it into a loop.

The dots should only be an inch (2.54 centimeters) or so from the center dot. This stitch is a type of embroidery stitch, and is often used as a filler.

, Thick, chunky thread, such as pearl cotton works great for this part, but you can use any type of embroidery thread or floss you want., Starting from the back of your work, pull the needle and thread up through your first outer dot. Next, bring the thread down through the center dot and out through the back of the fabric., Bring the needle back up to the second outer dot. Push the needle through the fabric, and out the front of your work. Bring the needle back down through the center dot. Keep doing this until you have connected all of the outer dots to the center dot.

, It does not matter between which two spokes you start., Slide your needle under the first spoke, then pull the thread through it. It should end up between the next two spokes. Make sure that the needle does not go through the fabric. Pull the thread taut., Pull the thread back towards the first spoke. Push the needle under the spoke, and pull the thread through it. Give it a gently tug. Once again, do not push the needle through the fabric.This will create a loop around the first spoke.

, Pull the needle unde rthe second spoke. Bring it over the spoke, and then back under it. Proceed onto the next spoke. Keep doing this until all of the spokes have been connected.From time to time, use the tip of your needle to push the loops and connecting lines towards the center. Sometimes, the connecting lines will slide askew, and this will keep them neat, tidy, and even., You can also end the connecting lines halfway or even two-thirds of the way.


Consider switching colors every few rings. This will give your web some more variation.

, Pull the thread though the fabric, right next to your last spoke. Tie the thread into a tight knot, then trim off the excess."

Prepare the fabric if needed.",How to Choose Embroidery Fabric," The fabric must be able to support the overall weight of your project. A lightweight fabric will likely pull and stretch if it has heavy yarn, beading and ribbon on it. A heavier weight fabric would be needed for a design involving wool, beading and similar heavier stitching mediums. For example, a design featuring a bunch of ribbon embroidered flowers would be heavier than a design of simple cross stitched flowers. If items such as buttons, bows, beading or other extraneous elements are to be added, you will need strong fabric that can hold its shape well.


For example, a delicate and lightweight fabric would work best for whitework, while a heavier fabric would be ideal for a long-stitch with wool.;
, The fabric must be able to support the weight and width of the thread you are using. When selecting the fabric, bear in mind the following:


The fabric should not permit the thread to show through to the front of your project. The only exception to this is where you are deliberately wanting this effect but that is a rare occurrence.
A delicate thread can be lost in a too heavy a fabric, while a heavy thread can cause a fragile fabric to pull apart or dominate the fabric too much.
The weave of the fabric must be able to withstand the pressure of the thread's width passing through it (explained next).

, The weave of the fabric must be strong enough to hold the threads in place and not be too overwhelming for the threads. Be alert to ""thread count"". This refers to the fabric's weave and determines the ability of the fabric to permit a needle to thread through it without difficulty. It is much easier to do a stitching project on fabric with loose weave than one with tight weave. Fabrics with loose weave include cotton, muslin, linen, Aida (used most often for cross-stitch or embroidering projects rather than as a clothing or sewing fabric) and even some repurposed fabrics as flour and feed sacks. You are looking for the lower thread count; if you want to understand this better, think about how high thread count is considered valuable for sheets––such a fabric would make it hard to embroider on the fabric.


Looser weaves will be less able to hold the threads but will be ideal for larger threads. Cotton, Aida, wool and linen are close weaves that are suitable for embroidery with thread or ribbon.
Full weave fabrics usually allow you to do stitching that doesn't show holes or gaps between the stitching. For many projects, this is an important requirement for neatness and continuity.
Tighter woven, fine fabric such as silk or voile may be more suitable if you're doing thread painting style embroidery, allowing you to highlight all of the stitches clearly.
Some fabrics will ""drown"" a thread if they are have too high a plush. Contrast the weight of the thread with the plushness of the fabric to ensure that this is avoided before commencing a project. This will help you to avoid having to unpick hours of work.
Use richer fabrics such as velvet for heavier threads. Such fabric is ideal for ribbon work.

, While this is a personal choice dependent on your own embroidery style, many stitchers prefer natural fabrics because they tend to be easier to work with. For example, cottons, linens, wools and muslins feel good to the touch and have good give when pushing the needle through them. Synthetics can be harder to work with, harder to push the needle through and less enjoyable to touch as you work on them. Synthetics can also be abrasive on fine threads. That said, it is down to what you need for the project and how comfortable you are using different fabric types; it's best to experiment and find your preferred mediums.

, Consider whether you will be making simple stitches or elaborate ones that build up in weight and size? The type of stitch has a definite impact on the type of fabric needed. The more elaborate stitching, such as ribbon flowers, the more the need for a heavier fabric backing to support the weight of the finished stitch. Consider the following:


If using ribbon, many strands of thread at once, wool, etc., then you are using heavy thread or stitching mediums and the fabric will need to be stronger to accommodate the stitching. If using Aida cloth, the count must be coarser (in the lower count levels around 7 to 12).
If using single strands of cotton or embroidery thread, the fabric can be lightweight and even delicate. If using Aida cloth, the count can be much finer, even up to 28 if the thread is very delicate.
Are you hand stitching or machine stitching? If using delicate fabric for embroidery, you are usually better off with hand stitching, while using a heavier weight fabric for machine stitching embroidery projects.

, How do you want the project to present when completed? The finish will be an important part of fabric choice because the fabric background will impact the overall feel of the project. Take a good look at the fabric choices you have to get a feel for what matches your project design. Touch the fabric too––how does it feel under your hands? This matters since you'll be handling the fabric a lot. Combine your ""feel"" with the above considerations and then choose what fits your project needs the best. Things to consider include:



Matt fabric: This will produce a non-reflective surface. This is great for a busy embroidery piece, for rustic embroidery and for projects where the embroidery threads are shiny and bold. Most embroidery projects will be based on matt fabric, such as muslin, bark cloth, Osnaburg, unpolished cottons, Aida, calico, burlap, etc.

Shiny fabric: This will produce a more polished appearance for the finish. Such a fabric creates a greater contrast between your project and the background. Shiny fabrics such as satin or synthetics may prove to be harder to work with; this will depend on the fabric type. Silk is shiny and many embroiderers enjoy working with it.

Color: Many an embroidered project sticks with white, cream or beige. Sometimes black is an ideal background color to set off the thread colors. But it doesn't have to be stuck in this color range––you can expand your horizons and use any colored background that you consider suitable for the end result. If varying the choices, be sure to complement the background fabric color with the majority thread colors.

Patterned fabric: If the fabric has a pattern, be very careful that the pattern fits in with the design you're creating and doesn't ""steal the show"". If the pattern clashes, is too bold or is just too dominant, then you may find it is not suitable for the embroidery project as it overwhelms the entire design. Patterns that can work include small gingham checks without too much color variation or a single large fabric pattern design that forms the actual basis of what you are embroidering (such as stitching around an animal or plant design). Many stitchers find plain, natural colored fabrics are easier to work with, especially as a beginner but don't let this stop you from being more creative.

, This is a fairly important consideration because you want the embroidery to be able to withstand its intended use. There is a world of difference between fabric that can handle a tea party as a tablecloth and fabric that only ever gets hung on the wall as a decoration piece. If using the embroidery for tablecloths, napkins, hand towels and similar frequent use items that will suffer wear and tear, the fabric needs to be strong and easily washable. On the other hand, if the item is going to be decorative and displayed, more delicate fabrics that don't need washing that often can be used.

, Cut off a small piece (square) of fabric that you'd like to use and do a small design using the exact stitching threads (and other embellishments) that you intend using. See how the fabric piece stands up and decide whether or not it's the right piece for your project.

, This helps to ensure that the fabric is clean but also that it won't pucker when you begin stitching. Washing can pre-shrink any fabric prone to this, which will make an important difference in a project where shrinkage will spoil the design, such as quilting.


How the fabric is washed depends on what type of fabric you're using. If you're not sure, ask the retailer or manufacturer for their advice, or do an online search for that type of fabric and the washing suggestions. You can always wash a test piece if needed, to see how it reacts to the washing process.

, If you begin a project with wrinkly fabric, you'll end the project with wrinkly fabric too! After washing the fabric, be sure to press it as well. Of course, how you press it depends on the type of fabric; some fabrics may need a hot iron, some a cold iron, etc. You need to determine that before ironing, based on the fabric you have. If the fabric is wrinkle-free, then skip this step.

, In some cases, you may need to prepare the fabric before adding the embroidery elements, in order to strengthen it. You can add iron-on or tacked-on interfacing to the back of fabric to strengthen it for heavier stitching. This may be especially important for more delicate fabric where you intend to use heavy yarn or beading.

Check the design for recommendations.,
Identify the colors you will need.,
Note any special texture needs.,
Consider the brand.,
Avoid using sewing thread, bargain thread, or old thread.",How to Choose Embroidery Floss1," If you are working from a design, then make sure that you check the design for embroidery floss recommendations.This can take the guesswork out of choosing and embroidery floss brand, color, and type.


Bring the design guide along with you to the craft store as a reference or make a list of the items you will need before you go.;
, Your project may only require one color or you may need several colors. Embroidery floss comes in a wide range of colors, so you will have many options to choose from.To make it easier to choose when you arrive at the craft store, make a list of the colors you will need before you go.

, Adding texture to your projects is optional, but it can be a nice touch. Think about your embroidery project to decide if using a special thread might help to give your project the desired texture.For example, if you will be hand embroidering a landscape, then using wool thread for the grass could provide texture.

, Using a well-known brand name will help to ensure that you are getting a quality thread, and it will also help to reduce the chance that you are buying old thread that has been on the rack for a long time. Some brand name threads to look for include:Coats & Clark
Madeira
DMC
Anchor
Cosmo
Presencia
Janome

, It may be tempting to pick up thread sold in bins at dollar stores or on clearance racks, but you should avoid buying these types of thread. If the thread is cheap or old, then it will be more likely to shred or break while you are using it.Purchase thread that looks like it is in good condition and avoid any old looking thread.

Start out with stranded cotton.,
Use perle cotton.,
Try cotton floss or coton a broder.,
Opt for silk if you want a high sheen.,
Use wool thread for a hairy or fuzzy effect.",How to Choose Embroidery Floss2," Stranded cotton is the standard type of thread for hand embroidery. It consists of multiple strands, which you can break apart and use between one and six of the strands at once. Using one strand will create a delicate effect while using more strands will result in a thicker, textured look.If you are new to embroidery, then you may want to start out with this type of floss.

, Perle cotton consists of two strands that are twisted together and cannot be separated. This floss creates a more textured look than stranded cotton. It comes in several different sizes depending on how thick you want it to be.This thread may also appear a bit shiner than stranded cotton, so it is a good option if you want to add a bit of shine.

, These types of cotton thread are straighter and smoother looking than stranded or perle cotton thread. Both are great choices for fine detail work.Cotton floche is made up of four strands that you cannot pull apart. It is great for adding fine details to your project.Coton a broder (French for “embroidery cotton) is a lot like cotton floche, but instead of four strands, coton a broder has five strands. It is great for creating tiny designs and fine details., Silk is the natural choice if you want your hand embroidery to be shiny and luxurious looking. Silk floss comes in many different colors, which may even appear more vibrant than cotton floss in the same colors.You can get silk floss in multiple sizes as well to suit the needs of your project.

, Wool thread is also a great option for hand embroidery. You cannot sue wool thread with a machine because it is too rough, but it works well for hand embroidery and you can use it to make plants, animals, and other things in your design look hairy or fuzzy.For example, if you were creating a rabbit, then using a light brown or white wool floss could make the rabbit appear furry.

Opt for rayon thread for high performance.,
Choose polyester if you plan to wash the embroidered garment often.,
Go with cotton thread if you want a softer sheen.,
Use silk thread if you want a shiny, luxurious look.,
Try metallic and mylar threads for a reflective look.,
Check out special effects threads.",How to Choose Embroidery Floss3," Rayon thread is an all-around great choice for machine embroidery because it is strong, has a nice sheen, and you can use it with high speed stitching.You may want to use this thread if you are new to machine embroidery and/or want a high performance thread for your project.

, Polyester is a lot like rayon thread in the way it looks and performs. However, polyester thread holds up best against frequent washing and even when using bleach.Polyester is also less likely to break while sewing with it than rayon thread., Cotton is also an option for machine embroidery. It is not as shiny as rayon or polyester, but it performs well and it has a light shine to it. Cotton thread is also available in an ultra-fine 100 weight. However, such a fine strand will be prone to breaking, so it is best to choose 30 or 40 weight thread., You can also get silk thread for machine embroidery, which will give your project a high sheen and it will also feel nice and smooth. Silk thread also performs well for machine embroidery. Go for a 30 to 50 weight thread for best results., If you want your project to have the appearance of silver, gold, or bronze, then choosing a metallic or mylar thread may be the best choice. For example, you could embroider a gold star on a garment as an accent, or use metallic thread to embroider someone’s name or initials.


However, keep in mind that metallic and mylar threads can be difficult to work with. You will need to adjust your machine’s tension and go at a slower speed while working with these threads., There are also special effect threads to choose from. Embroidery floss comes in neon colors, glow-in-the-dark, and even color changing threads that change in the sunlight.If you want to add an interesting touch to your project, consider using one of these threads.


For example, you could embroider the moon in your project using glow-in-the-dark thread, or use color changing thread to embroider initials on a shirt.

Stone Preparation - To begin making a piece of tufa cast jewelry you start by cutting a piece of tufa stone to the desired size that works best for your design.,
Create of a Design.,
Carve the Tufa Stone.,
Carbonize the Tufa Stone and Melt the Silver.,
Sand and Clean the Cast Silver.,
Polish.,
Complete the Work.",How to Tufa Cast," After the stone has been cut to size you must rub two sides of the stone together to create two sides that are perfectly flat and fit flush together.;
, After the stone is ready for use, a design is sketched directly onto it.

, The design is carved into the stone with hand chisel tools, wood files, sewing needles, paperclips and other tools. A dremel can be used for removing larger amounts of material. The carving must be done with perfection. Once a part of the stone is removed, it cannot be added back. The areas of negative space become the positive space where the silver fills in and forms the piece. Any mistake can render the stone as useless. You must add a sprue hole at the top of the rocks to allow the silver to be poured into the mold. It is also important that you carve air vents that go from the design all the way off the edge of the tufa stone. This will allow for air to escape as the silver is poured in.

, It is essential to have the tufa stone carbonized before pouring the silver. This can be done with using just the gas of a torch without the oxygen. With the two parts of the stone covered in soot and bound with a piece of rubber or clamps add the correct amount of silver into a crucible and melt it with a torch to a molten state. Pouring only takes a moment, and if done correctly should fill the entire mold.

, The silver piece is removed from the mold and the extra silver in the sprue hole, not a part of the design, is cut from the piece. Sanding cleans and smooths the design, but the texture that is distinctive to tufa cast work is left where desired. This is the beauty of this form of casting. There may be smoothed sections that are created to provide contrast with the texture left by the tufa stone. Links that have been soldered together should also be individually sanded to make for a seamless link of silver. The piece can also be cleaned in a citric acid pickling solution to remove any fire scale caused when casting or soldering.

, Polishing can be done with water and a rubber wheel or it can be done using polishing compounds. There is pre polishing compounds. Cut and finish compounds and final stage compounds. They can range from abrasive to non abrasive.

, The final stages of creating a one of a kind piece may include various methods in order to set stones, create unique forms through the melding of multiple tufa cast silver pieces, adding links to connect pieces, or implementing whatever other inspiration comes to mind. Sanding and polishing a piece can be very time consuming. Depending on the piece of jewelry it can be up to forty or fifty percent of the work.

Gather your materials.,
Thread the needle.,
Make a basic straight stitch.,
Push the needle through one stitch ahead.,
Go back and in to complete the stitch.,
Imagine the curve you want to create.,
Stitch as close to the curve as possible.,
Wrap the stitches.",How to Backstitch Curves in Cross Stitch," You will need some special materials to backstitch a curve. Before you get started, you will need to get:


Cross stitch fabric
Hoop to hold fabric in place
Needle
Thread
Scissors
Paper and pins or chalk for creating a guide curve (optional);
, Thread the needle with your chosen thread. Make sure to anchor the thread using a knot at the end or by holding it until you have a few stitches in place that will keep the thread from sliding out. You can trim off the knot after you have a few stitches to anchor the knot.Make sure that you choose a needle that is appropriate for your thread. For example, if it is a thicker thread, then you may need to use a large eye needle.
Ensure that you have enough thread on the needle to complete your stitches for the project.

, To start your back stitching, begin by making a basic backstitch that is about ¼” (0.6cm) long. To do this insert the needle through your fabric from the back side and going out the front, then come back through the fabric by going into the front side and out the back.This straight stitch will help to anchor your thread and it is essential for starting your backstitching.

, To create your first back stitch, push the needle through the back side of the fabric and out the front. The needle should come out the front one stitch space ahead of the end of your first straight stitch.Keep the stitches to about ¼” (0.6cm) like you did with the straight stitch.

, To complete your first straight stitch, you will need to insert the needle in through the space next to the end of the straight stitch. Bring the thread back to this point and then insert the needle into the same space as the straight stitch thread is going through.Repeat the process by bringing the thread back out one stitch space ahead of the backstitch you just created.

, Backstitching in a curve requires you to use a more freeform approach. Start by imagining the curve you want to create running along your stitching surface.You can also use a paper cutout pinned to your stitching surface to help guide you, or even draw a chalk line on the stitching surface. However, this is optional.

, Create your backstitches as close to the curve as you can. They may not form a perfect curve, but it will be close. Keep backstitching until you reach the end of the curve you want to create.Keep in mind that smaller backstitches will create a less jagged appearance. If you notice after a few stitches that the line looks extra choppy, then reduce the size of the stitches.

, Wrapping your stitches will help to give the curve a softer finish and reduce the look of any jagged edges. To wrap your stitches, leave the thread connected after you finish your last stitch. Then, slide the needle under the last stitch you did. Do not go through the fabric. Slide the needle under the stitch and out the other side. Then, return the needle to the starting position and wrap the next stitch.Continue wrapping the stitches to the end of the backstitches. Then, you can anchor the thread by doing a couple of straight stitches. Cut the excess to complete your curve.

Select a heat source.,
Purchase sterling silver clay.,
Form the clay into the design of your choice.,
Dry and sand the clay.,
Fire the clay with a torch.,
Fire the clay with a gas stove.,
Fire the clay in a kiln.,
Quench the silver (optional).,
Polish the surface (optional).",How to Make Sterling Silver Jewelry1," After sculpting the clay, you'll need to fire it at high heat in order to burn away the the binding material and leave only the silver behind. Some brands of metal clay can be fired over a gas stove, while others require a gas torch or even a kiln. Check what temperatures you can achieve with your tools before you select a clay.


You'll need a stainless steel mesh if using a stove.
Find a heat brick if using a gas torch.
A kiln is recommended for large or thick items.
To estimate the temperature you can achieve on your gas stove, heat a small, thin aluminum pan on high and point an infrared thermometer at the surface once it is fully heated.;
, You may need to order this online, as not many art stores have it in stock. Pure silver clay is significantly more common, but the resulting jewelry will be less sturdy.


You can purchase this in lump form for sculpting, as a softer paste extruded from a syringe for finer detail work, or even in ""paper"" form for origami designs., You can sculpt this clay with hands or ordinary sculpting tools, add detail with a knife or wire, or cut it into shapes with stencils.The silver clay will shrink during firing, so make the jewelry slightly on the large side. Check the label for details, as shrinking can vary from 8% to 30% between products.You can push a metal stamp or any metal object into the clay to form a surface design., Allow the silver clay to air dry overnight, or dry it thoroughly using a hairdryer. Smooth the surface with fine sandpaper.

, If using a torch, place the clay on a heat brick, and the brick on a heat-safe surface. Hold the torch flame ¾ inch (2 cm) from the clay and heat until it catches fire, burns out, glows red, then reaches an even glow. Continue to heat for at least five minutes, or however long your clay instructions recommend.Look away periodically to relieve your eyes.

, If you are using a gas stove, follow these instructions instead:


Place a piece of stainless steel mesh on a stove top burner. Turn the burner on to its highest setting.
Observe the mesh to locate the hottest area on it. This area will glow. Turn the burner off and allow the mesh to return to it's normal color.
Place the silver onto the hottest area of the mesh and turn the burner back on, this time to a low flame. Use tweezers or flat, non-serrated pliers to handle the silver.
After the clay has burned off completely, turn up the burner and heat until the silver glows red. Turn it down again if it glows orange.Continue heating for ten minutes, then turn off the heat.

, If you have a kiln, you'll be able to follow the precise recommendations on your silver clay. Maximum strength may be achieved with a long firing at relatively high temperatures, but there may be a faster firing option outlined on the instructions as well. A specialized jeweler's kiln will fire faster, but a ceramics kiln will work as well.


The optimal firing temperature for most silver clay is 1650ºF (900ºC), held for 2 hours, but the jewelry might come out strong enough even at temperatures as low as 1200ºF (650ºC)., Letting the silver cool on its own is recommended. If you are in a rush, you can quench the hot silver in cool water to bring it down in temperature, although it may still not be safe to touch for a few minutes. This can cause structural issues if reheated for adjustment later, but thorough drying can prevent this.Never quench jewelry with embedded glass, precious stones, or other additions., The silver will look white and a little dull after firing. If you want the shiny silver appearance you may be used to, brush the surface with a brass or steel wire brush, or polish with a buffing machine and jeweler's rouge.

"

Pick the silver.,
Gather supplies.,
Assemble the jeweler's saw and buffing machine.,
Choose a design that you would like to use.,
Cut the silver in the chosen shape.,
Stamp the clay (optional).,
Polish the jewelry on the buffing machine.,
Wash in warm soapy water.,
Attach an ear hook to each earring.",How to Make Sterling Silver Jewelry2," For typical small jewelry such as an earring, you'll want a strip of sterling silver at least 2.5 inches wide and no more than 3.5 inches long. You can adjust these dimensions if you have a specific design in mind, but it may become a little harder to work with. 22 gauge and 24 gauge sheeting are commonly used.


Sterling silver may be labeled ""ster"" or "".925."", Silver is soft enough to be cut by a jeweler's saw, but will need buffing afterward to smooth out the sharp edges. These specialized tools can be found at craft stores, hardware stores, or online.


A jeweler's saw with a saw blade numbered 2/0
A small buffing machine with canton flannel wheels (or a bench grinder with the grinding wheel replaced)Jeweler's rouge or blue polishing compound. (Scratched silver may require white rouge or brown Tripoli polishing compound instead.)
For earrings: sterling silver ear hooks, a drill, and a number 64 drill bit
For surface designs: a metal stamp and hammer.

, Insert the saw blade into the upper end of the jeweler's saw and fasten the wing nut. Insert the lower end and tighten the wing nut while pulling on the frame to add tension. The buffing machine may already come pre-assembled, or you may need to consult to add the buffing wheels according to your model's instructions. Mount the buffing machine on your workbench.


To test the saw, stroke the blade with a fingernail and listen for a ""Ping"" sound. If it does not make this sound, tighten the saw until it does when stroked.

, You can sketch out the shape yourself, or find a design online or in magazines. For a pair of matching earrings, make two identical copies.

, Tape the design over the silver sheeting and use the saw to cut through the outline.


Use a slightly forward tilt to the saw as you cut.
Move the saw up and down as you cut.

, The easiest way to add detail to the surface is to purchase a stamp designed to imprint silver. To stamp a thin sheet of silver, lay the stamp over the metal and hammer it in firmly. Make sure the stamp stays flat and in position while you hammer it several times.

, Following your model's instructions is recommended. Generally speaking, the jeweler turns on the machine and applies polish (jeweler's rouge) sparingly to the wheel. Gently touch the jewelry to the surface of the wheel to smooth out rough edges and polish the surface., This will remove polish residue. Dry with a soft, clean cloth, preferably wool or chamois., Drill a small hole near the top of each earring, insert one end of the hook, and twist the hook around itself or tuck it over the earring edge to attach it firmly. Obviously, you can skip this step if making jewelry that does not require a hook attachment

Gather materials.,
Set up a safe work area.,
Clean and apply flux.,
Solder the silver.,
Rinse, pickle, and rinse again.,
Add gemstone or glass (optional).",How to Make Sterling Silver Jewelry3," If you want to join multiple pieces of silver together, soldering is typically the easiest home method. It still requires quite a bit of preparation, and the following materials:


Use a ""medium"" or ""hard"" silver solder made from silver alloy, not standard solder. Avoid solder containing cadmium unless you have a respirator.
A small oxy-acetylene or butane torch, preferably with a flat ""chisel tip.""
Any brazing or soldering flux labeled as suitable for silver.
Copper tongs and tweezers (of any metal) for handling the silver.
A ""pickle"" solution for soldering, heated according to label instructions before you begin.

, You'll need a well-ventilated room and a heat-resistant work table, plus a heat brick to work on. Goggles are essential for detail work, to protect yourself from spatter during close inspection. Gloves, a denim or leather apron and tight-fitting, non-synthetic clothing are good additional precautions.


You'll need a container of water anyway to rinse the jewelry, but a fire extinguisher doesn't hurt if you are working in a room with flammable materials.

, If the silver is greasy or has been heavily handled, rub on a degreasing solution. Dip in the pickle solution if the silver is black from oxidization. Once clean, brush the flux onto the silver, over the areas to be joined.


Powdered flux must be mixed into a paste or liquid form first. Check the instructions for details.

, If you have never soldered anything before, this in-depth guide may help. Alternatively, you can follow these quick steps:


Position the objects carefully on the heat brick, then apply a chip of solder (or a dab of solder paste) with tweezers.
Heat from about 4 inches (10 cm) away, focusing on the thicker piece of silver. Do not heat solder directly. Hold thin pieces of silver with tweezers to prevent melting.

, Once the solder has melted along the gap between the pieces, turn off the heat and wait a minute or two for the solder to solidify. Use your copper tongs to dip the silver first into the water bath, then into the pickle solution to remove oxidization created during soldering. Rinse a final time in water, then pat dry.


Avoid putting the pickle in contact with skin and clothes, as it can be corrosive.
Non-copper tongs may react with the pickle, corroding the metal.
If you prefer the look of ""aged"" silver, you can skip the pickle.

, These are best added to jewelry with a two-part epoxy glue. Solder a silver ""bezel cup"" to the jewelry, sand the walls down if necessary with coarse sandpaper, then glue in the stone and let dry as instructed by the epoxy label."
"
Twist with flat pliers.,
Hammer silver wire into jewelry.,
Use different hammers for different effects.,
Try hot forging.",How to Make Sterling Silver Jewelry4," Serrated tongs will mark the silver, so precious metal jewelers use flat pliers only. You may find several sizes and shapes handy if you're making a lot of jewelry, including round nose pliers and wire cutting pliers.

, Silver is quite malleable, and thick silver wire is often shaped into necklaces or arm bands. Simple lay the wire on a small anvil or other flat, hard metal surface and tap repeatedly and gently with a mallet or hammer into the desired shape.To attach a pendant, wrap the wire around an object, or solder it to a pendant with a sterling silver attachment point.

, For precise control, you can use several hammers, most commonly a flat mallet and a round ball peen hammer, or a couple examples of each in different sizes.Once the shape is complete, you can use a texturing hammer to alter the surface feel, or a planishing hammer to smooth out the dents on a bent or curved surface.For the most predictable and controlled effect, let the hammer fall from directly above the silver, striking the surface at a 90º angle.

, This is not a common approach for silver, since it can be manipulated while cold. However, if you have some experience under your belt and want to experiment with tight, intricate curves, hot forging could be the next step. You'll need a small gas forge — or possibly an electric oven with excellent temperature control — able to heat the silver to a cherry-red glow and keep it stable at that temperature while you manipulate it with pliers and hammering.The correct temperature is typically around 1100ºF (600ºC), but this varies depending on the exact alloy of your sterling silver.

The proper way to open a jump ring is to twist the wire until the required opening is achieved.,
Do not pull it open.,
Use two pairs of flat nose pliers.,
Grasp the jump ring on opposite sides using the flat nose pliers.,
Use a ""twisting"" motion only to open the jump ring.,
You should now have the jump ring open.",How to Open a Jump Ring,";
, this does several very bad things: weakens and distorts the metal, creates an unappealing rump ring shape and makes it impossible to close the jump ring correctly.

, These will allow for a firm grasp of the wire and also prevents slipping and marring (distortion or marking).

, First, try holding onto the jump ring with one pair of pliers. While continuing to grasp the jump ring firmly in one hand, pick up your second pair of pliers with the other hand and grasp the other side of the jump ring.

, Basically, one hand should rotate towards you and the other will rotate away from you. It may take a little practice to get used to holding onto both pair of pliers, but it's worth the effort, and requires much less work in the future.

, To close it, use the same steps as above. You may have to work around any item you have now added to the jump ring but the same technique applies.

Use seed beads and bugle beads for dangly earrings.,
Make a foundation row with bugle beads.,
Make a tapered tip above the foundation row.,
Create a pattern with dangling bead strands.",How to Make Native American Jewelry1," Create earrings with small beads in a style often associated with Native American art. Play around with your own patterns using different colors of seed beads and bugle beads strung together with beading thread.


Look for seed beads in the common 11/0 size and a long size of bugle bead, which can both be found in the beading section of any craft store. You can use other shapes and sizes of beads, but these are most common for this style.
Use a beading needle and nylon beading thread for the easiest construction of dangling beaded earrings. You will also need a 4mm jump ring and an earring hook to complete each earring. These are also found in most craft stores.;
, String together a row of bugle beads to make the top foundation of your earring where other strands will dangle from. Use a ladder stitch to make the bugle beads sit side-to-side rather than end-to-end.


To do a ladder stitch with the bugle beads, first pick up two beads with your needle and pull them down almost to the end of your thread, leaving about a 6 inch tail. Then thread your needle through just the first bead, in the same direction you did to begin, and pull the thread tight until the two beads naturally sit parallel to one another.
Continue the ladder stitch for as many beads as you want your foundation row to have. After the stitch with the first two beads, pick up a new bugle bead on your thread and put your needle through the last bead in the same direction that you used to thread it on, and pull it tight. Continue this stitch for each bead in the row.
The number of bugle beads you use in your foundation row will determine how wide your earring is and how many dangling strands you will have. If you plan on a symmetrical pattern of chevrons, diamonds, etc., note that you will need to use an odd number of beads in your row., Add seed beads above your foundation row in a triangular shape that with taper up to your earring hook. Use a brick stitch to naturally decrease each beaded row by one until you reach the top.


To do a brick stitch, pick up two seed beads on your thread. Note where you can see the thread go in and out of each bugle bead in your foundation rows—each of these spots is called a thread bridge. Skip the first thread bridge and thread your needle with the two seed beads through the second thread bridge and pull tight.
Then bring your needle back up through the last seed bead. To even out the first two beads, go back down through the first bead and back up through the second bead. Then continue the rest of the row by picking up one seed bead, threading your needle through the next thread bridge in the row, and bringing the needle back up through the bead.
Continue till the end of the row, then start a new one using the thread bridges on the row you just created. Keep creating rows until you’ve completed the last one with just one bead., Bring your needle and thread down through all the seed beads on one side of your tapered top section and through the end bugle bead in your foundation row. Use the rest of your thread to create single dangling strands of beads in whatever pattern you like.


To create the first strand, string all of the seed beads you want in that strand, in order from top to bottom, onto your thread. Then, skipping the last bead you put on, bring your needle all the way back through each bead till you’re back up at the top.
Then thread your needle back through the bugle bead above that strand and back down through the next bugle bead so you can create your second strand. Continue in this way for all of your strands.
Make sure that when you pull your thread back up through each strand that you don’t pull too tightly. You want the beads on these strands to be loose enough that they will dangle nicely, but without showing any thread in between."

Create a beaded medallion.,
Make a simple stone pendant.,
Utilize feathers in a necklace.",How to Make Native American Jewelry2," Make a medallion necklace similar to what might be worn at a Native American powwow by using seed beads and felt. Bead designs into a circular piece of felt, and attach that to a leather or faux leather cord.


You can create any design you want on the medallion with different colored seed beads. To sew on beads securely, use nylon beading thread to pick up four beads, stitch through your foundation material, then loop back through the last two beads before picking up four new ones.Use a sharp needle that can go through the felt for your medallion but still thin enough to fit through your beads. You can use larger beads, or a thinner foundation material and attach it to felt later, if you’re having trouble with this.

, Put a stone on display by stringing it on a cord to wear as a necklace. Use turquoise, coral, or other precious or semiprecious stones commonly found in Native American jewelry.


Try using a natural material for the cord such as leather or suede, or an imitation version of these.
Look for a stone in a jewelry store that has a pre-drilled hole or a jump ring to run a cord through. If you can’t find this, you can try wrapping a stone in thin, flexible wire in order to attach it to a cord for your necklace., Attach one or more feathers to the bottom of any pendant or medallion for a natural touch. You can also feature feathers exclusively in your necklace by wrapping the feather quills with cord.


Use natural feathers rather than ones that have been artificially dyed.
You can also thread beads onto the quill of a feather for decoration and to help attach it to the cord or chain of a necklace. Push a bead onto the quill, then thread a headpin (flexible pin with a flat end) through the bead in the opposite direction. Then bend the headpin around a jump ring or your cord to attach it."
"
Make a natural leaf or grass bracelet.,
Create a simple silver medallion bracelet with buttons.,
Make a beaded bracelet.",How to Make Native American Jewelry3," Create truly natural and native jewelry by using grass or leaves, like the traditional rattlesnake master leaf, to make a bracelet. Twist sturdy material so that it becomes cord-like and can be wrapped or braided into a bracelet.


You can find rattlesnake master growing in prairie areas of the Midwestern United States. You can also experiment with other thin leaves or grasses that will hold up when twisted and folded.
To use a long grass or leaf like rattlesnake master, fold it in the middle and hold onto the fold with one hand. With your other hand, twist one half of the material clockwise so that it rolls into a cord-like shape, then wrap it counterclockwise around the other half of the material.
Do the same with the opposite side, and continue twisting and wrapping with alternating sides until you have a twisted length of bracelet that you can tie off. Push the tied end through the loop you created in the beginning so the bracelet holds together around your wrist., Use silver buttons to recreate a carved silver cuff or bracelet that you might see in Native American-inspired jewelry. Attach buttons to a cord to wrap around your wrist.


Wrap a length of cord around your wrist and add about 6 inches (15 cm) to that length to make sure you have room to tie off and secure your bracelet.
Look for silver buttons with patterns of animals, nature, or other Native American patterns and designs.
You can also alternate silver buttons with semiprecious stones or other beads to add color and interest.

, Use seed beads and beading thread to create a patterned bracelet with different colors. Try incorporating a leather cord on either side of your beading for a natural touch. If you do use cord, make sure it is the double the circumference of your wrist, plus 12 extra inches.


Fold over and tie a knot in a leather or other cord so it makes a loop. Tie a piece of beading thread right under the knot to begin adding seed beads. Use just one bead in the first row, two in the second, and so on until you reach the width you’d like for the length of your bracelet.
To secure the rows of beads between the leather cord, wrap your beading thread under one side of the cord, then string on the beads for your row. Wrap the thread over and around the other side of the cord, then thread back through the beads in your row.
Finish the bracelet by tapering off the number of beads in each row back to just one bead like you began with. Then tie off the beading thread and the cord with a button that you can push through your loop at the other end to act as a clasp."

Let dry.",How to Make Resin Jewelry," Cover the entire work area with wax paper.

Resin drips and splashes will be very difficult to remove, so it's best to avoid the problem completely.
You should also protect yourself by wearing rubber or plastic gloves and safety goggles.
Always work in a well-ventilated area. Open windows and run fans to prevent the fumes from building up. If you have breathing difficulties, you may even want to wear a respirator designed to block or filter strong fumes.;
, Get creative. You can use flat two-dimensional objects and more elaborate three-dimensional objects. Just make sure that your intended arrangement will fit inside the resin mold or bezel.

Popular ideas include broken or re-purposed jewelry, flowers, glitter, sprinkles, transparencies with words printed on them, scraps of fabric, scraps of ribbon, and decorative scrapbook paper.
Some objects may not work as well as others, though. For instance, cured resin obscures the facets of loose crystal gems, causing them to disappear inside the piece., Coat the top, bottom, and sides of all porous embellishments with Mod Podge or a similar clear sealant. Let the sealant dry before using the embellishments.Porous embellishments include all papers and fabrics.
If you skip this step, these embellishments may discolor. They can also cause more air bubbles to appear in the resin.

, When using transparencies and papers, make sure that the size of the piece precisely matches the dimensions of your mold or bezel., Bezels are easiest to work with since you don't need to remove the resin after it cures, but molds give you greater flexibility in design.

Bezels are empty, open-ended charm settings. Once you pour the resin in and let it cure, the piece is finished and ready to attach to a chain.
Molds will only allow you to shape the resin. You will need to take additional steps to turn the resin into a pendant or charm before using it as such.
Make sure that any molds you use are labeled specifically for use with resin.

, If you decide to use a mold, you need to spray the mold with mold release product. Let the mold release dry before continuing.

Do not spray bezels with mold release. Mold release makes it easier for you to remove the finished resin pieces. Since the resin is supposed to stay inside the bezel, you'll want it to remain stuck in place as firmly as possible.

, If you decide to use a bezel, cut a piece of thick, sturdy packing tape and carefully stick it onto one side of the bezel.

Make sure that the tape is secure and that there are no gaps between it and that side of the bezel.
This is not necessary if you are using a mold or if the bezel is already closed on one side. Only follow this step if you are using a bezel with two open sides.

, For best results, choose polyurethane casting resin, not polyester casting resin.Polyester resin is more toxic and tends to retain an odor even after the pieces harden.
To make the process easier, you should also make sure that the resin you buy is mixed in a one-to-one ratio with its catalyst.

, Fill a small bowl with hot tap water and rest the two bottles inside, keeping the contents of the bottles submerged beneath the level of the water.

Do not use boiling water.
Warming the resin and catalyst in this manner makes it easier to mix the two components smoothly. It also reduces the likelihood of dealing with air bubbles.

, Combine the resin and catalyst in a small plastic measuring cup, adding equal parts of each. Stir continuously for two minutes using a wooden stick.

Follow the instructions that come with your resin for this step. Some resins may require more or less stirring time.
Only mix as much resin as you expect to use. It will not stay in its liquid form for long, so if you make too much, it'll go to waste.
Pour the resin in first, then follow it with an equal amount of the catalyst.
Use a graduated measuring cup and measure out both components directly inside the cup.
Old, clean cough syrup measuring cups work very well for this, but any graduated measuring cup should suffice. Make sure that you use a cup you don't mind sacrificing, though. It can be reused for other resin projects, but you should not reuse this measuring cup for food, drink, or medicine purposes.
Stir slowly to prevent air bubbles from building up.
Scrape the stick along the edges and bottom of the cup as you stir to ensure thorough, even mixing.

, If you want to create clear resin jewelry, no color pigment is needed. If you want to give each piece a tint of color, however, now is the time to add the pigment.Add liquid colors one drop at a time, stirring after each addition.
Combine dry pigments with a little resin in a separate cup first, then combine the colored solution with the rest of the clear resin.

, Pour enough of the liquid resin mix into the mold or bezel to completely cover the bottom.Work slowly to reduce the number of air bubbles.

, Hold a hair dryer or heat gun roughly 4 inches (10 cm) above the resin for a minute or so. Any air bubbles trapped inside should rise to the surface and pop.

Even though you'll be adding another layer of resin later, it's best to remove the air bubbles in this layer now instead of waiting until the end.

, Wait 15 minutes or so, allowing the resin in your mold to harden slightly. Carefully place heavy three-dimensional objects on top of the bottom layer using tweezers.

The bottom of the mold or bezel will be the front of your piece, so place the items in upside-down.
By placing the heavy embellishments in between layers of resin, you help hold them in place. If you added them without using layers, the pieces would likely move around before the resin sets.

, Pour additional resin over the heavy embellishments, covering them completely.

This layer of resin should reach the top of the bezel or mold.
You may need to adjust the position of your embellishments with a toothpick if they shift during this time.

, If you want a glittery background, sprinkle the glitter over the top of the mold or bezel after filling it with your final layer of resin.

Glitter is small and light, so it should float on the surface of the resin as it dries. Since the top will later become the back of the piece, the glitter will create a background.

, If you plan to add any transparencies, dip them in a little leftover resin before placing them in the mold.

Use tweezers to dunk the transparency into the leftover resin in your measuring cup. Quickly dry the resin with your heat gun or hair dryer.
Coating the transparencies will help reduce the risk of air bubbles forming between them and the resin in your mold.
The bottom of your mold or bezel will end up being the front of your piece, so place the transparency in upside-down.

, As before, use your hair dryer or heat gun to gently bring any air bubbles to the surface, where they can pop., If you plan to use a paper background, use tweezers to carefully place the paper over the top of the resin, aligning it as evenly as possible with the opening of the mold or bezel.

Make sure that the paper is upside-down when you place it in so that the decorative side shows from the front of the piece.

, Set the filled mold or bezel aside and cover it with a clean box. Allow the resin to cure overnight.

It is important to cover the resin as it cures to protect it from dust or other debris.
Curing times can vary, so you'll need to follow the manufacturer's instructions. Only cure it long enough for the resin to be touchable. Do not wait until the resin is fully cured.

, Once cured, you should be able to pop the resin pieces out of their molds using your fingers.

If the pieces are still too soft to remove, try placing the mold in your freezer for 10 minutes. That should make it easier to pop the finished pieces out.
At this point, the resin piece is ready to work with, but you'll need to take additional steps before you can wear it as jewelry.

, If you used a bezel instead of a mold, you will need to peel off the tape from the back of the bezel once the resin cures.

Do not remove the resin from the bezel.
At this point, the resin charm is complete and ready to use as wearable jewelry.

, Grab the eye of an eye pin with pliers and carefully heat the metal over the flame of a candle or gas stove. Only heat the metal for about 5 seconds.

Work carefully to prevent accidental burns.
Use an eye pin that is just a little shorter than the width of the resin piece.

, Grab the resin piece with one hand and carefully poke the straight side of the heated eye pin inside.

Press the pin in until it extends roughly halfway through the resin piece.
This will only work if the resin is only partially cured. If you allowed it to cure completely, it will be too hard and unyielding.

, Once the metal eye pin is cool enough to touch with your bare fingers, slide a small jump ring into the eye.

This completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable pendant or charm.

, Apply quick hold contact adhesive to the top of the ring mount or pin backing. Press the mount or backing over the center back of your resin piece.

Work quickly to prevent the adhesive from setting before it's attached to the resin.
Keep the mount or backing as centered as possible.

, Follow the adhesive manufacturer's instructions and let the adhesive set completely.

This step completes the project and turns your resin piece into a wearable ring or brooch.

Lay the piece of Jewelry on a covered, flat work surface.,
Choose the nail polish colors you'd like to use.,
Paint the gems that you've chosen to paint.,
Add another coat or two if needed.,
Seal the nail polish if wished.,
Ensure that the jewelry is completely dry before wearing it.

",How to Make Nail Polish Jewelery1," Decide how you would like to change the piece––choose the parts of it that you'll change the color of, along with which colors you'll use. Usually you'll be focusing on whatever counts as ""gems"" in the Jewelry, to give them a new, colorful appearance.


For example, you might only choose to color broken or faded parts of the Jewelry. Or, you might choose to color pieces in a pattern, alternating colors. Another alternative is to color the whole piece. For your first few tries, give everything a trial, so that you can develop your own unique flair; just be sure to use the cheapest items to begin with.;
, If you don't already own them, you'll need to go for a shop. Stick to cheaper brands though, to keep this a budget project.

, Paint slowly and carefully, so as not to drag any polish onto other parts of the Jewelry by mistake.

, Allow each coat to fully dry, then check to see whether you're happy with how the result looks. If you think it needs more depth, add another layer, and repeat until it looks good.

, Paint a clear coat over the top of the Jewelry pieces you've just painted. This can help to keep the color intact for longer.

Attach the cabochon to the tray.,
Allow the cabochon to fully dry in place.,
Wear your new piece of Jewelry with pride.",How to Make Nail Polish Jewelery2," This is a half-circle dome shaped gemstone-cut used for Jewelry making. You'll also need the cabochon tray, which is the metallic part into which the cabochon fits. Both items can be found in such places as craft stores, Jewelry suppliers or online sites that cater to Jewelry making.

, You can hold it in your hand or place it on a concave item, such as a piece of foam with a dent in it. You could also use a big blob of poster tack attached to the rounded part and pressed against a non-slip surface. Use anything that will stop the cabochon from rocking as you work on it.

, If adding glitter, do so now and use the brush to spread it about a bit. Allow to dry. Drying time will take about an hour.


Don't overdo adding the glitter. If it's lumpy, the cabochon won't fit snugly into the tray later.
Instead of painting a layer, you might like to try a design, such as a love heart first, then paint a background layer over the design. This is more finicky but looks really effective.
Another approach is to swirl different colors together across the flat part; take care not to mingle them up too much though, try to keep the swirls distinctive.

, At this stage, it might be enough nail polish but you can decide that once this layer has dried. Two layers is often enough for strong, opaque nail polish colors, while another layer or two might be needed for weaker, more transparent polish colors. Again, allow to dry thoroughly between each layer.

, This will ensure that it is completely dry.

, Use a blob of strong glue and apply this to the tray. Press the flat side of the painted cabochon onto the tray, spreading the glue under the force of your pressure.


If any glue pops up around the edges, simply wipe it away before it dries.

, When it is dry, turn it into a piece of Jewelry, such as a necklace, bracelet, ring or earrings.

, It'll be an unusual piece that nobody else has anywhere.

Get ideas.,
Decide your materials.,
Sketch your image.",How to Make Jewelry1," When designing your own jewelry, you will first want to get ideas. This will help you to think about which design aspects are most important to you and what will best fit your needs.


Look at your collection. Look at your own jewelry, purchased or made by others. You can recreate or take ideas from aspects of pieces you already own and like. Maybe you like a particular type of bead or clasp or color combination. You will also want to look at your own collection to assess if there is a type of jewelry that you might need. Look for holes in your collection, such as a lack of casual pieces for everyday use, and think about what you can make to fill that need.
Look at stores. Go to stores that specialize in jewelry, like Claire’s, or larger stores with jewelry departments, like Macy’s, to get ideas about what you might want to make. The wide selection in stores like these will allow you to get more ideas, as well as helping you stay at the front of fashion trends.
Look at others. You can look at the jewelry your friends have, what you see in magazines and the internet, and what your favorite celebrities are wearing. Think about what you like about their jewelry and what pieces you really wish you had for yourself.
Look at vintage pieces. In looking at vintage pieces and the history of jewelry, you can see a large number of styles very easily. Examine what aspects of the vintage pieces you like to get ideas for design elements you would like to emulate.;
, Once you have decided upon the design aspects you enjoy most and what your needs and desires are, you will want to decide which materials are best for you. Some material choices will be based on taste, some on availability, and some on necessity.


Metals. Metals will usually be used, in the form of wires, chains and rings, to bind together the other elements of the jewelry piece. The type of metal used will depend on what it is being used for, as well as personal taste. For example, soft metals are better for bending and should be used when you need to create loops. Whether or not that metal is gold or copper, however, is up to personal preference.
Stones. You may want to use stones or gemstones in the creation of your jewelry, especially if you are making pendants or rings. Choose your stone largely based on personal taste but be aware that some stones are more expensive than others. You may also wish to use false stones in order to save money. When choosing colors, try to choose those that mimic your natural eye color or fit well with your wardrobe. This will make your jewelry stand out and show off your wonderful design.
Other materials can also be used, depending on the look you are trying to achieve. If metal and gemstone is too traditional for you, try alternative materials like wood, resin, plastic, twine and other less common sources.

, Before you make your jewelry, you will want to sketch out your ideas and then draw your final design. This will let you plan how large or long each element should be and ensure that you have a plan to follow. This will keep you from wasting supplies.


Sketching on graph paper can help you better align design elements and gauge relative sizes. You can also use tools like rulers, stencils, and tracing paper to further hone your drawn designs.

"
"
Get chains.,
Get clasps.,
Think about getting beads.,
Use gems for flourish.,
Buy string.,
Buy wire for structure.,
Buy the right tools.",How to Make Jewelry2," If you do not wish to make a string of beads but would rather attach charms or beads to a chain, then purchasing a chain will be very important. These come in a variety of sizes and can be further trimmed down with wire cutters or pliers.

, There are many different types of claps. You will have to choose what is best for your project, based on what type of jewelry it is as well as the size and weight of the string and beads. Clasps can also be chosen for aesthetic appeal or they can be left simple and downplayed.


Lobster clasp. The most common clasp for necklaces and bracelets in recent years, the lobster clasp is fairly strong and easy to use.
Toggle. Toggles are good for a more streamlined, modern look. They are especially appropriate for pieces with a chunky appearance. These are simple clasps which are easy to use but less secure than some others.
Barrel clasp. This is a very secure clasp which consists of two tube shapes pieces which screw together. It is best used on necklaces, however, as there is a certain level of dexterity involved in closing it.
Hook and eye. A simple clasp and one easily made yourself with the proper tools, the hook and eye consists of a hook and loop. This is less secure and best used on heavy necklaces which have the weight to hold the clasp closed.

, Frequently used in jewelry-making, beads can provide interest for a simple chain or they can be strung together to back up a more opulent pendant. Beads can be inexpensive or pricey depending on their material and they do come in a very wide range of materials.


Beads can be found in all colors and made from ranging materials: plastic, glass, wood, shell, bone, stone, clay, polymer, and a wide variety of other materials as well.

, You may wish to give your jewelry a bit of bling and use either real or fake gemstones. Be sure that if you plan to use stones, you have the proper setting with which to place it on your project. Gems can be relatively less expensive or highly expensive, depending on the size, type and quality of the stone.


Common gemstones used in jewelry include diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, amethyst, opal, and topaz.

, In order to string together beads, charms and pendants, you will need some sort of material that is appropriately strong and flexible. Depending on the weight of your item and how you intend it to be closed, you can use wire, elastic string, twine, fishing line, or any other number of materials.

, You will need larger gauge, much less flexible wire in order to make many components of jewelry items. Examples include chain rings, posts, connecting bars, and spacers. Be sure to check the gauge of wire before purchasing it to be sure that it is right for your project.

, You will want and need several tools in order to make moderate to complex pieces of jewelry. If your project requires working with any metal, tools will certainly be required. Be sure that your tools are high quality and sharp. Dull tools are a common way to hurt yourself.


Get a complete set of pliers. Many different types of pliers are required to create different aspects of jewelry pieces. These include nylon jaw pliers, round nose pliers, chain nose pliers, and bent chain nose pliers.
Scissors and wire cutters. Have tools appropriate and at hand for all of your cutting needs. Scissors should be used for fishing line and elastic string. Always use wire cutters for cutting wire, as attempting to use scissors will likely only end in injury.

"
"
Straighten the wire.,
Cut the wire.,
Bend the wire.,
Make loops.,
Attach clasps.,
Size jewelry.",How to Make Jewelry3," This is the first step in making your own jewelry. If your wire is bent when you cut it, it will also be bent when used to make your jewelry, as it is very difficult to straighten the wire after it has been cut.


Begin by holding the spool with a length of wire unrolled. Using nylon jaw pliers, pull along the length of the wire until it is straight. You can turn the wire or hold it at a different angle occasionally, to ensure that it is straight on all sides.

, You will want to use “flush cutters,” which are specially designed for jewelry making. They allow you to achieve two different ends for the wire by leaving one side flat and one side angled.


Know which side of the cutter results in which type of cut and use it accordingly. Be careful when using these cutters as they are very sharp.
Do not use dull cutters as this is a common way to hurt yourself. If the cutters are not sharp enough, you risk that they will slip on the wire.

, Bending wire at sharp angles is another necessary skill for jewelry making. This is easily accomplished using pliers, preferably bent chain-nose pliers. Simply grasp the wire with the pliers and bend with your finger until the desired angle is achieved.

, You can make loops at the end of a wire very easily. This is useful for making several jewelry components. Begin by grasping the wire with a pair of round nose pliers, such that only a very small amount of wire is poking through the other side of the pliers. Then proceed to bend the wire around the jaw of the pliers until a p-shaped loop is formed.


You can further center this loop by grasping the wire with your round nose pliers at the point where the loop begins and bending it back slightly. This frequently results in the loop opening but it is easy to re-close.

, Attaching a clasp is a necessary finishing process for necklaces and bracelets. The easiest method of attaching a clasp is to use a crimper. When you have finished threading all your beads, place a crimper at the end. Loop the wire through the end loop of the clasp and then back through the crimp bead. Thread the wire through a few of the ending beads, pull tight, close the crimper by squeezing it with the cutters, and then trim the excess wire.

, Necklaces and bracelets should be made according to your personal preference but rings will need to be carefully sized. Use a ring sizer or measure your finger by wrapping it in thread and comparing the measurements against the standard sizes, found easily online.

Finished.

",How to Make Hemp Jewelry," Hemp twine is the basis of the jewelry and it can be found in either an authentic tan color or in any other color that you desire to use. Most jewelry is made using 1 mm or 20 lb twine. However, thicker twines are made, and if you prefer a thicker one, then that will work just as well. Of course, the thicker the twine, the thicker the jewelry will be. Beyond the twine, the only other materials that you will need are based on your preference of whether you want to add beads or charms.
, Knot the 4 strands hemp together with an overhand knot, leaving 2 inches (5.1 cm) at one end.

,


Most hemp jewelry uses basic macrame knotting techniques like the half knot. To do a half knot, cross the left side strand loosely over the other 3 strands, so it looks like the letter ""L."" Bring the right-most strand on top of the left-side strand, then tuck it underneath the 2 center cords and up through the space between the left side strand and the center cords. Hold the center cord taut as you gently pull the 2 outer cords snug against the previous knot. This is called a left half knot; doing the mirror-image process, starting with the right side cord, creates a right half knot.
Do a chain of same-side half knots to create a spiral cord, or alternate right and left half-knots so your hemp chain lies flat.
You can also use the classic ""friendship bracelet wrap"" to create a knotted hemp cord. Cross 1 side strand loosely over the other strands as if you were beginning a half knot. Then bring the end of that same side strand underneath the middle strands and up through the space between the side strand and the middle strands, almost like a figure-4. Hold the middle strands taut as you gently tighten the wrapped side strand against the previous knot.

, Tie at least 1 knot, using the outside-edge cords, between each bead.

,,, Sliding the 2 knots apart automatically tightens your jewelry piece.

Jewelry making kits provide you with basic supplies and tools that allow you to customize different jewelry pieces and make them all your own. Most kits come with some basic instructions with different jewelry ideas, but you can use your imagination to create whatever kind of jewelry you want.


There are many variations of jewelry making kits depending on what specific kind of jewelry you want to make.
For example, there are beading jewelry kits, stringing jewelry kits, and wire jewelry kits, just to name a few.;
, Because there is such a variety in possible pieces of jewelry (necklaces, bracelets, earrings), made out of many possible materials (beads, wire, string, resin, paper, etc.), pick out a material and piece of jewelry you want to work on making. Find inspiration by visiting jewelry stores or looking online at social platforms, visual organizational websites, or jewelry retailer websites., Depending on what kind of jewelry you plan to make, you’ll probably need some basic tools to complete your project.Some basic tools all beginners should consider having include:


A variety of pliers – round nose pliers, chain nose pliers, step jaw pliers, bent closing pliers, and nylon jaw pliersA metal ruler that measures both centimeters and inches
Wire cuttersPractice wire, to practice bending and shaping you wire before you attempt to bend your more expensive wire for your actual projectPeg boards for bending wire, Handmade jewelry can be crafted with many different kinds of supplies, but there are a few basic supplies that are used on most handmade jewelry pieces. Jewelry kits can provide you with general or project specific supplies, but if you plan to start making jewelry without using a kit, you need to purchase some supplies on your own.Consider buying some:


BeadsJewelry wire in common gauge sizes (18, 20, and 22); 20 gauge is best for beginnersHeadpins for earringsClasps and closuresJump rings, In order to determine how big or small you want your jewelry piece to be, familiarize yourself with some basic jewelry measurements. There are common, standard sizes for necklaces, and bracelets (depending on if the jewelry is for men or women), and how long you want the piece to hang.For example, different necklace styles are certain lengths. Chokers are about 14 – 16 inches in length, princess style necklaces are about 17 – 19 inches in length, and rope necklaces are about 34 inches in length and longer.Necklaces that fall just below the collar bone tend to measure about 17 inches for women, and about 20 inches for men.Common bracelet lengths measure about 7 inches for women, and between 8 – 11 inches for men., In order to begin the process of making your own jewelry piece, you must learn some basic skills and techniques in order to successfully complete your project. Common skills and techniques that must be learned include opening jump rings, cutting wire, wire working, stringing, and using jigs and pegs, just to name a few.To learn these different techniques you can read jewelry making books, search for tutorials, and take jewelry making workshops.
Search online for instructions on how to make the the specific earrings, bracelet, ring, or other kind of jewelry you want to try making.

, Once you have a chosen jewelry project that you want to make, gather and assemble all of the needed materials.Again, your materials can come from a jewelry making kit, or you can research a style of jewelry, determine the level of difficulty, and then buy the necessary materials yourself.


For example, in order to start making charm earrings, you first have to select the charms you want to use.Charms can be found online, at craft stores, or jewelry stores. Then you have to select your earring findings, which are the parts of the earring that fit through your ear piercing.
When you are ready to begin making your jewelry, go over the instructions that you have acquired on how to make the jewelry piece., As mentioned earlier, for wire jewelry, having practice wire is a good idea to practice and conquer a jewelry making technique before you move on to bending and cutting your more expensive wire.That way, you get the hang of the technique with lots of repetition, so your final product is of high quality.


No matter what kind of jewelry material you are using, always try to practice the technique first, before using your actual, precious jewelry materials.
Thin, copper wire is always a good choice for practice wire., These earrings are fairly simple to make, and only require two crystals for your charms, two jump rings, and two earring findings.You will also need a set of pliers to help open and close the jewelry pieces.

, Use your pliers to twist and open up the two jump rings. Feed the crystals onto the jump rings through the holes in the charms.Be sure that if you crystals have a distinct front and back side, that the front side will be showing forward once you close the jump ring and put on the earring. If not, you can always reopen the jump ring and turn the crystal around on the ring.

, Once the crystals are on the jump rings, slide the earring findings onto the jump rings. You should be able to hold a jump ring and have both the crystal and earring finding hanging off. Use your pliers to close and secure the jump rings.


This earring project can take less than five minutes, and at the end, you have a unique pair of beautiful earrings., A simple beaded bracelet is a great way to begin making handmade bracelets. For this bracelet you will need beads of your choosing, beading wire, wire cutters, crimp beads, jump rings, and a closing clasp., Begin by stringing your beads onto the wire still attached to the spool. Keeping the wire attached to the spool allows you to change your mind about the length of the bracelet as you make it.Keep stringing on beads until you make the bracelet as long as you like.

, Figure out how much length the clasp and jump ring are going to add to your final product bracelet, take that into consideration, and remove some beads equivalent to that length., Add on a crimp bead and a jump ring to the end of your bracelet. Leave yourself a bit of room on the end of the wire. Take the tag end of the wire and thread it back through the end crimp bead.You want the jump ring to be dangling on the wire loop.

, Keep threading the wire through the rest of the beads until the jump ring is pulled taut against the wire. Use your crimping pliers to clamp down on the crimp bead and secure the crimp bead.You can also trim away the excess wire near the crimp bead so you don’t get poked. Repeat this process with the other side of bracelet.
Add a clasp to an end of the bracelet. Add a clasp onto one of the end jump rings by using pliers to twist and open a jump ring, and then feed the clasp onto the ring.Close the jump ring, and connect your bracelet together.
This same technique can be used with longer wire and more beads to make a simple necklace.

, A beaded ring is a really easy and simple project for a beginning jewelry maker. For a beaded ring, you will need some small, glass, seed beads, nylon fishing line to serve as your ring thread, and some bead glue., Begin with approximately 10 – 12 inches of ring thread. Feed on three small glass beads in any color of your choosing.


When the three beads are on the thread, hold the two ends of the thread together and allow the beads to fall to the middle of the thread., Add a fourth bead to one of the thread ends, but do not let it fall down to meet the rest of the beads. Instead, take the other end of the ring thread, and feed it through the top of the bead.The two bracelet threads should now be coming out from opposite directions from the bead. Pull the threads outward in opposite directions to string the bead into place.This fourth bead will act as a bridge between the other beads.

, Add one bead each to the different thread ends. Then add a third bead to act as the connecting, bridge bead.Like you did before, feed both ends of the ring thread through the bead (threading the thread in opposite directions), and pull the thread ends away to secure the bead.


Keep adding beads in this manner until the length of the ring becomes long enough to wrap around your finger.You can intermittently check the length of the ring by wrapping it around your finger. Just make sure you hold onto the loose end of the ring.

, Pass the two loose ends of the ring thread through the hole in the very first bead of the ring.Consider repeating threading the ring thread through the bead to make the connection more secure. Tie the thread ends in a knot to finish the ring.Trim off any excess fishing line thread, and consider adding a drop of glue to the thread ends to make sure they stay connected."

Tie and cut.",How to Make Ankle Bracelets1," To make your ankle bracelet, you will need string. You can use one color, or an assortment. You’ll need three pieces of string for this type of ankle bracelet. You can find the string at craft stores. When picking out the colors, be sure to choose a set that either means something to the person you’re making the ankle bracelet for or simply goes well together.


Colorful string
Scissors
Tape-measure
Safety pin or tape;
, Using your tape measure, tape around the spot on your ankle where you want your ankle bracelet to sit. Next, add 6 inches (15.2 cm) to this measurement. This gives you plenty of room to tie the ankle bracelet. Cut your string here., Tie all three of your strings together in one knot at the end. Leave an inch above the knot so that you can tie it again after you complete your ankle bracelet.

, Use tape or a safety pin to anchor your string. Attaching it to something steady will make it much easier to work with. You can attach it to anything that will hold it still.


The leg of your pants
A binder
The table
A pillow

, With your strings anchored, knot at the top, grab hold of two strings. Hold these straight and wrap your third string around these two and pull it into a knot. You’ll be able to see the knot on the side of the string. Using this same thread, repeat this step 10-15 times.Be sure to hold your two center strings as straight and tight as possible. This will make tying the knots easier because it will keep them out of the way of your staircase.

, It’s just that easy—pick your next color string after you’ve reached the length you want for the first one. Hold the other two straight and use your new color to tie a knot around them. Repeat this for 10-15 knots. Continue this staircase for the length of your ankle.


If you notice that a knot isn’t sitting correctly, you can easily undo it. However, this gets more and more difficult because your staircase gets tighter as you go; so pay attention and catch the mistake early.

, Once you have approximately 4 extra inches of string, test the length of your ankle bracelet. If it is not yet long enough, continue your staircase and check again after you complete a color.

, Now that your ankle bracelet is long enough, tie it around your ankle, or the ankle of the person you’re giving it to. Use a strong knot and cut the excess string away.

Measure your string.,
Find the center of your ankle bracelet.,
Thread your center bead.,
Use a toothpick.,
Measure ½” from your center bead.,
Continue beading.,
Test the length.,
Use a clasp.",How to Make Ankle Bracelets2," One piece will most likely be too weak to hold beads, using two or three strings will lengthen the lifetime of your beaded ankle bracelet. Cut your string at your ankle length.

, Do this by taking all three pieces of your string and lining them up. Now fold them in half. Mark this spot with a pen.

, Choose which bead you want in the center of your ankle bracelet and slide it onto the string. Move it down to the point that you just marked and tie knots on either side of it. This is now your center bead.


Beads can represent your outfit, mood, or personality. Choose beads that convey the message that you want.

, In order to slide the rest of your beads onto your ankle bracelet, fold your string over a toothpick. This will be thin enough for your beads to fit over, but strong enough to keep your string from fraying at the ends.

, Using your tape measure, mark ½” away from your center bead in both directions. Tie a knot at this spot and slide your next bead onto your ankle bracelet. Knot it again after the bead is in place.

, Keep measuring ½” from each bead and fill your ankle bracelet with evenly spaced beads. Be sure to knot each one on both sides of the bead so that they stay where you want them.

, Once you have beaded your ankle bracelet until there is approximately 2” of thread left on each side, test the length around your ankle. If you want to add one, or you need to take one off, now is the time for those adjustments.

, For a beaded ankle bracelet, it is smart to use a clasp because the beads are heavier than just the string. A lobster clasp is the best for an ankle bracelet and is easily tied onto each side.You don’t necessarily have to use a clasp, but it extend the life of your beaded ankle bracelet if you do.

Draw your pattern on a sheet of paper.,
Tape a sheet of wax paper over the pattern.,
Tape a piece of sheer fabric over the wax paper.,
Trace over the lines with puff paint.,
Add a rhinestone spider, if desired.,
Let the puff paint dry completely.,
Cut the spider web out.,
Glue some ribbon to the back of the necklace so that you can tie it.Cut two long pieces of thin ribbon.",How to Make Spider Web Jewelry1," Start with a curved line for the top part of the necklace—use the collar from a shirt or sweater as a template. Draw at least seven, evenly spaced lines radiating downward from the collar. Make the one at the center the longest and the ones at the edges the shortest. Connect them with a series of slightly-curved lines.


Go over the lines using a black marker. This will make the pattern more visible in the later steps.;
, The wax paper will make it easier to remove the necklace when you are done. If you don't have any wax paper, you can use parchment paper instead.If you wish to use hot glue, you must use parchment paper.

, Tulle would work best for this, but you can use another sheer fabric, such as chiffon. You want the fabric to be barely visible against your skin or costume.If you wish to use hot glue, you can skip this step, and draw directly on the parchment paper., You may also find it labeled as ""dimensional fabric paint"". For an extra-spooky effect, use glow-in-the-dark puff paint.You can also use hot glue, but make sure that you are using parchment paper. Wax paper will melt if you use it with hot glue.

, Glue a large, oval rhinestone and a smaller, round rhinestone to the web. The oval rhinestone will make the body, and the round rhinestone will make the head. Outline both with puff paint, then add eight legs to the oval rhinestone. You can use glow-in-the-dark puff paint or black puff paint for this.


Make a simpler spider using puff paint and no rhinestones.

, This may take several hours to overnight. Refer to the drying times on the label of the product you are using. If you are using hot glue, the drying time will only be a few minutes.

, Only cut along the outer edges of the spider web. Don't cut out the small spaces inside the web., Glue the end of each ribbon to each end of your spider web. Be sure to glue the ribbon to the underside, so that the ends won't be visible. You can use hot glue or fabric glue for this.


Choose a ribbon color that goes well with your spider web.
The thinner ribbon you use for this, the better.
If you are using hot glue, you can punch holes to either end of the spider web, and thread the ribbon through them instead."

Twist open a jump ring.,
Slip the web and an earring hook onto the jump ring.,
Close the jump ring.,
Repeat the process to make a earring web.,
Add some details, if desired.",How to Make Spider Web Jewelry2," Keep the web around 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) wide. You want it to be small enough to work as a nice set of earrings, but not so small that you can't outline it with hot glue.


If you don't know how to draw a spider web, print out an outline of one from the internet.
Go over your lines with a black marker to ensure that they are visible.

, This will make it easier to remove the spider webs when you are done. Avoid using wax paper.The heat of the glue gun will cause the wax to melt and fuse with the spider webs.

, You can use plain hot glue sticks for this, or you can use colored ones. Black would look great for this. You can also use glitter hot glue sticks for something more sparkly. If you are lucky, you might even be able to find glow-in-the-dark hot glue sticks!

, Black, orange, or purple glitter would work especially well here. Glow-in-the-dark glitter would also work, if you can find it. Be sure to work quickly, however; hot glue sets fast!If you used glitter hot glue, you probably don't need to do this since your web will be already sparkly.

, If you used plain hot glue, you can add color to your web by painting it. Give it a coat of spray paint in whatever color you want, then let the paint dry. Glow-in-the-dark paint would look great!


Don't paint the spider web if you added glitter to it. The paint would cover the glitter.

, You can tell if the glue is set once it turns hard and opaque. Lift a corner of the web off of the parchment paper, then carefully peel it away.


If you used glitter on your web, be sure to put it back into its jar.

, Find a small jump ring. Grab one end of it with a pair of needle nose pliers. Grab the other end with your fingers or a second pair of needle nose pliers. Carefully twist the two ends of the jump ring past each other, like opening a door. Do not pull them away from each other., Find one of the outermost strands on your web, and slip it onto the jump ring. Next, slip an earring hook onto the jump ring. Be sure to use a color that matches the jump ring. If you used a silver jump ring, use a silver earring hook.

, Use the same technique as you did when opening it. Grab one end with a pair of needle nose pliers, and the other end with your fingers or a second pair of pliers. Twist the two ends towards each other, like shutting a door. If there is a small gap in the jump ring, pinch it shut with your finger tips., If the parchment paper is too dirty to work on, pull it off and tape a fresh sheet down on top. You can make the second earring exactly like the first one, or vary the design a little.

, At this point, your earrings are done. You can, however, hot glue a little spider charm to each web. This will give the webs that final, spooky touch.


Make your own spider. Hot glue an oval rhinestone, then use glitter glue to draw some legs and a head.
Hot glue tends to leave behind little strands. You can pull these off, or leave them on for a more web-like feel.

Measure and cut a 50-inch (127-centimeter) long piece of 26-gauge wire. You can use any color of wire you want, but black or silver would look best for this project., Hold the three short wires together and find the middle. Place the long wire behind them, a with 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long tail sticking out from beneath. Wrap the long wire four times around the bundle., If the stub that's left on the bundle is sharp, carefully press it down using a pair of needle nose pliers. Do not cut off the rest of the long wire.

, Take the three 22-gauge wires, and spread them out evenly to form a star or ""*"" shape. They may slip and slide through the wrapped wire, so make sure that they are all the same length.

, Once the spokes are the way you want them, weave the long wire over and under them, like making a basket. Keep doing this until you are back where you started, then repeat for a second round.Push the long wire down into the crevices every so often.
Keep the long wire pulled nice and taut.

, Bring the long wire under the next spoke and pull it taut. Bring it up, over, and around the spoke. Give it a gentle tug, and push the wrapped part down. Move onto the next spoke.

, Keep the spokes nice and straight, and the long wire pulled taut. Remember to push the wrapped ""knots"" down to the previous one. If the web starts to warp, pinch it between your thumb and fore finger., When the wire is too short to reach the next spoke, you are done weaving. Use a pair of needle nose pliers to wrap it tightly around the current spoke three times., Use you pair of flush wire cutters for this. You will have long spokes sticking out all around the web. Don't cut these off just yet.

, Squeeze a pair of wire looping pliers over the last spoke you wrapped, close to the ""knot."" Pull the tail-end of the spoke down behind the looping wires, towards the center of the web.If you can't find any wire looping pliers, you will need to trim the spokes down, and wrap them using a pair of round nose plies.

, Bring the tail-end of the loop towards you, then wrap it around the ""neck"" of the loop. Trim the tail-end off. If you need to, use your needle nose pliers to tuck in any sharp ends. Remove the wire looping pliers when you are done.This wrapped loop will be the top of your earring or pendant.

, Use a pair of needle nose pliers to open up an earring hook. Slide the two ends past each other, not away. Slip the loop onto the hook, then close the hook by pushing the ends back towards each other.


If you wish to make a pendant, use a large jump ring instead. Slip the jump ring onto a plain necklace.

, You do not have to wrap the tail-end around the neck of each loop this time. Simply, make the loop, close it, and trim off the tail., Use a pair of needle nose pliers to twist open the loop on the bottom of your earring. Slip a spider charm onto it, then twist the loop back shut.Some charms have big, clunky jump rings. If your charm has one, you might want to remove it first. This will make your earrings look nicer.

, You can have the second earring match the first one, or you can make it a little different. For example, you can use a different spider charm, or you can skip it altogether.

Cut the end of the thread close to the fabric.,Done








",How to Ladder Stitch," A ladder stitch brings two areas of the hem together to match a project that has been sewn inside out to create a hem. The area you use to turn the project right side out will be the area you will ladder stitch.






;
, You may need to pop the corners out with a sewing needle through the entry point. You may also need to stuff the inside of the project before sewing up this last part of the hem.







, You want it to match the seam allowance on both sides of the stitch. If it doesn’t stay turned inward very easily, you can iron the open section so that it will lay flat while it is turned in.








, If possible, hook your pin through the rough edge of the hem on the inside of the opening. It will be less likely to poke through and reveal your stitches later on.








, You will want to double thread it for extra strength. Pull an eight-inch to one-foot section (20 to 30 cm) of thread through the eye of your needle.









Then, pull it until the ends meet and the needle is in the middle. Knot it several times at the ends.
Test the knot by pulling it between two fingernails. The knot should be tight and strong.
Snip off the threads below the knot. Leave about one cm (0.4 in) of thread remaining.

, Pull it up through the machine stitch and ensure the knot is secure and hidden between the folds of the project before continuing.








, Make sure they are perfectly matched at the point where the machine stitch stopped. Think of the two folds as the right and the left side of “the ladder” the makes the stitch.








, It is important to always insert the needle through the inside edge of the fabric, where the hem was folded inward. It ensures that your stitch is hidden within the fold, rather than showing on the outside edge of the fabric.








, Pull it through the center.








, Pull it through toward the center.








,, Stitch into it to connect the stitches on either side.








, The thread should close your stitch and hide the ladder stitch you just made within the fold of the hem. Pinch the thread and fabric where it emerges so that you don’t lose any of the tension before you secure the stitch.







, Thread your needle through the loop and pull it taut.









Repeat several times to secure it.

, Tuck the ends into the fold.

Undo your basting stitches.",How to Sew a Fly Zipper," All fabric has a direction, which refers to how the grain line of the fabric moves. When cutting your fabric, you want to make sure you're cutting in the direction of the grain line. If you're not, this could result in a tight, ill-fitting final product.








Stretch out either end of your fabric. One end of fabric should stretch out slightly further.
The side that stretches further is your fabric's direction. You'll want to cut in the direction of the stretcher side when cutting your fabric.;
, With a fly zipper, you'll need to sew it into two matching pieces of fabric. These pieces of fabric make up the front of your pants, or skirt. You should use a pattern here, especially if you're new to sewing. The precise size you'll need will depend on your measurements, or the measurements of the person who you're making the outfit for.








On a fly zipper, each pant front has an outward flap. This is a small, somewhat rectangular curved portion of fabric that sticks out from the edge of the pant fronts. You will sew the zipper into these flaps, as they will eventually form the fly of the pants.
Your pants fronts will essentially be two rectangles of equal size. Each rectangle will have one outward flap. The flaps should also be of equal size. One rectangle should have an outward flap on the top right corner. The other should have an outward flap on the top left corner.

, You will want to sew the two pant fronts together. You will be sewing together the sides containing the outwards flaps. Consult your pattern here. The seam line should be drawn about half an inch into the pant flap, leaving some overlap between each flap. The precise overlap depends on your pattern's requirements.








Use a pen to draw the seam line. Make sure you draw the line on the backside of the fabric. This is the side of the fabric that will face your body when you wear the outfit. It is usually a duller color than the front side of the fabric.
The seam line is a straight line that runs along the long side of each pant front. Use a ruler to keep your seam line as straight as possible.

, You want to baste a certain portion of the seam line. You baste this portion as basting stitches can be undone easily. The basting line will be removed once the fly zipper is installed.You will start sewing at the bottom of the pant fronts and sew upward towards the outward flaps. At a certain point, you will stop sewing and begin basting.
Consult your pattern to see how many inches you sew upward before you begin basting. Find the point where you begin basting with a ruler and mark it with a pen. You can mark the beginning of the baste line with a dot, a horizontal line, or another marking of your choosing.

, Take your two front pieces. Place them on top of one another, with the front sides of the fabric touching. Make sure you line up the front pieces so they're matching. If you look at your lined up front pieces from an eagle eye view, they should look like a single piece of fabric.







, Start at the bottom of the seam line. Do regular sewing, preferably using a sewing machine, until you reach the marker that indicates you've reached the basting line.








Make sure to use the same color thread as the fabric you're using. If you don't have the right color handy, go one shade darker rather than one shade lighter. This will look less awkward when you complete the project.Once you reach this marker, you'll want to back stitch slightly. This means you'll sew backward for an inch or so, sewing over the stitches you've already made.

, Once you've reached the baste line, switch to a basting stitch. Continue basting until you reach the top of the pant fronts. A basting stitch is a light, simple stitch that can easily be undone.








To do a basting stitch, you sew in a straight line and weave the needle in and out of the fabric. Press the needle through the underside of the fabric and pull it out onto the upper side. Then, move the needle forward about half an inch.
Push the needle through the upper side of the fabric and pull it out onto the underside. Try to keep the space between stitches as even as possible as you work.
Repeat this process until you've reached the top of the basting line. A basting stitch should look like a dotted line running along the fabric.

, Once your pant flaps are sewn together, spread them apart. This is sort of like opening a book or newspaper. When spread apart, the pant fronts should form a rectangular shape. Place the now connected pant fronts on a flat surface, with the underside of the fabric pointed upward. You will notice the outward flaps have spread apart and form a circular shape on the top of the pant fronts. You should also notice the seam.








Remember, the seam line was drawn about half an inch into each pant front. Two strips of fabric should be pressed against each other, running down the center of the connected pant fronts to form a vertical line.
You'll want to separate these strips of fabric. Like spreading the pant fronts apart, this is like opening a book or newspaper. When you've separated the strips, flatten them against the pant fronts.
When you're finished, there should be two rectangular strips of fabric side-by-side that run down the center of the connected pant fronts.

, Take your zipper tape and place it on the top of your pant fronts. The zipper tape should lie on the left outward flap. The right side of the zipper tape should line up with the basting line.








The actual zipper handle, found on the end of the zipper line, should not be on the edge of your pant fronts. You'll eventually add a waist line to your pants, where you'll likely add a button.There should be a few inches of loose zipper line between the end of the pant fronts and the zipper's handle.

, Once your zipper is in the proper place, take some pins. Use these pins to secure the zipper in place.








It's a good idea to place the pins parallel to the seam. They will be easier to remove, and stay in place more., Grab onto the left outward flap. This is the outward flap to which the zipper line is now pinned. Pull the outward flap upward. Then, press the pant fronts together, like you did when you initially sewed them. The pant fronts should be on top of one another, with the left outward flap sticking out to the left. You want to separate this outward flap from the actual pant fronts so you can sew the zipper into this flap.







, From here, you'll want to begin the process of sewing the zipper to your pants. You'll want to first sew the left side of the zipper line onto the outward flap. This should be the side of the zipper line closest to the curved outward flap. Do not sew the side of the zipper line closest to the pant fronts.








Sew the zipper onto the outward flap by sewing the length of the basting line.
Start at the bottom of the zipper line and work your way up to the top.

, Pull the zipper line upward. Fold the pants fronts in half, dividing them by the zipper line. The idea here is to get the bulk of the fabric out of the way so you're just targeting the zipper and a small portion of pant fabric when you sew next. You should be left with a rectangular shape of layered fabric, with the zipper line sticking out its left side.







, A small amount of fabric should be folded over the right side of the zipper line. Along this fold of fabric, you will see one of the basting lines you originally drew. Sew along this fold, following the basting line. This will help secure the zipper in place further.







, From here, reach underneath the folded fabric. You should feel the right outward flap. Move this flap out from under the folded portion of fabric. Lie it flat against the table.







, Pin the zipper line onto the right outward flap. Then, sew the right side of the zipper line into the right outward flap. Once again, sew the zipper line on the side facing the outward flap.







, Unfold the skirt. Lie it flat on the table, this time having the front side of the fabric facing upward. Use your fingers to feel where the zipper tape runs down the underside of the fabric. Pin all the layers of the skirt together in a line that runs down the zipper line.







, When sewing a fly zipper, there is a line called the top stitching line. This is a line on the front side of the fabric you need to stitch. Consult your pattern to find where to draw your top stitching line.








If you're not following a pattern, the top stitching line mirrors the shape of the left outward flap. You can feel for where the flap falls with your fingers, and trace its outline using a fabric pen.
Make sure to choose an erasable fabric pen to draw this line. This portion of the skirt will be visible, so you want a line you can remove later.

, Take a needle and thread. Starting at the top, sew along the top stitching line. Sew until you feel the edge of the zipper line. Stop here.







, You're almost done. Once you've sewn the stitching line, all you have to do is remove the basting stitches you made when first sewing the pant fronts together. You can use a tool called a seam ripper, which you can purchase at any craft store.








Gently slip the seam ripper below each stitch on the basting line. Pull the stitches until the thread breaks. Then, remove any excess bits of thread with your fingers. You may have to use a pair of scissors to trim any lingering thread still stuck to the fabric.
You should now have a fly zipper securely sewed to your pant fronts. The fly on your pants will be completed.

Follow the instructional manual.,
Go slowly.,
Prepare the machine for cleaning.,
Take a small, stiff lint brush.,
Use compressed air.,
Buy sewing machine oil.,
Put drops of oil into sewing machine parts.,
Wipe away excess oil.,
Oil a Singer sewing machine.",How to Oil a Sewing Machine," Each sewing machine brand is different, so it’s a good idea to check the manual that came with your sewing machine for directions on how to clean and oil the machine.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning the machine after every 10 hours you use it. Clean it when you see lint starting to gather. Some older machines mark the spots where you should drop oil in red. Others tell you where to drop it using pictures to guide you.
If you don’t have a copy of the instructional manual, you should be able to get one on the manufacturer’s website. You might even be able to download it. If that doesn’t work, call the manufacturer and ask for one. You will be asked the machine name, model, and serial number most likely. You could also ask a local dealer.Some machines do not need to be oiled. They are self-lubricating. Such a machine will still need to be maintained, but if it says not to oil it at home, don’t.;
, You want to make sure that you don’t use too much oil. It’s a good idea to use a little bit of oil, and see how it works. Then use more. Place a piece of newspaper under the machine while you work.


Oil small areas at a time. You should take apart small areas of the machine piece-by-piece to oil them. Study the instructional manual drawings first so that you understand the function and name of each part.
Disassemble the parts following the instructions in your manual. You will want to follow a process of cleaning the piece, brushing it out, and then lubricating each area.
After you finish with each area of the sewing machine, you will want to put it back together, and then move on to the next part. Replace needles frequently. You will probably want to do this with each new project.

, You should clean the machine before you oil it. First, turn off the machine and unplug it.


Remove all of the extra pieces of the machine that will get in the way of a thorough cleaning. For example, remove thread, bobbin cases, plates, and the presser foot.
Remove the stitch plate. If your machine has a bobbin hook, you should remove it because lint could be collected there. Remove the machine’s needle for safety purposes.

, You should be able to brush away the lint with the stiff lint brush. Brush away the lint that you can. Sometimes these small lint brushes and other cleaning materials will come with the sewing machine.


To reach pieces of lint that are hard to sweep away because they are compacted, try using tweezers to remove them. It's essential that you thoroughly clean your machine before you apply the oil.
Try using a soft cloth to wipe away any lint or residue on the bobbin hook. Some people also use clean mascara brushes or pipe cleaners for this process.

, You could clean parts of the machine with a can of compressed air. There are some cautions necessary with using compressed air, though.


The problem with canned air is that it could blow lint deeper in the machine. To reduce this problem, hold the nozzle at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) away from the machine part, and spray air at an angle into the machine so it blows the lint out of the machine instead of into it.
Use the air to clean the bobbin case area and the bobbin case itself. This is the area where the bobbin loads up. Stray dust should fall out.Use the air to clean the bobbin case also.
Clean under the needle plate also. You will have to unscrew the needle plate. Remove the plate. You will see dust inside of it. Spray the area with the compressed air. Clean any other parts as instructed by your sewing machine manual.

, You cannot use car oil. You need to buy oil that is specifically for sewing machines. Sewing machine oil is clear and comes in a small bottle.


Your sewing machine may have come with a bottle of oil when you purchased it from the dealer or store.
You can find this oil in sewing and fabric shops. This cannot be said enough. You cannot use any other oil than the oil recommended in your owner’s manual.
Household oil or WD-40 will not work. Sewing machine oil is of different consistency than oil you’d put in a car. It’s clear and lighter. , You should only need a small amount of oil. Your owner’s manual will tell you where to drop it in the machine. It only takes a couple of drops.


Generally, you will be told to squeeze a few drops of oil on the housing unit that the bobbin case sits in.Most machines want you to oil the shuttle hook (which is the thing that spins inside the bobbin casing). Often you will be told to drop oil inside the hook race and the housing of the sewing machine. That’s the silver ring that the bobbin hook fits into. Your machine will perform better and be quieter if you drop oil here because the two pieces rub together.
You may also be instructed to put a drop of oil on the outer ring of the bobbin hook. This is where it slides along the hook race., You could leave a piece of fabric under the presser foot to soak up any excess oil. You don’t want oil to stain your next project when you start stitching.


Take a cloth, and wipe away excess oil. Otherwise, it could end up on your fabric and thread. Put your parts back together. Avoid oiling plastic parts.If you use too much oil, you can run muslin through the machine, and then wipe the exterior of the machine. Use a damp, soapy towel. Let it sit. That way the oil will collect. Then, do it again. You might need to do this a few times over the subsequent days until all of the extra oil is not in the machine.
Test the machine. Before you start sewing a new project, make a few stitches on a piece of fabric you don’t care about. You want to see if any excess oil remains. Screw the needle plate back into the sewing machine.

, Remove the needle plate. Turn the handwheel towards yourself until the needle is fully raised and open the hinged front cover. Unscrew the needle plate screws. A screw driver will come with the machine.


Clean the feed dog. Remove the bobbin. Use the brush supplied to clean the area. Remove the bobbin case. Snap the two hook retaining arms outwards. Remove the hook cover and the hook. Clean with a soft cloth.
Lubricate the points in the instructional manual with 1-2 drops of sewing machine oil. Turn the handwheel until the hook race is in the left position. Replace the hook. Replace the hook cover, and snap back the hook retaining arms. Insert the bobbin case and bobbin and replace the stitch plate. "

Remember to sew so that your seam allowances stay the same as the rest of the garment.









This may seem counterintuitive but remember that a basting stitch is only temporary. It is used here simply to keep your seam in place. You will remove it after you have attached your zipper.;
, Be sure to get the seam allowance pieces as open and flat as possible, as the folds on either side of the basting stitch will need to be nice and crisp.








, Install the zipper in its closed position. Position the top of the zipper so the pull is just above the top line of the garment.









Any excess zipper that is laying below the end of the seam is not a problem. You want a little bit extending down, perhaps an inch or so, but any length in excess of that can be removed. Just cut off the excess zipper before you pin the zipper on and whip stitch the end to make a zipper stop.

, Once again, the basting stitch will be removed later, it is just used here to keep the zipper in place. These basting stitches are necessary because they will keep the teeth of the zipper centered on the seam when you can't actually see the zipper as you sew over the right side of the project.








, You should only see the top of the zipper sticking out the top of your project. The rest of the zipper should be hidden away.








,









You will need to finish the sewing by putting a line of stitches across the bottom of the seam. This will give your zipper an end point which the pull cannot go below.

, Begin by taking out the basting stitches that kept the zipper in place. Once those are removed, take out the basting stitches that go down the middle of the seam. This should expose the teeth of your zipper underneath.









When taking out your basting stitches, be careful not to snag thread in your fabric or any of your permanent top stitches. A seam ripper is a great tool but it can easily cut threads that you don't want it to, so be careful.

, It should open and close smoothly and be centered nicely in your seam.








, Zippers come in a wide variety of colors, styles, and sizes. Pick the one that works best for your project.


If you can't find a zipper that is the perfect length, purchase a zipper that is slightly longer than the seam opening you want to put it in.This will give you some leeway in positioning the zipper and will help you avoid hitting the end stop of the zipper with your sewing needle, which would break it.

, This is only necessary if your zipper is made of natural materials. Simply follow package recommendations, as most zippers are made from man-made materials but some are made from natural fibers such as cotton.

, Use a gentle heat to prevent melting the zipper if the teeth are made of plastic.









Zippers with metal teeth can stand up to more heat from an iron.

, This is only necessary if you are using a lightweight fabric that is not very strong or stiff. The interfacing will be used to make it stronger and stiffer, better able to handle the repetitive pressure that is caused by a zipper being opened and closed.








, In most cases you will simply place the thin strips of interfacing on the wrong side of your fabric right next to the seam. You will then iron over the fabric and interfacing, which will attach the interfacing to the fabric.

The first choice, in machine sewing a seam, is to align the edge of the fabric on the seam guide plate or the presser foot.,
When sewing a difficult seam create a line on the fabric and sew on the line instead of aligning the the fabric on the seam guide plate or the presser foot.,
To sew a seam directly on a line, make a line with either a ball point pen or wax pencil.,
Use chalk and a straight edge to make a line but do not sew on the line.,
Before starting, you must:


Have excellent lighting: overhead lighting, the light from the sewing machine and a table lamp.,
Apply this to sewing curves.

",How to Sew a Perfect Seam,";
, Use this method if the seam will be very close to the fabric edge, if you are not very skilled, or if the fabric is very thick or uneven.

, The line made by chalk will be wider and more irregular than the wax pencil The ball point pen makes a durable and fine line. Use the wax pencil on fine or smooth fabrics only when sewing directly over the line, because with coarse fabrics the line will be blotchy. With a wax pencil always keep the point small to make a fine line.

, Instead sew on the edge of the chalk markings. This method can be done with a wax pencil on rough fabrics. Since chalk is not durable, handle the fabric with care.

,
Measure
Iron and allow the fabric dry.
Pin, baste, pin and baste, or double baste depending on what is needed.
Test removing the wax or ink. Use undiluted rubbing alcohol and on a dry fabric only. After working the rubbing alcohol, into the fabric, rinse the alcohol out by placing it under running water.
Have some sewing skills by practicing on easier projects.

,

Continue doing this process with all of the loops, hooking only the corner ones back onto their loop after they've been crocheted.,
Lift the potholder off of the loom, and stretch it out vertically, horizontally, diagonally, and all other ways you can think of.,

Enjoy your potholder, and make many more (optional)!
",How to Make Potholders2," A classic pattern is the puzzle piece (shown). And if you have a variety of potholders, or are hoping to use up your leftovers, look into the one that is shown in the step-by-step pictures. You simply loop a pattern of color that looks pleasing to you one direction, and in the other, choose one basic color (like black or white) and loop only that color. For more pattern ideas, look online!,,,,, If they do this, use your nails to push them back.,,,,, This will stretch out your potholder, preventing their tendency to shrink during the crocheting process., You should also try to loosen up the corner pieces a little, so that they don't stick out too much.,"

Try on the shirt.",How to Sew a Shirt," The easiest way to draft your own shirt pattern will be to copy the shape of an existing shirt that fits well.


While this tutorial only covers t-shirt drafting and construction, you can follow the same basic steps to help draft patterns for other shirt styles.;
, Fold the shirt in half vertically, keeping the front sides out. Lay the halved shirt over a large sheet of paper.


Ideally, you should place the paper over thick cardboard before placing the shirt on top. The cardboard will provide a stiff enough work surface to trace over. Moreover, you'll need to stick pins into the paper, and doing so will be easier to accomplish with cardboard backing.

, Pin along the perimeter of the shirt, paying special attention to the back neckline seam beneath the collar and the sleeve seam.The pins you insert along the shoulder seam, sides, and bottom hem do not need to be precise since their main purpose is to hold the shirt down.
For the sleeve seam, stick the pins straight down through the seam and into the paper. Space the pins no further than 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.
For the back neckline, stick the pins straight down through the seam connecting the back neckline to its collar. Space the pins 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.

, Use a pencil to lightly trace around the entire outline of the shirt.


Trace along the shoulder, sides, and bottom of the pinned shirt.
After tracing these elements, lift away the shirt and find the holes marking the sleeve seam and neckline seam. Trace along these holes to complete the outline for the back pattern piece.

, Move the folded shirt over to a fresh piece of paper, pinning along the front outline instead of the back.


Follow the same steps used for the shirt back to place the pins along the perimeter and sleeves of the shirt front.
The front neckline is usually deeper than the back. To mark it out, place the pins beneath the front portion of the neckline, just beneath the collar. Keep them 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart and straight down.

, Trace along the front outline just as you traced along the back outline.


Lightly trace the shoulder, sides, and bottom with pencil while the shirt remains pinned in place.
Remove the shirt and trace along the pin marks of the neckline and sleeve to complete the front outline.

, Unfold the shirt. Flatten out one sleeve and pin it to clean paper. Trace around the outline.


As before, insert the pins straight through the connecting seam.
Trace around the top, bottom, and outer edge of the sleeve with the sleeve still in place.
Remove the shirt from the paper and trace along the pin-marked seam to complete the outline.

, Use a flexible ruler and pencil to carefully draw another outline around the current perimeter of each piece. This secondary outline will be the seam allowance.


You can choose a seam allowance amount you feel comfortable with, but as a general rule, using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance should give you plenty of room to work with.

, Label each piece by part (back body, front body, and sleeve). Mark the fold line of each piece, as well.


The fold line of the front and back body pieces will be the straight, folded edge of your original shirt.
The fold line of the sleeve will be the straight top edge of the sleeve.

, Carefully cut around each pattern piece outline. When finished, verify that the pattern pieces match one another.


When you place the open sides of the front and back pieces together, the shoulders and armholes should match up.
When you place the sleeve over the armhole of either main body piece, the actual measurement (not the seam allowance) should also match up.

, Most t-shirts are made with knit fabric, but you may wish to choose a knit fabric with a fairly low amount of stretch to make the sewing process easier.


As a general rule, though, it will be easiest to duplicate the fit of the original shirt you drafted your pattern from if you use a material similar in construction and weight.

, Wash and dry the material as you usually would before you do anything else with it.


By washing the fabric first, you can pre-shrink it and set the dye. As a result, the pattern pieces you cut out and sew together should be more accurately sized.

, Fold the material in half and place your pattern pieces on top. Pin the pattern down, trace around it, and cut around each piece.


Fold the material in half with the right-sides facing in, and keep the fabric as flat as possible when you lay it out.
Match the fold of the fabric to each ""fold"" mark on your pattern pieces.
When pinning the pattern pieces in place, pin straight through both layers of material. Trace around the entire outline with fabric pencil, then cut along the outline without unpinning the pattern.
After cutting out the material, you can unpin and remove the paper pattern pieces.

, Measure the full neckline of your shirt with a flexible ruler or measuring tape. Subtract 4 inches (10 cm) from this measurement, then cut a piece of ribbing to that length.Ribbing is is a type of knit fabric with vertical ribs. You can technically use non-ribbed knits for your collar, but ribbing is generally preferred since it has an even greater amount of elasticity.
Cut the width of the ribbing to double the amount of your final collar width.
The vertical ribs should run parallel to the width of the collar and perpendicular to the length of the collar.

, Fold the ribbing in half lengthwise, then use an iron to press the fold.


Note that the right-sides should be facing as you do this.

, Fold the ribbing in half crosswise. Stitch the width ends of the strip together, using a 1/4-inch (6-mm) seam allowance.


Note that the right-sides should remain facing as you do this.

, Place the front and back body pieces together, right-sides facing inward. Pin around the shoulders only.

, Stitch straight across one shoulder seam. Cut the thread, then stitch straight across the other shoulder seam.


You should be able to use a standard straight stitch on your sewing machine for this.
Follow the seam allowance you marked out on your pattern pieces. If you've been following this tutorial exactly, the seam allowance will be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Open the shirt and lay it flat at the shoulders, right-sides facing down. Place the ribbed collar over the neckline opening and pin it in place.Point the raw side of the collar toward the neckline and keep it above the shirt material. Pin it to the center back of the shirt and the center front.
The collar will be smaller than the neckline opening, so you'll need to gently stretch the collar as you pin it down to the rest of the neckline. Try to keep the ribbing evenly spaced.

, Using a zigzag stitch, sew along the raw edge of the collar, using a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance.


You must use a zigzag stitch instead of a straight stitch; otherwise, the thread won't be able to stretch with the collar as you pull the finished garment over your head.
Use your hands to gently stretch the ribbing as you sew it onto the shirt. Keep it somewhat taut so that no folds form in the connecting fabric.

, Keep the shirt open and flat at the shoulder, but flip it over so that the right-side faces up. Position the sleeves right-side down and pin in place.Position the rounded portion of the sleeve against the rounded portion of the armhole. Pin the middle of both curves together.
Gradually position and pin the rest of the sleeve curve to the rest of the armhole, working on one side at a time.
Repeat this process for both sleeves.

, With the right-sides facing down, sew a straight stitch along both sleeves, connecting them to the armholes in the process.


The seam allowance should match the seam allowance you marked on your original pattern. If you're following this tutorial exactly, the amount should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Fold the shirt with its right-sides facing. Sew a straight stitch down the entire right side of the shirt, working from the tip of the underarm seam straight down to the bottom opening. Repeat on the left side of the shirt when finished.


Pin down the sleeves and sides before stitching them together; otherwise, the material may shift as you work.
Follow the seam allowance you marked on your original pattern. For this tutorial, the seam allowance is 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, With the right-sides still facing, fold the bottom edge up according to your original seam allowance. Pin or press the fold in place, then stitch around the opening.


Make sure that you only stitch the hem in place. Do not sew the front and back sides of the shirt together.
Most knits are fray-resistant, so you may not need to sew a bottom hem. Doing so can create a neater appearance, though.

, With the right-sides facing, fold up the edge of each sleeve opening according to your original seam allowance. Pin or press the fold, then stitch along the opening.


Like the bottom edge, you must stitch around the opening to avoid sewing the front and back together.
You may not need to hem the sleeves if the material is fray-resistant, but they'll look neater if you do.

, Turn the shirt right-side out again. Use an iron to flatten all the seam.


This includes the seams along the collar, shoulders, sleeves, and sides. You may also wish to press the hems, if you did not do so before sewing them in place.

, At this point, the shirt should be finished and ready to wear.

Flexible measuring tape
Elastic fabric band (optional);
, Just about any top can be successfully transformed into a crop top.T-shirts work the best for loose crop tops.
Summer tanks work well for fitted tops.

, Put on the top you will be using. Fold the shirt up and play around with different lengths until you find one you like. Then, add about one inch of extra length to compensate for the hem, and pin it in place., Lay the shirt down on a flat surface. Be sure that the shirt seam lines are even and there are no wrinkles in the fabric. Next, cut the shirt in a straight line or curve the hem. The style of cut is up to you.


You can also cut two longer triangle pieces at the front of the shirt that you can later use to tie together into a knot for a tighter fitting look.

, If you want to change the neckline or sleeves, trace out your cut lines with chalk. First, flip the top inside out, and make chalk lines along the area you want to cut.Be sure to leave an additional inch of length if you choose to hem your cuts.

, Use a sewing machine and hem your top by folding under the bottom about one inch. Be sure to fold the top inward to hide the hem. Do the same for the collar and sleeves.


If you want to leave the shirt without a sewed hem, that is up to you. Just beware, if you decide not to hem the top it could fray over time or after being washed.
If your shirt is made from a stretchy material, make sure to hem using a zig-zag stitch so your shirt will still be able to stretch.

, If you want the top to have a tighter fit around your waist, add elastic to the bottom before you hem the top.Purchase an elastic band from a fabric store that is about 1/2 inch wide.
Sew it along the bottom of your top by laying it flat on the inside of the material towards the bottom. Leave about 3/4 an inch at the bottom that you will fold over the elastic and sew closed.

, After you hem the bottom, your top is finished.


Add rhinestones or other embellishments to make your top even more unique.
If you want to make the top shorter, you can take out the hem with a stitch cutter and do it over.

Flexible measuring tape
Newspaper
Fabric

, It is best to use fabric that has a little bit of stretch such as cotton. However, you can choose whichever type of fabric you want.


You will need about 1/2 yard of fabric.

, In order to cut your fabric to the right size, you need to record your basic measurements in inches. Use a flexible measuring tape, and measure your waist, bust, and back length.


For your waist measurement, measure around the smallest part of your waist and add one inch.
For your bust measurement, measure around the center of your bust and add one inch.
For the length, start from you shoulders. The length will vary depending on how long you want your crop top. Be sure to add two extra inches for hemming or altering., Since you will be measuring around your body, you will need to divide your waist and bust measurement in half to compensate for each piece of fabric. When you cut your fabric, you will have a front and back piece that you will later sew together., Before you cut your fabric, cut the shape you want your crop top to be on the newspaper first. You need to cut the pattern to your unique measurements. Here are the measurements to keep in mind:Shoulder to shoulder
Length of top
Neckline
Bust line
Waist line
Armholes

, This will allow you to check out the cut and fit of your soon-to-be crop top. Each piece should come to the middle of each of your sides underneath your arms and have additional room for the seam.


Leave the length longer than you anticipate the final product being so you can leave room for error.

, Use your newspaper cut out as an outline when cutting out your fabric. Place the newspaper flat onto the fabric, and trace it with a fabric marker or pencil.


Remember to cut out two identical pieces that you will later sew together.

, Lay each piece on top of one another with the ""wrong sides"" facing out. Sew along the edges about a quarter of an inch in.


Don't sew the bottom of your crop top together. Each piece needs to be hemmed individually at the bottom opening.
Finish the bottom hem. To hem the bottom, simply fold in the bottom fabric about 1/2 inch. If you want the crop top to be shorter, cut the additional fabric with scissors and then hem it.

Ski masks come in a number of different lengths. Decide if you want it to stop at the bottom of the chin or if you want it to pool at the bottom of the neck. Measure accordingly.;
, Extend the measurement to the outside of the eyebrows. It is essential that the space between the eyes be wide enough so that the wearer can see., This will be important when you cut the hole for the eyes.,, You will need them later on in the process., Although this amount will make more than 1 homemade balaclava, it will allow you to have some extra fabric in case of mistakes. Choose the thickness of the polar fleece based on the climate; the colder the climate, the thicker the fabric., In order to do this, keep in mind the shape of a balaclava and use the measurements you have recorded. Go to bikewinter.org/balaclava to see an example of a traced balaclava pattern.

This pattern will be traced onto folded fabric, so the pattern should be only for the left hand side of the face. Divide the width measurement and eye measurement in half to get an accurate pattern.
Measure and mark a line on the top of your sheet of paper to indicate the height measurement. Divide the width measurement in half and mark the horizontal width of the balaclava on your pattern.
Measure and mark the length between the top of the head and the top of the eye sockets on the left hand side of your paper. Divide the eye width measurement in half and mark the measurement from the left hand side of your paper. You will cut out a space for the eyes using these measurements.
Trace the pattern according to your marks and the shape in the example pattern. Connect your marks with a domed top for the head, a curve around the back of the skull, an indent for the neck and a space (for the eyes) that indents into the left side of the pattern. Make sure not to indent the area where your mouth and nose will go so that you have room to breathe.

A t-shirt;
, Give yourself plenty of room to work with, and unfold your cardboard. Cut a piece of tracing paper that is a little bigger than the t-shirt you'll be measuring and lay it on the cardboard., Fold your t-shirt in half vertically, with the front half of the t-shirt on the outside. Lay the folded t-shirt on the paper and smooth it out.Use your straight pins to start pinning the seam lines. Keep the pins upright and push them into the cardboard. Use more pins along curved seam lines to get a more accurate measurement., Once you've pinned all the way around the shirt, remove the pins and lift the shirt off the paper. You should be able to see the holes you made., Mark the holes with your pencil so they're easier to see. Use your ruler to start connecting the dots until you've outlined the entire half of the t-shirt.After you've traced the entire shirt, go back through and round out the corners on the neckline and the armhole.When you've finished tracing your pattern, label it. Include the original garment type, the size, and which piece of the pattern it is. In this case, you measured the front of the shirt. Remember to mark the fold line of your pattern. Make a note to cut one on the fold., Fold the t-shirt in half, but this time make sure the back of the shirt is on the outside. Lay it on the tracing paper and pin the seams.Remember to mark the fold line and label this piece of the pattern as the back of the shirt.The neckline, armholes, and hemline on the back of the shirt may be a little different than the front. Try to pin accurately so you have good measurements., Pinning the sleeves is a little different than pinning the front and back of the shirt. Flatten the sleeve on the paper and pin the seams. Keep the sleeve as flat as possible.Follow the same tracing process as you did with the front and back of the shirt. When you label the sleeve piece, make a note that you will need to cut two on the fold., Turn your shirt inside out and match up the shoulders. Pin the four corners of the neckband. Place some pins in the center of the neckband as well.Use your ruler to make the neckband piece a rectangle. The neckband is folded in half, so make sure you double the width on your pattern piece. Subtract about an inch from the length of the pattern to account for the stretch of a neckband. Label the pattern piece accordingly, and make a note to cut one on the fold., Use your ruler and go back through your pattern pieces and add about 1/2"" seam allowance.Measure the hems on the sleeves and shirt bottom and add that amount to the corresponding pattern., Cut each piece out around the outer edge. Leave some space so that you are not cutting along the seam allowance lines. You should have a total of four pieces: one sleeve, one front, one back, and a neckband.Make sure each piece is properly labeled. You can store your pattern in a folder or a large envelope., It's a good idea to wash your fabric before you start sewing. Some fabrics will shrink when they're washed, resulting in a poor fit. Washing beforehand will prevent this.Think about what type of fabric you want to make your t-shirt from. Fabrics fall into two basic categories. There are knit fabrics and woven fabrics. Most shirts use a knit fabric, which is softer than woven fabric.Knit fabrics stretch easier than woven fabrics, making them a little more difficult to work with. However, the added stretch of knit makes for a more breathable garment.Press your fabric after you wash and dry it. You want the fabric to be as smooth as possible before you start working with it. If you're worried about your iron ruining your fabric, do a test press on a small scrap., Give yourself plenty of room to work. Try to work at a table rather than on the floor. You need a hard surface to make sure you get the fabric as smooth as you can. Cutting on a soft surface can also yield inaccurate cuts.


Fold the fabric in half, making sure the selvages are together. Selvages are the woven edges of the fabric.Your fabric will have a ""right side"" and a ""wrong side."" The right side is the front of the fabric. It will be easier to tell the right side of the fabric if it has a pattern on it. When you fold your fabric, keep the right sides facing each other.Keep the fabric as smooth as possible when you lay it out., Take the pieces of your pattern and arrange them on your fabric according to your cutting instructions. Some pattern pieces will say ""cut one on fold,"" or ""cut two on fold."" Line these pieces up along the fold of your fabric., Use straight pins to pin your pattern pieces to your fabric before cutting. Pin the corners of your pattern first, and then pin along the edges.


If you prefer, you can weight the fabric and then use chalk to draw an outline on your fabric.

, Hold the fabric down with one hand, and use your other hand to cut the fabric. Take your time cutting. Use long strokes, and keep the scissors at a 90 degree angle to your cutting surface.

, Take the front and back pieces of your shirt line them up. Make sure the right sides are facing each other, and pin them together at the shoulders. Sew the shoulders together using a straight stitch on your sewing machine. When you're finished sewing the pieces together, iron out the seams., Take the piece of fabric you cut for your neckband and sew the two short ends together using a straight stitch. Your neckband should now be a loop.Fold the neckband piece in half lengthwise with the wrong sides together. Pin the edges and sew them together using a narrow zig-zag stitch., Take your shirt and lay it open. Flatten the shoulders and pin the neckband to the neckline on the right side of the fabric.Pin the neckband at the shoulders first, and then the center and back. Once you've pinned the neckband at these four points, put one more pin between each point.You may have to stretch the neckband to get it to fit in the neckline. This is okay. You want the neckband to be smaller than the neckline so that you have a comfortable fit., Use either a straight stretch stitch or a zig-zag stitch. You want a stitch that will stretch with the fabric.Sew one section at a time, stretching the fabric of the neckband as you go. As you finish a section, remove the pins and make sure the fabric of the shirt is not pleating beneath the neckband.When you finish sewing the neckband, go over it with an iron to press the seams., Lay the shirt out flat and pin the middle of the sleeve curve to the middle of the armhole. Keep the right sides of the fabric together.Pin the sleeve along each side of the armhole. Use a straight stitch to sew the sleeve onto the shirt. Repeat this process with the other sleeve.Once you have attached both sleeves to your shirt, iron the seams., Keep the right sides of the fabric together and pin along the sides of the shirt. Pin the sleeve sides first and work your way down to the hemline.Use a straight stitch to sew the sides of the shirt together. Start at the end of the sleeve and work your way down the side of the shirt.Fold between 1/2"" to 1"" of fabric under the bottom edge of the shirt. Iron this fabric down and use either a straight or zigzag stitch to sew your hem. Press the hem once more when you have finished sewing."

Cut your fabric.,
Fold the long edges of the patterned fabric in by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter), then press them flat with an iron.,
Pin the patterned fabric, right-side-up, on top of the absorbent fabric.,
Sew the long edges of the patterned fabric down, as close to the edge as you can.Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your absorbent fabric.,
Cut a 60-inch (152.4-centimeter) long piece of 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide ribbon.,
Fold the end of the ribbon under by ½-inch (0.27 centimeters), then wrap it around the edges of the burp cloth.,
Topstitch the ribbon down.",How to Make a Burp Cloth1," Pick some absorbent fabric for the body of the burp cloth, such as terry, minky, or flannel. Next, pick some patterned cotton fabric for the center strip. It can be baby or nursery-themed, or just something you find pretty.;
, Avoid using dryer sheets when drying your fabric, as they may make your fabric less-absorbent.


Don't cut your fabric first; it may end up shrinking by quite a bit!

, Cut the absorbent fabric into a 12 by 16-inch (30.48 by 40.64-centimeter) rectangle. Cut the patterned fabric into a 5 by 16-inch (12.7 by 40.64-centimeter) strip. Set the absorbent fabric aside for now.

, Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the long edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters), and secure them with sewing pins. Press the edges flat with an iron, then remove the sewing pins.

, Make sure that the patterned fabric is centered, and that the narrow edges are aligned with the narrow edges of the absorbent fabric. Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric in place.

, Pull the pins put as you go.

, This will longer than you actually need to wrap around the edges of your burp cloth, but it's better to have something be too long than too short. Remember, it is always easier to cut down something that is too long than to add length to something that is too short!


You can also use ½-inch (0.27-centimeter) double-fold bias tape instead.

, Wrap the sides of the ribbon tape over the edges of the burp cloth, so that it looks the same on both sides. Pin the ribbon in place as you go.If you are using bias tape: Open up the bias tape first, then fold the end under by ½ inch (0.27 centimeters). After that, wrap it around the burp cloth, tucking the edges of the cloth into the fold of the bias tape.

, Try to get as close to the inner edge as you can, and remove the pins as you go. To prevent the thread from unraveling, backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing.

One of the most important items in the construction of a bodice is the fit and location of required darts.,
At this point, many patterns will require that if there is a lining, you would repeat the same thing for the lining.,
If a lining is not used but a facing is used for neck and arms, this is where you will be working on those pieces.,
Most blouses call for side seams then sleeves, but sleeves can be fit into armholes prior to sewing side seams.,
Now if this is the end of your blouse, all that is left is the finish work of hem, buttons, hook and eye or whatever is called for.,
If you are attaching your bodice to a lower portion (skirt or pant) of the pattern this is where you will make sure that the waistline is as perfect as you can get it.,
Other than jewels, nothing makes a girl feel prettier than a nice fitting garment.",How to Sew a Bodice," If your pattern requires darts, which are usually used in fitted bodice patterns, (sometimes both front and back) it is essential for the darts to be done accurately. As tedious as ironing open seams can be, it is a total requirement for the bodice, so turn that iron on and have it ready. Darts should be done FIRST. No cheating on using the markers, whether using a roller and colored transfer paper or using tailor pencils or chalk, it is really important to mark the beginning, middle and end of where the dart is located. Remember, one quarter inch can make the difference in whether a bodice fits or not. Use accurate fold and mark. Measure both darts to verify they are the same length. Slow as you go sewing is used for darts, I prefer not to back stitch, but leaving the threads long on the top and bottom of darts. Once sewed and measured (tried on) for accuracy I then tie the ends into a knot and clip. Iron the dart as indicated (usually to the outside.) When the front and back have been connected by shoulder seams, try it on with the bra you plan on wearing with the garment. By doing this it will be evident that the darts are correct, then when you sew the side seams, you will be comfortable with the fit. If you don't like where the darts are fitting, this is where you can make the adjustments, re-do the darts.
, Again, it is SO IMPORTANT that the darts match. Whatever adjustments you made to your garment, you should make to the lining in the same way. When the lining is fit to the main garment, it should become as one with the main material., When working with facings for necklines as well as armholes, it is essential to use the method of basting to ""fit"" the material of the facing to the main bodice. By doing this, it will reduce the puckering that can occur with facings. When ""turning under raw edge"" use the slow sew method unless using a serger to make the raw edge hemmed. Hemming a curved edge when turning under 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) requires making slight folds as you go along to make sure the facing is not puckering or ruffled so that it lays flat on the inside of the bodice. Make sure to iron facing before attaching to main garment. Marking the facings to fit the neckline is as important as making good darts, so don't ignore the circle or triangle markings. Match the facings to the bodice at indicated markings and use a good seam length to insure a tight connection. Iron the seams open first, then iron to the entire facing to the inside of the garment. An old 'trick' was to sew the seam to the facing side to insure the seam stayed down. This can still be done with fabric that holds up to the extra seam. Don't use this with fabrics that can't hold up to the extra seams. (some chiffons, silks and light weave cottons) Facings as well as linings should not be noticeable at all. Again, ""try-on"" the front and back once the shoulders are sewed together to determine just how fitted you want the sides as well as underarms., This procedure is great if you do not have a machine that has removable plate for a small armhole circle. This is easiest for sleeves that have very gathered sleeves at the top. Gather the sleeves using double seam gathering method and pull threads evenly to ensure gathers are fit between markings. Sew the top of the sleeve to the armhole at the top. Finish the bottom of the sleeve first, hem and then starting as the bottom of the sleeve, slowly start sewing up to the armhole then continue with a slight U turn of the machine to sew down the side-seam of the bodice. You can go back and sew the U again to fortify the seam. This particular way of sewing sleeves and side-seams in one continuing motion can save time and help in making a well fit sleeve and underarm. (Really important for comfort.), Hemming is extremely important especially if the blouse is to be worn outside of the lower garment. Make it look finished! If you are making a jersey top and you are using serger for edges, then use that for finishing. If using a fancier pattern and material, then hem it proper!!, This is really the last place you want any puckering, whether in the front or in the back. Take care to make sure that any gathering required of the top of the skirt or pant is done with the same care as the sleeve gathering. Gathers at the waist need to be done very evenly so that it is not bulky!! Make sure to 'try-on' prior to sewing top to bottom to verify the waist is actually on your waistline! (especially if you did NOT fit pattern to your own measurements prior to starting project) You have worked so hard to make sure your Bodice part of the project is perfect, so take the time to make sure the attachment to the bottom is done with the same care. Follow instructions to finish your project., If you are comfortable, confident and you feel pretty, you look pretty!"

Get a pre-folded cloth diaper and some patterned, cotton fabric.,
Wash, dry, and iron the diaper and the cotton fabric.,
Cut your patterned fabric 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) wide and 2½-inch (6.35 centimeters) longer than your diaper.,
Fold the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).,
Fold both of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters).,
Pin the fabric strip down the center of your diaper, with 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) hanging off either side.,
Topstitch the fabric strip down, as close to the side edges as you can.,
Turn the diaper over, then fold the ends of the fabric strip over the top and bottom edges.,
Topstitch the hem down, as close to the side edge as you can.",How to Make a Burp Cloth2," Your patterned fabric can be anything you want it to be. It can be baby-themed, or nursery-themed, or simply something that you find pretty.

, This will remove any shrinking and starches. When drying your fabric, avoid using dryer sheets, as they may reduce the absorbency. Lastly, be sure to iron your fabric. This will help stretch it back out as well as remove any wrinkles.

, This will be long enough to wrap over the front of your diaper, with extra space for the hems.

, Take your fabric strip, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press them flat with an iron., With the wrong side of the fabric still facing you, fold both of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters). Press them flat with an iron.

, Turn your diaper so that one of the narrow edges is facing you. Place the fabric strip down on top of it and center it. Make sure that both ends of the fabric strip are hanging over the edges of your diaper by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Once you are happy with the placement, pin the fabric strip in place.Don't worry about folding the ends of your fabric strip down just yet. You will do that later.

, A good way to do this would be to position the edge of your strip so that it aligns with the center of your presser foot, then shifting the needle off to the side, so that it catches onto the fabric. Topstitch first one side, then the other. Remove the pins as you sew.


Use a thread color that matches your patterned fabric, and a bobbin color that matches your diaper.
Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of you sewing, so that the stitching doesn't come undone.

, You will have a hem that is between ½ and 1 inch (1.27 and 2.54 centimeters) thick, depending on the bulk of your diaper. Secure the hem down with sewing pins.

, Be sure to switch out the bobbin thread so that it matches the patterned fabric. Backstitch as the start and end of your sewing, and remove the pins as you go."

Get some pre-folded cloth diapers and patterned, cotton fabric.,
Wash, dry, and iron the diapers and fabric.,
Pin the diaper to the right side of the fabric.,
Sew along the edges of the diaper using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.Leave a 3 to 4-inch (7.62 to 10.16-centimeter) gap along one of the edges so that you can turn the fabric.Remove the sewing pins as you sew.,
Clip the corners, then turn the fabric inside out.,
Press the burp cloth flat with an iron.,
Topstitch around the edge of the burp cloth.,
Topstitch two straight lines down the burp cloth, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) to either side of the of the diaper stitch lines.",How to Make a Burp Cloth3," Choose a pretty color for the fabric. It can be baby or nursery-themed, or something that you find pretty.


If you can't find any pre-folded cloth diapers, you can use another type of absorbent fabric, such as terry cloth, minky fabric, or flannel. Cut it down to 11 by 16 inches (27.94 by 40.64 centimeters)., Do not use dryer sheets; some people find that they reduce the fabrics' absorbency. Once the diapers and cotton fabric is dry, iron them out. They will have shrunk a little in the wash, but the ironing will help length and smooth them out again., If the fabric is much later than the diaper, trim it down until the edges align.

,


If you are making your burp cloth from scratch using you own fabric, use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance instead.Consider using a piece of masking tape to remind you where to leave the gap. Pull the tape off when you are done sewing., Snip the corners as close as you can to the stitching without actually cutting through the thread. This will help reduce the bulk. ref>http://takingcareofmonkeybusiness.com/blog/2015/11/05/diy-burp-cloths/</ref>


Use a chopstick, knitting needle, or some other blunt, pointy tool to help turn and shape the corners.

, Be sure to tuck any excess fabric into the gap first, so that the edges are neat and even. If you need to, keep the edge down with sewing pins.

, Turn the burp cloth so that the diaper cloth side is facing you. Sew all the way around it, as close to the edges as you can. Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling. If you used any sewing pins, be sure to pull them out as you go.


Use a thread color that matches your diaper cloth, typically white.
Use a bobbin color that matches your patterned fabric. You can either match it to the background or to the pattern.

, Most pre-folded cloth diapers will have a set of two lines running down the middle. Topstitch straight down the diaper, ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) to left of the left-hand-side stitch line. Next, topstitch ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter) to the right of the right-hand-side stitch line.Remember to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the thread from coming undone.


If you make your burp cloth using your own fabric, you can skip this step. You can also simply topstitch two vertical lines down the center of your burp cloth, about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) away from the long edges.

Trace a tank top or a t-shirt (with sleeves tucked in so you can get the arm openings) onto pieces of newspaper or a brown paper bag that's been opened up.,
Add about 1/2 inch (about 13 mm) around the entire outline for seam allowance.,
Make the front piece in two halves.,
Make the back piece by laying the t-shirt flat and tracing along it.,
Cut out the pattern pieces and inspect.,
Buy your cloth.,
Cut out the fabric.,
Mark the stitching lines on the wrong side (the side you won't see in the finished product).,
Repeat Steps 1 and 2 for your lining cloth.,
Using a sewing machine, sew side seams right sides together (RST), vest to vest, lining to lining.,
Sew the vest and lining fabrics together RST, leaving the shoulder seams open.,
Turn the fabric inside-out by pulling it through one of the shoulder seams.,
Pin and sew shoulder seams.,
Add a row of topstitch 1/8 inch all the way along the edge (optional).A topstitch is a stitch visible from the fabric's right side.,
Decide on a closure type.,
Add snaps with a snap plier tool.,
Add buttons by making button holes and sewing buttons on the opposite side.",How to Sew a Vest," This simple method ensures the vest will be a good fit without the hassle of measurements, etc.;
, Seam allowance is the part that gets folded under when you make the seams. , For each half, fold the t-shirt in half vertically and trace around it, adding seam allowance along the outer edge plus a little extra room for the front-center overlap if desired (e.g., where you'd put snaps or buttons).

, Again, add room (1/2 inch) for the seam allowance. Keep in mind the back may have a higher neckline than the front pieces, depending on your design.

, Put the cutout pieces together as they would be for the vest, making sure the armholes and hem line up., You'll need at least 1 to 1 1/2 yards for the vest, and an equal amount for the lining.


The lining is the part that goes inside the vest, on the reverse side of the outer cloth.
If you have doubts as to how much fabric you need, take your pattern to the fabric or craft store and ask for help. It's always better to have a bit extra material than not enough.
You can choose from a wide range of materials for your vest. Keep in mind the season when selecting your fabric; for example, you can use a light wool for autumn, velvet for winter, seersucker for spring, and silk or light cotton for summer.

, On a large working surface, lay the fabric out. Place the cutout patterns on top, pinning them together to avoid slippage. Use a pen to trace the outline onto the fabric.

, Remove the pattern pieces and use a pen to mark a dotted line around the fabric about 1/2 inch from the edge (your seam allowance). You'll follow this line when you sew up the vest., When you've finished this, check that the lining pieces line up with the vest pieces.

, At this point, you are not sewing the lining to the vest, but rather working on the two parts separately.Right sides together (RST) means that the insides of your seam – the parts touching each other – are the right sides of the cloth (the part with the pattern and/or the one that will be seen in the finished product), while the wrong sides are showing outside.At this point, it may be helpful to press the seams flat with an iron if your fabric allows.

, Line up the vest and lining pieces, making sure the side seams and shoulder openings match up. Pin them together and sew along all sides except the shoulder seams (the part at the top between the neck and shoulder openings)., At this point, the right side of the fabric should be visible for both liner and vest.

, First fold the top 1/2 inch of the back shoulder piece under, then tuck the front piece in. Place a pin at either end of the shoulder seam and sew together on the back piece, about 1/8 inch from the edge. Repeat for the other shoulder seam.

, While for some vests this may not be desirable, it adds a crisp finish to more tailored pieces. You can make topstitch with your sewing machine.


For a subtle topstitch, use a regular or lightweight thread that is a similar shade as the fabric. For more contrast, choose a heavier thread and/or a contrasting color.
Press the vest before adding topstitch for better accuracy., If you want the option of closing your vest, you'll need to decide how. Buttons and snaps are popular options and easy to add.


Measure where you want your closures to go. You can eyeball the top and bottom closures and then measure and mark precisely where the middle closures should be. Ensure you have the positions marked evenly on both inside edges so that they line up.

, Follow the directions for your particular snap plier. First affix the stub to one side, and next the socket to the other.

,


To make button holes by hand, sew two parallel satin stitches the length of the button and connect them at the top and bottom (these are called bar tacks). Place pins at either end of the hole, just along the bar tacks, and slice open the fabric in between the seams using a seam ripper or small, sharp scissors.
Alternatively, your sewing machine might have an attachment for button holes. Lucky you!Sew buttons onto the opposite side of the button holes.

Decide on a design for your puff sleeve pattern.,
Take measurements.,
Add 1 inch (2.54 cm) to the circumference measurements and 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) to the length measurements to account for the seam allowances and the hem.

,
Make a pattern.,
Lay your pattern out on a double layer of fabric (for 2 puff sleeves) and pin into place.

,
Cut out your pattern, being sure to cut through both layers of fabric.

,
Mark the center point of the sleeve seam (at the top of the bell shape) and mark where on the bell you want your gathering to begin and end.

,
Fold each pattern piece in half, right side in, along the vertical center point line from shoulder to hem.

,
Sew puff sleeves from the armpit seam line to the hem, creating the basic sleeve cylinder.

,
Turn out the sleeves so they are right side out.

,
Baste stitch, by hand, around the perimeter of the bell shape of the puffy sleeve pattern where you want the gathering to be.

,
Gather the basting stitch until it fits inside the sleeve opening of the shirt you will be sewing it into.,
Pin the puff sleeves into the shirt.,
Sew puff sleeves.,
Finish the sleeve hems.",How to Sew Puff Sleeves," Consider the following aspects of pattern design:


Sleeve length
Gathering. You can choose to place gathering at the cap, the hem or both. Additionally, you need to decide how far around the circumference of the cap and the hem you want your gathering to span.
Fullness. A fullness of 1 is a flat sleeve and a fullness of 3 is an extremely voluminous puffy sleeve.;
, You will need to record the following measurements: length of the sleeve from the shoulder to the hem, length of the sleeve from the armpit to the hem, circumference of the sleeve around the lower hem and circumference of the sleeve around the shoulder seam.

,, Lay pattern paper out on a flat surface and draft a pattern for your custom puffy sleeve design.


Take your hem and shoulder seam measurements and multiply them by your chosen fullness. Record these measurements for pattern making.
Use a straight edge to draw a horizontal line the length of your hem measurement (multiplied by the fullness) along the lower edge of the pattern paper.
Measure up from each end of the lower hem line the distance of the lesser sleeve length measurement (armpit to hem) and make marks.
Draw a line parallel to the lower hem connecting the 2 marks above the lower hem line. This is the armpit seam line. Use a drafter's triangle to make sure the center point of the lower hem lines up perfectly with the center point of the armpit seam line.
Draw an upward vertical line the length of the greater sleeve measurement (hem to shoulder), starting at the lower hem line and extending through the armpit seam line. Make a mark at the upper point of your line. That is the center point of your sleeve's puff.
Take the measurement for the circumference of your sleeve at the shoulder seam and multiply it by your fullness. Cut a thread to that length.
Fold the shoulder seam length thread in half to find its center point. Line that point up with the uppermost center point (puff sleeve center point) of your pattern. Use tape or a fabric pin to connect the thread to the pattern paper at their center points.
Form the thread into a bell shape, matching the left end to the corresponding left end of the armpit seam line and vice versa for the right end.
Determine where you want your gathering to be on the sleeve and mark the beginning and ending points on the bell shape. Be sure to start at least 0.5 inch (2.54 cm) in from each armpit seam line end to account for the seam allowance.
Draw vertical lines from the left and right armpit seam line ends to the corresponding hem line ends. You now have your pattern.

,,,,,,,, Finesse the gathering until it is evenly distributed along the bell shape.

,


Turn the shirt inside out and fit the sleeves into the sleeve openings from the inside of the shirt.
Line up the raw edges along the shirt's sleeve openings and the sleeves' shoulder seams, matching the center points of the sleeves to the center points of the shirt shoulders.
Pin the center points together first, then pin the gathers on the bell into place along the shirt sleeve opening, working from the center out, until you've pinned the entire circumference of the sleeve to the entire armhole opening of the shirt.

, Set your sewing machine to a tight stitch and sew the pinned fabric edges together, taking your time and being careful not to disrupt the gathers.

,


Gather the puffy sleeve hems before folding and stitching if you incorporated hem gathers into your design.
Fold the hem twice into the inside of the sleeve 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) to enclose the raw fabric edge.
Stitch the hem into place along the upper edge of the folded part of the hem.

Turn the dress inside out.",How to Sew a Gingham Dress," You will need the length from the top of your shoulders to the top of your knees. You will also need to measure your bust and then length from the top of your shoulder to the bottom of your armpit.
, Gingham designs come in many different fabric types, so do some research online or in fabric stores to find the cotton, knit or other fabric you like.

Short people, below 5 feet (1.5 m) 5 inches (1.65m) will only need 1 yard (0.9m) of fabric. Taller people may want to buy 1.5 yards (1.4m) of fabric. This dress uses a box template so it will fit most waist sizes.
As well as being sold in many different fabrics, gingham is sold in red, pink, blue, black and yellow check. You may even be able to find more unusual colors of gingham check in online stores.

, Keep it folded in half once, the way it comes from the bolt at the fabric store., Cut it in half lengthwise., Lay them on top of each other with the right sides facing., Cut them shorter if they are longer than your shoulder to knee measurement. Account for approximately 1 extra inch (2.5cm) of length for seam allowances., This step is not necessary if you are using jersey gingham. Use a 1/4 inch (0.6cm) seam allowance.,, Use the shoulder to armpit measurement you took earlier. Remove the pins in this section so that you remember not to sew it closed., You will want to sew approximately 7 inches (17.8cm) on each side of the head. Measure 7 inches from the side inwards and remove the pins in the center., Make sure to avoid the sections for your head, arm holes and the bottom of the dress., If it is too long, measure the length of hem you would like to use.

In this case flip the dress inside out again, and pin according to your measurement. Then sew a hem around the bottom of the dress.

Make a quick dress using your favorite skirt.",How to Sew a Dress," You will want a material for your dress that is stretchy. This is absolutely necessary for an infinity dress. Although you can get lots of materials that are stretchy, knits which contain spandex are generally the easiest to use and will look the best if you're sewing as a beginner.


You can technically buy any fabric that you want for the skirt itself but the stretchy material will be absolutely necessary for the straps and waistband.;
, Measure around the smallest part of your waist and then subtract 3"". This will be the measurement for the waist of your dress. The skirt is a circle skirt, so you will need to cut it from a bolt that is at least as wide as your waist is across and then double the length that you want your skirt. This is very doable if making one big circle for a cocktail length dress. However, if you want yours to be longer, you will need to break the circle down into quarters.


Make a circle at the center of your fabric at the size you measured for your waist. Using that same center point, draw the larger circle for the skirt itself. This should leave you with a small circle inside of a big circle. Cut out the center circle so that your waist has somewhere to go.
The space between the waist and the edge of the larger circle is the length that the skirt will be.
You might want to try this on large sheets of paper before doing it on fabric.
If you break the skirt down into quarters, don't forget to leave a seam allowance between the quarters when you cut them, at least at the waist.

, Take the same waist measurement that you used for the skirt and use that to make the waist band. It will need to be cut to that length and then about 14-20"" high.


When it's cut out, you'll want to fold it over so that the wrong sides are touching each other. This should leave you with a strip of doubled up fabric roughly (your waist measurement) x 10"" (or less).

, Take your height and multiply it by 1.5. This is how long the straps will need to be. The width depends on how big of a chest you have (flat chest gets 10"", average 12"", large 14""). Get a single run of fabric that is at least this long. It will work much better if the straps are cut lengthwise than width-wise, since it will reduce rolling.


Since this will be long and continuous, you will be left with a lot of fabric. However, if the bolt you bought was wide enough, you should have enough material left over for two more straps, which you can use to make another dress.
Be warned, cutting the straps is not easy. That length of fabric can be a challenge. Try folding the fabric back and forth, like you were folding a zig zag with paper. Place the pile so that you can pull from the top going towards you and then weight down the extra. Only work with a length you are comfortable with and measure and cut that one section at a time, pulling out more fabric as you need it.

, Line up the straps so that one end of each of them matches up with the edge of the waist. The facing sides of the fabric on the skirt and straps should be touching. Now, here's where things get tricky. You're going to overlap the straps just a bit and angle them like a V, so that they overlap in a little triangle shape (the base of the triangle overlap being at the waist and point down to the hem of the skirt). Pin these pieces together once you've gotten them arranged.


The amount that the overlap should be depends on your body and how it is shaped. Generally, the triangle of overlap should be about 5-7"" long from base to point.
This overlap is what keeps your chest covered. You can have them not overlap but you'll be making a deep-plunge dress and might need to wear something underneath it.

, Now, with your waistband folded over, begin pinning the raw edges to the waist so that the right sides are facing. It's a good idea to put the center of the waistband opposite from the center of the strap overlap. This way the seam of the joined ends of the waistband will be hidden. Once you've lined up all the edges, pin it in place.

, There is one required seam in this dress and this is it. You are going to sew one continuous circle all around the waist. This will join together all three parts of the dress. Easy, right? Start anywhere on the waist circle that works for you, although somewhere around the side should be easiest to hide. Run the machine forward, back a little, and then forward and back again. This is called locking your stitches in place. Now keep going forward all around the circle until you reach the spot where you started. Back stitch again to finish it off.

, If you want to, you can hem the skirt to get a more professional, clean edge. You don't have to however, and certain fabrics should create a finished edge all on their own. Jersey is a good example of this.

, By adding an elastic top to a pillowcase, you can make a quick and easy tube dress. All you need to finish the look is a belt or other waist accessory. This is useful for Halloween costumes or as a way to practice your sewing skills (or just make good use of an old pillowcase).

, An empire waist dress is a dress which is fitted just under the bust. You can make an easy one by adding a skirt you make to a top you already own or buy. This is easy and looks very feminine and lady-like.

, You can use a cute old bedsheet to make a nice dress. This requires only beginner sewing skills. It's a great project if you want to make a quirky dress using your childhood bedsheets (covered in your favorite cartoon character).

, You can make a really simple dress by attaching a top to your favorite skirt. This is a quick sewing project that is great for a beginner. Simply turn your shirt inside out and line up the waist bands (the skirt will be nested inside the shirt).


Keep in mind that it has to be a stretch skirt with no zipper, since you won't be able to use the zipper anymore.

, Measure you leg's circumference at the thickest part and add a little extra to the material. For example, if your circumference is about 40 centimeter (15.7 in), for each warmer you want to cut two pieces of 25x50cm- you want them a bit loose, don't we? Then cut two pieces, 50x50cm each.

, Fold the pieces from the middle and cut. Done? Great! Now, you should have four pieces of 25x50cm. Now cut 10 centimeter (3.9 in) off, resulting in four 25x40cm and 25x10cm pieces.

, Sew the 25x40cm pieces together from the long edges. Be sure to use the zig-zag!

, Sew them together from the narrow edges, creating two 50x10cm loops.

, Fold each of the loops in half along the long sides, seams inwards, forming a tunnel. Sew the loop on the main piece- notice to keep this piece's seam inwards as you sew! Check it twice, so you don't make any mistakes.

, Use a needle to mark the proper size, then sew and cut it like pictured. This way you won't need an elastic band on top- looks way more professional!

, Put the elastic band in with a safety-pinny and sew to proper length.

, Remove all strands. If you want them to be extra fancy (or cover up a mistake, whoopie doopie), add a tag! Few people put tags to their crafts, so this will look extra cool!

, Now go rock that dance class!

The shirt needs to be baggy, not a fitted style. It also needs to be long enough to wear as a dress—at least mid-thigh length. Men's shirts are great for this!;
, Turn the shirt inside out first. This will keep the outside clean. Put the shirt on, and make a mark where your waist is. You can use a pin or a dressmaker's chalk or pen. Take the shirt off when you are done., Spread the shirt on a flat surface. Use a straight edge to draw a line across it from side to side. Use the mark that you made earlier as a guide. Flip the shirt over, and draw another line on the back. This line will be the guideline for the elastic.Use a dressmaker's chalk for dark colored shirts and a dressmaker's pen for light colored shirts.

, Measure around your waist. Cut a piece of ⅜-inch (9.5-millimeter) elastic according to that measurement.Use black elastic for dark-colored shirts and white elastic for light colored shirts. If you can find a matching color elastic, that's even better!

, Fold the shirt's right side seam towards the back so that it lays flat. Pin one end of the elastic over the seam, aligning the raw edges. Make sure that the elastic is level with the line that you drew. Do not pin the rest of the elastic., Clamp the foot and needle down over the shirt and elastic. Give the elastic a tug, stretching it out. Backstitch once, then sew forward using a narrow zigzag stitch. Keep the elastic pulled taut as you sew. The fabric will gather as you sew.Make sure that you are sewing the elastic over the line that you drew.
Make sure that your thread color matches the shirt material.

, When you reach the left side of the shirt, press the seam down against the fabric. Sew right across the seam. Keep the elastic pulled taut.

, Continue sewing across the back of the shirt. When reach the right side seam again, overlap the ends of the elastic by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew back and forth across the two ends a few times.

, Knot the loose threads, then trim them down. Discard any leftover elastic.

, This is not really necessary, but it will give your dress a nicer look. Cut the ribbed collar off first. Next, cut the front part of the collar into a V-neck or scoop-neck. T-shirt material does not fray, but you can bind the raw edges off with bias tape or jersey fabric, if you'd like., Your dress is now ready to wear! For a cutter look, wear a wide belt over it to hide the waist seam.

Cut along the lines that you drew.,
Unfold the shirt and pin the edges.,
Sew the side seams.,
Hem the dress, if desired.,
Consider modifying the collar.,
Turn the dress right side out.",How to Make a T‐Shirt Dress2," The baggy shirt will eventually turn into your dress. Make sure that it is at least mid-thigh or longer, or it will be too short.


Men's large shirts work especially well for this.

, Turn the larger shirt inside out first. Next, fold both shirts in half lengthwise. If you want your new dress to be sleeveless, tuck the sleeves of the fitted shirt inside so that they are out of the way.

, Make sure that both of the long, folded edges are aligned. The shoulders and collars of both shirts should match up., This extra space will be your seam allowance.You want to trace around the sleeves/arm holes and side edges. Stop when you get to the bottom of the fitted shirt. Do not draw across the bottom hem.


Use a dress maker's pen of light colored fabrics and a dress maker's chalk for dark.

, Place a long ruler or straight edge on top of your large shirt. Angle it so that it connects with the bottom corner of the fitted shirt and the bottom corner of the large shirt. Draw along that line, then remove the ruler.

, Take the fitted shirt off first and put it away. Use a pair of fabric scissors to cut along the lines that you drew. Be sure to cut through all four layers of fabric.

, Keep the right sides facing in as you pin along the two side edges. Do not pin along the armholes or sleeve ends.

, Use a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance and a narrow zigzag stitch. If you added sleeves, be sure to sew along the top and bottom edges of the sleeves, but not the openings., T-shirt fabric does not fray, but this will give your dress a more professional finish. Fold the bottom hem up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press it flat with an iron, then sew around it using a narrow zigzag stitch, ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) away from the inside edge.


You can also hem the sleeves or armholes in a similar fashion.

, Most baggy T-shirts have a boring collar. Step things up by cutting the collar off first. Next, trim the front of the collar down into a V-neck or a scoop-neck. Fold the edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and stitch them in place using a zigzag stitch. Alternatively, you can bind them with bias tape or extra ribbed/jersey fabric.

, It is now ready to wear! If the dress flares out too much for your liking, turn it inside out and sew the bottom edges narrower so that they don't angle as much.

Turn the dress inside out.",How to Make a T‐Shirt Dress3," This style of dress has a bodice and a gathered skirt. Choose a fitted T-shirt that fits you well without stretching too much. Next, choose a material for the skirt. You can use matching cotton fabric, jersey fabric, or a large, baggy T-shirt. The colors and patterns can match, or they can be different.


For an interesting look, try a solid-colored shirt with pattered cotton for the skirt.

, Turn your shirt inside out and put it on. Decide where you want the bodice part of the dress to end and the skirt to begin. This is typically just below the bust or right at the waist. Make a mark using a pin or a dress maker's chalk or pen. Pull the shirt off when you are done.


Use chalk for dark colored fabric and pen for light colored fabric.

, If you need to, use a ruler and a dress maker's chalk or pen to draw a line across your shirt. Cut through both layers of fabric ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) below that line. This will be your seam allowance., Use a measuring tape to measure down from where you want the bodice to end and the skirt to begin. Add ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) for the top seam and 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the bottom hem. The skirt part can be as long or as short as you'd like.

, It needs to be the same length you want it to be, plus the additional 1½ inch (3.81 centimeters), and at least four times wider than the width of your shirt. The wider the fabric is, the fuller the skirt will be!

, Fold the skirt material in half with the right sides facing in. It should still be the same length you want it to be. Sew it along the edge using a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance and a straight stitch.


If you are using stretchy fabric for the skirt, use a narrow zigzag stitch instead.

, The first row should be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the top edge, and the second row should be ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters) away from the top edge. You can make a basting stitch by using a long stitch length and a low/loose stitch tension.You will eventually be pulling these threads out, so the color does not matter. In fact, a contrasting color will help you find them later on.

, The bobbin threads will be on the back side of your fabric. Make sure that you are pulling on both threads at the same time. This will keep your gathering more even. Stop pulling when the top of the skirt is the same width as the bottom of your bodice., Turn the shirt right side out. Tuck it into the top of the skirt. Align the bottom/cut edge of the shirt with the gathered top edge of the skirt. The shirt should now be inside the skirt. Make sure that the skirt's seam is centered on the back of the shirt. Pin the two together with sewing pins.

, Use a narrow zigzag stitch, a stretch stitch, or a serged stitch. Sew with a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance., Measure around your chest or torso (wherever it was that you wanted the bodice to end and the skirt to begin). Cut some ⅜-inch (9.5-millimeter) elastic according to that measurement.Use white elastic if your dress is light colored and black elastic if it is dark colored.

, Pin the end of the elastic to the center back of your dress, right into the joining seam. Sew the elastic to the hem using a zigzag stitch, a stretch stitch, or a serged stitch. Pull the elastic taut as you sew. This will gather the dress some more and allow it to stretch when taking it on and off., When you are back to where you started, overlap the elastic by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Sew back and forth across the elastic a few times, then cut off the excess. Knot your thread and trim it down., Remember those threads that you used to gather your skirt? Now is the time to pull them out. Find the ends, and pull on them until the threads come out., Fold the bottom edge of the dress up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), all the way around. Press it with an iron. Fold it up by another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and press it again. Insert some sewing pins, if necessary.

, Sew ⅛ inch (0.32 centimeters) away from the inside edge of the hem. Use a thread color that matches the skirt fabric. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing, and remove any pins as you sew.

, If you'd like, you can embellish it further by adding a sash to the waistband or stitching pretty appliqué to the shoulders of collar.

Cut out your fabric pieces.,
Sew the pieces together.,
Try the dress on.",How to Make a Wrap Dress1," Even the most flattering types of clothes will look better with an exact fit. Use flexible measuring tape to measure the bust, waist, and hips. Use these measurements to accurately pick the correct pattern size to work from., You can buy sewing patterns from fabric stores or download them online. Most pre-printed patterns you can buy will come with multiple sizes on the same sheet. On the other hand, many pattern websites have separate files for use each size. Because wrap dresses are often worn loose and flowy, it's fine if the pattern is slightly larger than your measurements.


Consider what style of wrap dress you would like. The classic wrap dress has long sleeves and stops just above the knee. However, there are variations that include all sleeve types and skirt lengths. You will also need to decide between a real wrap or a faux wrap., The best fabric for a wrap dress is stretchy. Good choices are knit or polyester. You may choose any weight fabric, from light to heavy. It can also be a solid color or patterned.You can also make a wrap dress with non-elastic fabric. However, it will not hug your curves or drape the same way.

, Cut along the black line as guided by your pattern's specific instructions. Use a pair of scissors especially designated for cutting paper. Do not use your fabric scissors, as the patterns will dull them.

, Use straight pins to secure the pattern pieces to your fabric. Mark the pattern using tailor's chalk or some other non-staining writing utensil. Remove the pattern pieces and then cut along these lines.


The typical wrap dress will have about six pieces: two fronts, two sleeves, one back, and one for a tie or belt., This step will be dependent on the specific pattern you've chosen and varies widely. In general, remember to keep all seams at 5/8"" inches. All free edges, such as the bottom of the skirt, should also be hemmed to 5/8"".

, Either wear it yourself or place the dress on an appropriately-sized mannequin. Make sure you like how it looks and check for any areas you may have missed hemming. Re-hem any areas where the hem is uneven or doesn't fit right. If the dress is too loose, try widening the hem in that section. Test run the new seams using straight pins before you actually begin to sew.

Add the waistband.,
Invert the waistband and wear.",How to Make a Wrap Dress2," You will need about three yards of fabric to make this dress. The best fabric types you can pick will be ones that are stretchy and drape well. Polyesters or knits are both good choices.

, Like all clothing, tailoring your dress to exactly what you need will make it look its best. You will need just two measurements before beginning:


Your waist at its smallest part.
The length from your waist to where you want the bottom of the dress to be. This will be its skirt length., Fold your fabric in half once and lay it on a flat surface. If your fabric is rectangular, make the fold along its length. From one of the two parallel free edges, use measuring tape to measure out the skirt length you determined earlier. Make sure the tape is straight and parallel to the long edge, not diagonal. Mark the skirt length on both sides of the fabric using either fabric chalk or straight pins. Cut straight across along these marks using sharp fabric scissors., Take the free long edges of your skirt and sew them together. The result should be a long tube.Many fabrics, especially ones with patterns, have only one side meant to be visible in the final garment. If your fabric is like this, sew the nicer sides together facing each other. You will flip the tube right-side-out later.

, Make a wide and loose stitch about half an inch from what will be the top of your skirt. Sew it completely around the tube. When you're finished, gently tug on one of the thread ends.This will ""gather"" the skirt, creating a slightly ruffled appearance.


Do not trim the edges of the string until the complete dress has been sewn together. If you trim it now, the gather stitch will come undone., On a section of fabric, measure and mark what will be your waistband. This will need to be a strip that is six inches wide and one half to one third of your waist measurement.


If your fabric isn't very stretchy, use your actual waist measurement instead. The more stretchy the fabric, the shorter this piece should be., Make the fold lengthwise. Then, sew the two shorter ends together. Make sure your stitches include all four layers of fabric., You will need two long strips of fabric to create the transformable ""wrap"" part of your dress. The length and width of these strips will be determined by your figure.


The straps' widths should be around 10 inches (25 cm) for a smaller chest, 12 inches (30.5 cm) for an average chest, and 14 inches (35.6 cm) for a large chest. You can make them wider if you would like your dress to have more coverage.
Strap length should correlate with your height. If you are on the short side, make them around 85 inches (216 cm) long. Those of average height should use 95 inches (240 cm) and taller people will need about 105 inches. If you are unsure about how long they should be, add a few inches and trim after assembling your dress if needed., Place the two straps with one short edge flush with the top of your skirt. Position the straps so that they overlap each other slightly by roughly a half inch. Make sure that the unfolded straps lay parallel to the length of the skirt rather than in the opposite direction. Sew the straps to the skirt along the top edge., Pin the waistband around the top of the skirt so that the bottom of the waistband is upside-down and flush with the top of the skirt. Sew the two pieces together.


Position the seam in the front center of the dress so that it will be hidden by the straps when worn.The waistband will be smaller than the top of the skirt. Gently stretch the waistband while sewing to properly line it up and give a snug fit.

, Once you've finished sewing, flip the waistband up and inward. Your dress is now ready to wear.


One style is to wear the dress at the waist with the straps pulled over your chest and around the back of your neck.
You can pair the dress with a similarly-colored tube top for more coverage.

Choose appropriate closures.,
Dress your Barbie in her new outfit!",How to Sew a Barbie Outfit," Follow that link for a basic pattern-purchasing guide. Keep in mind that since Barbie is a licensed brand that pattern manufacturers cannot use, you will need to look for 11 1/2 in. doll clothes or fashion doll clothes.;
, On the back of your pattern envelope, near the top, is a list of suggested fabrics for the Barbie clothes you will make.
Further down, it will also tell you how much fabric you need.For most Barbie garments, 1⁄4 yard (0.2 m). (or meter) is more than enough.

There is also a list of the notions you need on the back of the pattern envelope. Purchase both fabric and notions before beginning your project.

, Find the pattern pieces that correspond to your view, cut them out, and pin them to your fabric (following the straight grain; see pattern layouts in the pattern instructions for more information), and cut. Assemble the cut pieces in stacks, a separate stack for each individual garment. Find the instructions for your outfit. Now you're ready to sew!

, Follow the instructions carefully and make sure that your seams and darts are uniform. Tiny facings can be hard to work with; just take your time and pay close attention to the directions. Press the garment after each step. This will aid greatly in creating professional-looking garments. If you wish to finish the seams, pinking shears or a machine zig-zag stitch work best. Sergers are too large and difficult to control for Barbie clothes.

, Add 1/4"" and 1/8"" wide trims, such as ribbon, rick-rack, lace; try tiny buttons, rhinestones, or whatever you like. To attach rhinestones, use some strong, waterproof fabric glue. Make sure it's a kind that will be ok if you ever need to wash the Barbie outfit.

, 1/4 in. metal snaps usually work best. In most sewing books, you can find a tutorial on how to attach these securely. Velcro is also a viable option, especially if the clothes you are making are for a young child. Iron-on velcro is easiest to attach and it doesn't damage your sewing machine, as regular velcro can.

, Decide what you like and dislike about it and apply what you've learned to your next Barbie outfit. If you're dissatisfied with the result, remember, practice makes perfect, especially when sewing.
Find a sewing mentor who can answer your questions and help you with problems. There are many nice ladies at your local sewing stores (such as Hancock's and Joann's), who are probably more than willing to help out, and many sewing teachers who would love to help you with your sewing projects.

Make the lace holes.",How to Make a Boot," First, you'll need to take measurements of your naked or socked foot (if you plan to wear socks with the boots on). Measure in the unit that's most familiar to you; inches are used in these examples and explanations. You need to decide at this point how tall the boot will be.
*toe to heel
*widest width (ball of foot)
*narrowest width (heel of foot)
*toe to widest point
*toe to top of boot (following the contour of your leg)
*heel to top of boot
*circumference of your calf at widest point (varies with height of boot);
, Trace it onto an old t-shirt or inexpensive fabric.


Use this blank template to get an idea for the shape.
Fill in the measurements and adjust the template as shown in this example for boots set to be about 9.5"" tall.

, Cut out the template and try it on, holding it together using safety pins, to see how the fit will be. Trim it for a more contoured fit if necessary.

, Lay the adjusted template over the final material (e.g. suede) and cut carefully.

, Given that lace holes are an inch apart, multiply the number of lace holes on ONE SIDE of your boot times 10 to determine how much lacing you will need. If you make 10 lace holes each an inch apart, you need 90 to 100 inches (228.6 to 254.0 cm) of lacing to tie your boots. And that's just for the front of one boot! The back should take a bit less, since there's no slope, so let's say 8 holes x 9 = 72"". For two boots, you'll need about 344"" (~29 ft.) of rawhide laces to make these work! Fortunately, rawhide is cheap and comes commonly in 10 meter (~33 ft) spools.


You can cut down on the rawhide consumption by using a straight-up lace and knot (instead of the criss-cross) for the back of the boot, or making your lace holes farther apart.
You may also need more or less depending on how much gap you leave between the side flaps, the height of the boot, etc.
Beware of compromising here though -- laces set further apart mean less stability, looser seams, and gaps in material (through which bugs/dirt may enter) etc.

You can use plain felt from the arts and crafts store, but you'll get a nicer-looking and longer-lasting slipper if you use 5-millimeter thick felt from the fabric store instead.;
, Make sure that you don't trace too far under your arch. To prevent this from happening, look down at your foot while you are tracing it. If you can't see what you are drawing, you are going too far under the arch. Make the lines and curves as neat as you can., Instead of tracing your foot again for the other slipper, simply trace the sole you just cut out onto more felt, and cut that out too. You want to end up with four foot shapes, two for each sole.

, Start tracing from the inside of your arch, all the way around your toes, and finishing at the other side of your foot. Remember to draw over the top of your foot as well.

, If you'd like to save some time, cut two pieces of felt at the same time. This will give you the toe piece for your other slipper., Pin the toe piece to one of the sole pieces first, making sure that the edges meet up; the toe piece will bubbly up a bit. Next, pin the other sole piece on top, sandwiching the toe piece in between., Leave a 2-inch (5.08-centimeter) wide hole at the bottom of the heel so that you can turn the slipper.


To prevent bunching, cut little notches or slits into the toe area of your slipper. Be careful not to cut through the stitching, however.

, If you need to, use a long, thin tool, like a knitting needle, to push out the curves and seams.

, If you'd like to use batting, cut a sole-shape out of polyester quilt batting, and slide it into the sole. If you are using stuffing, simply fill the slipper with it, making it fuller in the arch area.

, You can do this using a sewing machine and a straight stitch for something quick and simple. You can also fold the edges in by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter), and sew them shut with a ladder stitch for a seam-less finish.

Enjoy your new dress.",How to Make a Sundress," Wrap the measuring tape around the fullest part of your bust, keeping it parallel to the ground and taut without squeezing it into your body.

Pinch the tape together at the front of your body and write down the measurement. This is your bust measurement.
Multiply your bust measurement by 1.5, then add a seam allowance of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). This will be the bust measurement you'll need to use for the pattern piece.For example, if you have a bust measurement of 34 inches (86.36 cm), you would need to calculate the following: 34 * 1.5 + 1/2 = 51.5 inches (86.36 * 1.5 + 1.25 = 130.79 cm)

;
, Extend a measuring tape from the top of your bust (just beneath your armpit) down to the point you would like the bottom hem to hit. Stand up straight and keep the tape as straight as possible, too.

Write down the measurement. This will be the final length of the dress.
To calculate how much material you'll need to cut, take this length measurement and add 1-1/2 inches (3.75 cm) for the top seam allowance and 3 inches (7.6 cm) for the bottom hem.

For example, if you want the sundress to be 30 inches (87.55 cm) long, you would need to calculate the following: 30 + 1.5 + 3 = 34.5 inches (76.2 + 3.75 + 7.6 = 87.55 cm)



, Use a measuring stick and fabric pencil to sketch a large rectangle on the wrong side of the fabric. The rectangle should have a width matching your altered bust and a length matching your altered length.

If the material has a pattern on it, make sure that the pattern is upright with respect to the length of the dress.
This tutorial only calls for one rectangle of fabric, but if you want even side seams, you could split the pattern into two separate rectangles. To do that, you'll need to add another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to your altered bust measurement, then divide the entire altered bust in half; doing so should give you the necessary width of each rectangle.

, Double-check your measurements, then carefully cut out your rectangle of fabric using fabric scissors, fabric shears, or a rotary cutter.

From this point on, you'll only need to work with your measured rectangle of fabric. You can set aside the remaining material and save it for another project.

, Double fold the top hem and bottom hem according to your calculated seam allowances, then use an iron to press and hold the fold in place.

For the top hem, fold over the edge toward the wrong side of the fabric by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm), then fold it over again by another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
For the bottom hem, fold over the edge toward the wrong side of the fabric by 1 inch (2.5 cm), then fold it over again by another 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Prepare your sewing machine and sew a straight stitch along the entire top hem. Break, then sew another straight stitch along the entire bottom hem.

Stitch along the innermost fold of the pressed hem for both the top and bottom edges.
You could technically save or alter the bottom hem after you add shirring to the dress, but the top hem must be completed beforehand since the shirring will make it too difficult to get a straight top edge.

, Pin it in place, then sew a straight stitch down the entire open length, using a seam allowance of 1/4 inch (6 mm).

If you choose to use two pieces of material instead of one, you'll need to sew along both open length-wise sides.
Since the raw edges will remain visible, you should also consider stitch back over them with an overlock or zigzag stitch. Doing so will help neaten the edge and prevent it from fraying or scratching against your skin.

, Turn the material right-side out. Using a fabric pencil and a straight edge, mark horizontal shirring lines across the top of the fabric, placing the lines 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart.

Place the first shirring line 1/4 inch (6 mm) down from the top hem of the material, but space all consecutive shirring lines 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart.
The exact number of shirring lines will vary depending on the size of your bust. You'll likely need somewhere between 12 to 16 shirring lines, though. Mark out at least 12, then increase the amount later if necessary.

, Wind the bobbin with shirring elastic by hand instead of doing so using the bobbin winder. Keep the elastic firm as you wind it, but do not stretch it or keep it taut.

Note that you may need several bobbins of elastic to complete this dress, so it's a good idea to prepare two or three.
Place the wound bobbin in the bobbin case and pull up the thread. Load the top of the machine with normal thread that matches the color of your dress material.
Increase the stitch length by several notches and loosen the upper thread tension by one or two marks. The exact settings will vary depending on your machine and the material you use, so it's a good idea to test the settings on some of your leftover scrap material before working on the actual dress.

, Sew along each shirring guideline using a standard straight stitch. Start with the top guideline and gradually work down toward the bottom.

Keep the material right-side up so that the elastic ends up on the wrong-side of the dress.
Back stitch at the beginning and end of each row as you usually would.
Hold the material as flat as possible while stitching the shirring lines. The first line of shirring won't cause much bunching, but with each consecutive row, the fabric will gather up more.
Don't worry too much if your rows aren't perfect since small mistakes will be masked by the shirring. As long as the rows are mostly parallel and the material doesn't double up, the end result will likely be fine.

, After working approximately 12 rows of shirring, try the dress on and evaluate the way it fits.

You may need to add a few more rows of shirring. Try to gauge the point from which you'd like the dress to flare out, then add more lines of shirring to reach that point, spacing each additional line 3/8 inch (9.5 mm) apart.

, Heat up a steam iron and lightly steam the elastic thread along the wrong-side of the dress without pressing it. As the steam flows, the thread should shrink and the material should look neater.

Alternatively, give the right-side of the material a light press with a steam iron to accomplish the same result. Do not allow the hot iron to come into direct contact with the elastic, though.

, Try the dress on and stand in front of a mirror. Using a measuring tape, measure the distance between the front top and back top of the dress over your shoulder.

This measurement is easier to find if someone else takes it. If you need to take the measurement yourself, err on the side of excess to prevent yourself from accidentally cutting the straps too short.

, While you still have the dress on, mark the correct placement of your straps along the front and back using safety pins.

If you're wearing a bra while doing this, the start and end point of your bra straps will usually be a good guideline.
Note that this is another step that will be easier to complete with the help of someone else.

, Cut two lengths of extra-wide double-fold bias tape. Each length should match the necessary strap length, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm).

Since bias tape is thick and neatly pressed, it's a convenient choice to use when adding straps to the dress.For daintier straps, consider using ribbon instead of bias tape. Since the shirring should keep the dress snug against your body without the addition of straps, the actual straps won't need to do the work of holding the dress up.
For coordinating straps, use some of your scrap material instead of bias tape. Double fold the material to hide any raw edges and press the folds in place with an iron. Make the straps as thick as desired, usually between 1/2 inch and 2 inches (1.25 cm and 5 cm).

, Load the sewing machine with normal thread (both top and bobbin), then sew a zigzag stitch along the open length of both strap pieces.

Since you do not need to lock any raw edges into place, you could opt for a straight stitch instead of a zigzag stitch if you would prefer the look of a straight stitch.

, Pin both straps to the strap marks of your dress, leaving 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of strap beneath the top edge of the dress. Top-stitch the connecting points to the dress.

Ideally, you should stitch the straps to the top of the dress following the upper hem stitch. Doing so should help mask the stitch marks.
If necessary, neaten the raw edges of the straps using a zigzag stitch.

, Try the dress on again and stand in front of the mirror. Check the placement and length of both straps.

If you need to readjust the placement of your straps or shorten the length, pull out the connecting seams and make the necessary adjustment. Work carefully when ripping out the seam to avoid disturbing any of the shirring beneath it.

, At this point, your dress should be complete and ready to wear."

Find a shoe that you'd like the pattern to be made for.,
Use the scotch tape to attach the cloth to the back of the shoe and draw a vertical line indicating where the pattern will end.

,
Do the same to the front.,
Do the same for the bottom of the shoe.,
Decide where you want the buttons to go.,
Trace the pattern directly onto the pattern paper.,
Cut the same cloth in half and trace the two pieces onto another section of tracing/pattern paper.,
Add this half-inch to the pattern paper where the original pattern was traced.

,
Add an inch and a half to the original pattern to create leeway where the button seam is.

,
The pattern is ready to be cut out after one final adjustment.,
Cut the pattern along the outlines and include the seam allowance.

,
Fold the pattern along the button and button hole line.

,
Cut off the excess along the bottom of the seam allowance.

,
The leather is ready to be traced and cut out based on the patterns.,
Cut the leather using your scissors.,
All three pieces should now be sewn together.

,
Take the front seam and back seam (both of which are curved) and make small cuts to make the seam lie flat.,
Rub some of the rubber cement onto the corner of the index card.,
Wait until both sides of the seam are sticky and semi-dry then push the sides down using your fingers in the middle of the seam so that it lies flat.

,
Use a small roller to press the seams down and make sure that the bond is especially strong (optional).

,
Rub some of the rubber cement along the edges of the spat and then fold it on itself to create a reinforced area for the buttons.

,
Fold the seam onto itself one inch.,
Find the center of the seam and make a mark with the pen.,
Make a button hole.,
After making the button holes, poke through the holes with a pen to mark the spot that the button will be attached to.,
Attach the buckle as the last step, or a piece of elastic if you'd like.",How to Make Spats," Drape the cloth pattern over the shoe and use the binding clip to attach it to the top of the shoe. The cloth pattern used should be slightly longer and slightly taller than the shoe.;
,, The seam should run down the middle of the laces. Cut off any excess fabric outside the line, and tape the cloth pattern to the shoe. Run your hands along the fabric to take any bumps out of the pattern and ensure the cloth is tight enough to create a good cover.


Decide how low you want to top of the spat to go from the top of the shoe. In this model, the top of the spat will hang slightly lower than the top of the shoe.

, Remember that the pattern should follow the organic shape of the shoe.

, Draw another line indicating this.


Because the lines drawn on the pattern will likely be shaky and not visible in certain areas, go back through and darken the lines to strengthen the pattern outline.

, Cut off the excess cloth and draw the pattern on the paper. Weights can be helpful in keeping the pattern completely still to ensure a steady hand and correctly dimensional pattern.

, This will create the other side of the spat.


On the parts of the boot where the two segments of leather are sewn together (front and back), a half-inch seam allowance is necessary to create leeway.

,,, The triangle represents the excess seam allowance.

,,,, You should have three pieces of the patterns now. Weigh the patterns down on the leather and trace them with a ball-point pen. Because you're creating two different spats for two different feet, make sure you flip the pattern before tracing the pattern for the opposite foot.

, You should have three different pieces prepared to sew together. Use a 2.5 to 4 stitch length on your sewing machine.


Do not use pins when sewing, because pins create permanent holes in the leather. Instead, just hold the pieces together and feed it through. Sew The back-seam the same way the front-seam was sewn, with a half-inch seam allowance.

,, This way, when the spat is folded over it looks nice from the front side.

, Make a thin layer of rubber cement on both sides of the seam.

,,,, Use the roller to press it down and ensure a strong bond. Basic construction is finished and now the buttons are ready to be attached.

, Make two additional marks, one to the left of the center and one to the right, about a quarter of an inch from the edge.

, To make a button hole, a simple one can be made with an Xactoknife, or, for a sturdier one, the button hole attachment on the sewing machine can be used. If you use the machine, you'll want to cut them open with a seam ripper.

, Then sew the buttons on via machine or by hand if you'd prefer.

, Button up the spat, put it on the shoe, then use the pen to mark the place on the spat that you'd like the button to go. Sew either loose end of the buckle onto the inside of the bottom of the spat. You're done!

Place your foot down on a piece of paper, and trace around it using a pencil.,
Place a sheet of paper or fabric down on top of your foot, and conform it to the shape of your toes.,
Use a pencil to trace around your toes and over the top of your foot.,
Trace around your patterns with a pen, leaving a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Cut your pattern pieces out, pin them together, and try them on.,
Pin the patterns to your felt and cut out the pieces.,
Stack the two sole pieces one on top of the other.,
Pin the toe piece to the sole pieces.,
Stitch around the slipper using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Dress it up, if desired.",How to Make Felt Slippers2," When you are done, take the paper away, and set it aside. You only need to trace one foot, because you can easily flip the pattern over.

Avoid going too far under your arch. To prevent this from happening, look down at your foot while you are tracing it; if you can't see what you are drawing, you are going too far under your arch.

, Use a thin, flexible piece of paper for this; a cheap fabric, such as muslin, would also work., Start tracing at the arch, and finish tracing on the other side of your foot. This will create the top pattern piece., Your original pattern lines probably look very sketchy, especially for the top pattern piece. This won't give you very nice slippers. Smooth and straighten your paper out, then carefully trace around the lines you drew, leaving behind a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter border). Make the curves as neat as possible.

If you added bumps for your toes, be sure to omit them for the final pattern.

, This is your chance to make any necessary changes. If the pattern is too small, or doesn't fit right, you will need to make another one. If the pattern is too big, cut it down a little bit smaller, and try it again. If the pattern fits just right, you are ready to move on!

Pin the pattern together ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters) from the edge.

, You can use plain felt from the arts and crafts store, but nice, 5-millimeter thick felt will not only last longer, but it will look and feel better too. Remember to reverse the pattern for your other foot. Here's what you need to cut:

Sole: 2 pieces per slipper. They can be the same color or contrasting colors.
Toe: 1 piece per slipper If you used two different colors for the sole, consider matching the toe piece to one of them.

, If you used two different colors, put the contrasting color on top, so that it will stand out against the toe piece., Start by pinning the top-center of all three pieces together. Next, pin the bottom corners of your toe piece down to the inner and outer arch of your sole pieces., You can do this by hand or on the sewing machine. If you are doing it by hand, consider using a heavy-duty thread, or even embroidery thread. You can use a thread color that matches the felt, or even a contrasting color.

If you are using a sewing machine, you can use a basic stitch for something plain and simple, and a zigzag stitch for something fancier.
If you are doing this by hand, you can use a straight stitch for something easy, and a blanket stitch for a nice, rustic touch.

, Your slipper is officially complete. Now, all you have to do is repeat this method for the other one. You can leave your slippers as they are, or embellish them further with small decorations, such as:

Add some simple embroidery to the toe piece using embroidery thread in a contrasting color.
Stitch some designs onto the toe piece using seed beads.
Add a blanket stitch to the raw edge of your toe piece. This will look great if you used a blanket stitch on the rest of your slipper.
Stitch or glue on felt shapes or appliqués.

Trace your baby's foot using a pencil to make the sole.You only need to trace one foot, because you can simply flip the pattern over for the other slipper.,
Neaten your pattern up, and add a ¼-inch (0.-64-centimeter) seam allowance.Go around your pattern again, but this time, add a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) border.,
Measure the circumference of the sole you just drew.,
Measure up from your baby's heel up to his or her ankle, then add ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters).,
Draw a rectangle with rounded edges according to your two measurements.,
Pin your patterns to the felt, then cut them out.,
Pin the rectangle piece to the sole piece.,
Wrap each side of the rectangle around the sole.,
Stitch around the edge of the slipper.,
Cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) piece of elastic, and stitch it to the inside of your slipper.",How to Make Felt Slippers3," If your baby moves around too much, you can use a slipper or shoe that fits him or her well instead., Make sure that the curves are nice and neat, and not ""sketchy."" You can do this with a pen to distinguish it from the original pattern.

It might still be a good idea to do this if you used a slipper to trace the pattern. Remember, it is always easier to cut down something that's too big than the other way around.

, Start at the pinkie area, and wrap over the toes, around the heel, and back towards the pinkie. Next, overlap towards the big toe, and record your number. This extra measurement is important; it will help create that wrapped, crisscross look for your slipper., This will give you the height of your slipper.Again, if your baby moves around too much, use shoe that fits him or her well. Choose a shoe that ends either at the ankle or just below it; do not use a bootie., Start by drawing a long, skinny rectangle based on your circumference and heel-to-ankle measurements. Next, orient the rectangle landscape-fashion, and use the toe part of your sole to sketch out the curves. Make sure that the pinkie part of the sole touches the top, long edge of the rectangle on each side., You will need to cut out each pattern once. Flip one set over for the other slipper, and set it aside for now., Find the center of the rectangle, and pin one of the long edges to the center of the sole's heel. Your rectangle may have an edge that's move curved than the other one. Keep this edge against the edge of the sole., Start by wrapping one of the flaps around the inside of the heel, over the big toe area, and towards the pinkie, pinning it as you go. Next, wrap the other flap around the other side of your slipper, pinning as you go.Remember to reverse the flaps for your other slipper. This way, they both wrap towards each other.

, You can do this using a simple straight stitch, or you can use a blanket stitch for something fancier. Remember to pull the pins out as your sewing., Place the elastic behind the crossed-over flaps. Pin the left side of the elastic to the left flap, and the right side to the right flap. Avoid stretching the elastic if you can. Next, stitch the elastic in place using a some X-shaped stitch. This will allow the slipper to pull open and close."

Every Butterick, Kwik Sew, McCall's, Simplicity and Vogue pattern comes with sewing instructions that most seamstresses can follow. Not all patterns or sewing instructions are created equal. Butterick, Kwik Sew, McCall's and Simplicity tend to have the best step-by step instructions in their packages, while Vogue instructions tend to be geared for the experienced seamstress/tailor.;
, Generally, the sewing itself is not the difficult part of doing a prom dress. The hard part is dealing with the unique characteristics of the special fabrics you are using..


Pay close attention to the fabric recommendations on the pattern envelope. Some fabrics will work much better than others for a particular project and the pattern envelope will state this for you.
Take care with your material. Most prom dress materials (satin, lace, silk, velvet) are dry-clean only and have other special care instructions (cool iron only, etc). Some also have the annoying characteristic of being slippery to handle (need a lot of pins), fibers ""catch"" and pull when sewing (your machine may need a new, sharp, needle), or they fray easily (tape or iron interfacing along all raw edges before assembling the garment). These difficult to manage characteristics are why we like the look and feel of the material, as well as why dresses made from these materials are so expensive and difficult to make!
Purchase the recommended yardage plus half a yard. Patterns usually allow plenty of yardage, but it's always nice to have a little extra ""just in case"" you cut a piece wrong the first time. If you do everything correctly, you can always use the extra fabric to make a matching purse, scarf, or similar item.

, in advance. Check the pattern for a list of needed items. The last thing you need in the middle of a major project is yet another trip to the store.

, If using a dry-clean only fabric, you may omit this step (unless it smells odd, in which case, take it to the dry cleaners before you start to cut it).

,, These come in large sheets of tan tissue, with several pieces printed per sheet. You will need to cut out the ones you will use and put the others away.

,


Pay close attention to the cutting recommendations given in the pattern. Some recommended layouts will specify that the material is to be folded in half lengthwise or perhaps laid out in a single layer. Pay attention or you could end up with less of a dress than you expected!
If you do not have a large table, you can also use your floor (cleaned first!) or a cutting board. Folded cardboard sheet with inch markings on it are available at most sewing centers for around $10-$15 USD.

,,,,, The pattern companies generally have excellent sewing instructions with illustrations for that specific pattern in the envelope and all you need to do is follow the instructions carefully and to the letter to get a decent result.

, These things will probably need to be hand sewn on using thread that is the same color as the dress.

The dress is meant to be loose-fitting, like a sundress or a maxi dress. Because pillowcases only come in certain lengths, this method may not be suitable for dresses for larger children. You might still be able to use this method to make a shirt or blouse for a larger child, however. Here is a list of what you will need.


A pillow case
Single-fold bias tape
Sewing machine
Thread
Scissors
Pins
Ribbon
Safety pin;
, The best pillowcase to use for this is a rectangular pillowcase. Keep in mind that the bigger child is, the longer pillowcase you will need.


Consider getting a pillowcase that already has a pattern along the open part. The open part will become the hem of the dress. Something with ribbon, embroidery, or lace could be really pretty., Place a measuring tape at your child's shoulder. Measure down to where you want the dress to end.Keep in mind the length of your pillowcase; you can make the pillowcase shorter, but you cannot make it longer. If your pillow is too short, you can do one of two things:


You can find a longer pillowcase. King-sized pillowcases tend to be longer.
Add some fabric lace or a ruffle to the open end of the pillowcase.

, Start from the open part of the pillowcase and measure up towards the top seam. Cut horizontally across the pillowcase when you get to the length you want. This cut part will become the top part of the dress.








, You should end up with a long, skinny, rectangle. This will allow you to cut two identical armholes at the same time.








, The top of the J should be aligned with the top of the pillowcase. Be sure to cut through all layers of fabric at the same time. This will make everything even. Here are some measurements to guide you:








For a small child, make the armhole 1 ½ inches wide and 3 inches tall (3.81 centimeters wide and 7.62 centimeters tall).
For a medium child, make the armhole 2 inches wide and 4 inches tall (5.08 centimeters wide and 10.16 centimeters tall).
For a large child, make the armhole 3 inches wide and 6 inches tall (7.62 centimeters wide and 15.24 centimeters tall).

, Open up the fold in the tape, and line up the edge with the edge of the fabric. Make sure that the right sides of the tape and pillowcase are facing each other. Pin everything in place. You will be flipping the seam tape over, into the pillowcase after you sew it down.







, Use the fold in the tape as a guide. Knot the ends of the threads and snip them off. Don't forget to remove the pins.








, Press it with an iron first, then sew it down. Try to sew as close as possible to the edge of the bias tape. Now you will have a clean edge inside the pillowcase.









Use a thread color that matches the pillow. If your pillow has a pattern on it, use a thread color that matches the base of the pillow, instead of the designs.

, Take the front of the pillowcase and fold the top ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) inside. Fold it another ¾ inch (1.91 centimeters). Press the seam with an iron.Repeat the process for the back of the pillow, and pin everything in place.








, Try to sew as close to the bottom edge as possible.








, Slip a safety pin through the end of a ribbon, and use it to guide the ribbon through the front casing. Repeat the process with a second ribbon through the back casing. Take off the safety pin when you are done.

, If you find any, tie them off into a tight knot, then snip off the excess.








, Take the two ribbons on the left side and tie them into a bow above the left shoulder. Repeat the process with the ribbons on the right side. You may have to scrunch the front and back of the dress to get it to fit across your child's chest and back.

Turn the dress inside out.,
Check for any loose threads.",How to Make a Girl's Simple Dress2," This dress combines a pillowcase and a tank top to make a cute, jumper-like dress. The key to making this dress fit properly is to use a tank top that is already somewhat loose on your child. If you use a tank top that must stretch a lot in order to fit your child, the dress may end up too tight; the skirt part won't stretch. Here is a list of what you will need:


Tank top
Pillowcase
Sewing machine
Thread
Scissors
Pins

, The tank top should fit your child well, but still be just a little on the loose side. Keep in mind that the skirt part of the dress will not stretch, so if the tank top is already tight on your child, the dress will end up too small.


Try using a solid-colored tank top and a pillowcase with a pattern on it. This will be the most pleasing to the eye. Patterns on both the tank top and the pillowcase may clash or make the dress appear too busy.
You can also use a fitted t-shirt as well, just make sure that it is not too tight on your child.

, If you need to, you can put the shirt on the child first; it may help you decide where you want the skirt part to begin. You can have the skirt begin a few inches below the arm hole or even at the waist. The choice is up to you. The tank top will become the bodice part of the dress.








, Try to cut through both layers at the same time. This will make it more even. Set the tank top aside.








, You will be sewing the pillowcase onto the tank top to make the skirt, so make sure to include add ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) to the total length.









How much you cut off of the pillowcase will depend on how tall your child is, or how long you want the skirt to be. For a tall child or a long skirt, cut less off. For a small child or a shorter skirt, cut more off.

, The first row should be ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) away from the cut edge. The second row should be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the edge.Do not overlap, knot, or trim the threads. These are basing stitches, and you will be pulling them to gather the skirt later.









Try to use the longest possible stitch on your sewing machine, and a lower tension.
Using two rows of stitches helps make the gathering easier. It will also make things more even.

, Do not turn the tank top inside out. The right sides of both the pillowcase and the tank top should be touching.

, The cut edges of the tank top should be aligned with the cut edges of the pillowcase. The pillowcase will likely be much wider than the tank top. This is normal; you will be gathering the pillowcase later. Just make sure that the side seam of the pillowcase is touching the back of the tank top., Find the ends of the basting stitches you made earlier. Gently tug on the threads and begin gathering the top of the pillowcase. Keep gathering until the pillowcase is the same width as the tank top. Knot the threads and snip off the excess.








, This will help keep everything in place when you go to sew. Keep the pins a few inches apart, and pin all the way around the waist line of the dress. Be sure that the cut edge of the tank top and the pillowcase are matching up, or the skirt will be uneven.

, The tank top will likely stretch a little. Be sure to knot and trim the threads when you are done.








, You can use a serger to finish off the hem. You can also use a zigzag stitch.








, At this point, your child can wear the dress, but you can also topstitch the waist hem down. To do this, pin the waist hem against the tank top. Next, topstitch it down; try to get as close as possible to the seam line.








, When you are done sewing, go over the dress. Make sure that there are no hanging threads. If you find any, knot them tightly, then snip them off as close as possible to the knot.

, Cut as close as you can without cutting the pocket material. The pocket needs to come away completely intact, with both its front and backing sides in place (i.e., still serving as a real pocket).

, Align them squarely and neatly.

,


Denim, no matter how old it is, can be difficult to sew through, although jeans using Tencel® fabric might be softer. Do what you can to make the sewing easier on your fingers (use a thimble!). If you have a sturdy sewing machine, try using that but be careful not to sew the front of the pocket down.

, These make great gifts for birthdays and best friends.

Optionally, dab a little fabric glue on the covered edges.",How to Sew a Single Fold Hem,",,,,

Rip the side and inside seams below the fold line.
Fold at the fold line, adjust the two layers so they are together and like one material and not two materials stacked.
Sew the side and inside seams. The pants legs whether they are tapered, straight or bell bottoms will not fit perfectly after folding, do this to avoid stress marks and to make sewing easier.
Iron at the fold line.

, If appearance or exactness is important to you, you must baste twice., This step is an article in itself. The keys points are:

The thread tension and stitch length - match it the rest of the pants by practicing on some scrap material.
Follow the steps of sewing exactly on the wax pencil line and double basting. You will be sewing two layers, the feed dog will be moving the bottom layer and the tension of the presser foot keeps the upper layer still, bind the two layers together by basting on both sides of the stitch line.
Sew smoothly and evenly by feeding the material exactly the same throughout the sewing process.

,, Save this material for making carriers and small mending tasks. There are so many colors and weaves, it is difficult at best to match two fabrics perfectly. Save the excess fabric, that you cut, from hemming., If you did not use a zig zag and used the regular stitch instead, cover the cut edges with fabric glue."

Find a loose, comfortable tunic.,
Buy strips of fringe to decorate the dress.,
Start sewing the dress.",How to Make a Flapper Dress1," Go to thrift shops or secondhand stores to look for a good, basic dress. If it's not perfect, you can always cut it to the desired length or style. The fringe will cover up any imperfections!


Knee length is best. This allows for flapper dancing. Flappers have to dance!
Try to make the tunic spaghetti-strapped or sleeveless. It can be short sleeved if you prefer, but do not get long sleeves.;
, Make sure to buy enough to wrap all the way around your dress -- not just the front.


Drape and pin your first row of fringe to the top of your dress. Measure the distance between where you want your second row of fringe to start all the way down to where you want the second-to-last row of fringe to end. Take that amount and divide it by how many rows you have left to sew on. This ensures that all the rows will be evenly spaced.

, For the top row, turn the dress inside out. That'll make it a lot easier. It'll also be much, much easier if you use a sewing machine.


Try on your dress. If anything isn't hanging right, go back and adjust. Even though it will take more time, you'll be grateful you did.

Make a headband.,
Add the perfect shoes.,
Add other accessories.",How to Make a Flapper Dress2," Buy a length of sequin. It should be a matching color to your tunic or fringe. Measure it around your head -- because it stretches a little, it's best to make it a bit smaller rather than a bit bigger.


Cut off the desired length and adhere together with E6000 glue.
Pick the desired place on the headband for your embellishment. This could be a flower, feathers, jewels, or whatever suits your fancy. Place some craft glue on your adornment and press firmly into place. You may want to pin it together with clothespins and leave to dry.

, High heeled Mary Janes (with thick heels) are ideal. If you don't have those, anything that wraps around the ankle (so your shoe doesn't come flying off when doing the Charleston) is good.


Stilettos weren't super common back in the day -- they're also not great for dancing in. Only go for stilettos as a last resort and if you're confident you won't trip!

, Though it's certainly not mandatory, a long string of pearls or feather boa is a fun addition to your already playful outfit. Gloves and a long cigarette holder can help put you in the flapper zone, too!


Don't forget your makeup! Depending on the color of your dress, you may be able to pull off bright red lipstick -- don't be shy! You'll be turning heads already, might as well milk it for all it's worth!

Find a pattern for the trousers you'd like to make.,
Choose your trouser fabric at a fabric store.,
Buy 1.5 feet (1/2 m) of washable lining material, and buy a top stitch color that will either camouflage into the trousers or compliment their color.

,
Practice top stitching with extra material before you start.,
Take 6 body measurements either for yourself or the person who will be wearing the trousers, if your pattern requires it.,
Cut out the pattern along the dotted guidelines, then put the pattern pieces together to make sure they match before starting to cut your fabric.,
Place the pattern pieces on top of the underside of the fabric.,
Align the 2 pieces of fabric that will constitute the back of your pants.,
Stitch the trousers where the fabric meets with a simple stitch along the outer edge of the fabric.

,
Use an iron to press the seam to 1 side, then do either a double or single top stitch on the outside seams of the pants.

,
Align the 2 pieces of fabric that will be the front of your pants.,
Align your pants where the zipper fly will be.,
Match your back portion of your pants with the front portion with the underside of the fabric facing out.,
Stitch the outside leg seams with a single stitch.,
Cut some waist band interfacing to the length of your waist measurement.,
Pin the waist band to the trousers.,
Stitch the ends together and trim any excess fabric.,
Try the pants on to see how far they need to be hemmed.,
Attach a button and cut a button hole at the waist band and above the zipper.",How to Make Trousers," There are many variations, based on women's, men's and children's styles, as well as pleats, wide legs, slim legs and waist heights. You can find patterns in fabric stores or online. Make sure you buy the pattern in the size of the person who will be wearing the trousers.;
, You can order fabric online, but it is recommended that you have a chance to see and feel the fabric before you make the trouser pants. Make sure you have at least 10 feet (3 m) of fabric. It is better to have more fabric than find out you have less than you need. Your pattern should give you the exact amount of fabric that you will need to accomplish the project.

,, You want to make sure you are using the right color and that you are able to create the look you want. For denim trousers, you will want to do 2 top stitches to create the double stitched look on most jeans.

, Some patterns are perfectly sized and others require you to measure and adjust before beginning. Once you get the hang of making trousers, you may want to move away from patterns and experiment by following these measurements. You may need to take the following measurements:


The outside leg measurement. Using a fabric measuring tape, stretch it from the start of the waist over outside of the hip to the ankle. Add 2 inches to your measurement to account for the waist band.
The inside leg measurement. Measure the inside of the leg. Stretch your tape from the groin to the ankle.
The hip measurement. Measure the circumference of your hips from the widest point. Decide whether your widest point is around your hips or your buttocks; you want to take the widest measurement so that the pants fit properly. Now, measure with the tape. Divide the measurement in quarters since you will be using 4 different fabric pieces.
The thigh measurement. Measure the circumference at the widest point of your thigh. Divide the measurement in half and add 1 inch (2.54 cm). The thigh area must have more room for comfort and movement.
The ankle measurement. Measure the circumference of your ankle, making sure you can get your feet through that measurement. Divide the number in half. On wide-leg trousers, you will adjust this measurement to be much wider. The pattern should give you instructions on how many inches (cm) to add.
The groin measurement. Measure the distance from the waist band in front (around your navel) to the waist band in back, following the line of your groin. This is sometimes called the ""underside"" measurement. Divide the number in half and then add 2 inches (5 cm) to it. You also want room for movement with this measurement.

, Correcting any cutting mistakes is essential so that the seam lines will match up.

, Cut along the lines of the pattern, leaving 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) space for seams around every part of the pattern pieces. Mark the pattern pieces with a number or letter if you feel you will lose track of which pieces will be sewn together.

, Pin them in place so that they stay flush at all points during the sewing process. Pin every inch (2.5 cm) to ensure they will not move, and place the pin points with the end pointing toward the seam so that you can remove them on the other side as they go through the sewing machine.

,,, Pin them in place. Stitch the trousers where the fabric meets on the outer edge. Use the iron to press the seam and do a single or double top stitch on the outside seams.

, Do a basting stitch around where your zipper will be. This will keep the pants together and you will remove it later. Iron the 2 seams open on either side of your basting stitch.


Place the actual zipper above the fabric that is ironed down so that it won't get in the way of your sewing machine. Line up the edge of the zipper with the temporarily basted seam. Pin the left side of the zipper fabric to the left seam fabric. Sew the left side with your sewing machine, being sure to do a back stitch to secure the zipper.
Fold back the fabric so that the zipper is laying partially on the table and the fabric is on the opposite side. Sew the outer edge of the same side of the zipper.
On the outside of the fabric, pin down the right side of the zipper to the trouser fabric and mark the line in a curve. This will be your fly. Observe the curve of another fly and zipper on a pair of pants you own in order to see how the stitch will curve. Make sure you go wide around the zipper so that you are not sewing over the zipper. Sew in a curved top stitch. Iron it and take out the temporary basting stitch.

, Pin the outside leg seams. Do not pin where the zipper will be located.

, Turn the pants so that the fabric is right side out.

, Cut fabric around the waist band interfacing and make sure there is a 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) seam allowance. Iron on the waist band interface.

, It should extend further on the right side.

, Turn the pants inside out again and fold the waist band over so that it runs along the first few inches of the waist band fabric. Turn the pants right side out again and do a single or double top stitch to secure the waist band.

, Hem the bottoms of the trousers by turning the fabric inside twice, stitching once from the inside and then doing a single or double top stitch.

, Try on and wear your pants.

Find a t-shirt that that you don't mind cutting up, and turn it inside out.,
Cut across the top of your shirt, just below the armpits.,
Fold the cut edge down by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) and secure it with sewing pins.Make sure that you are pinning all the way around the top of the shirt; you should still be able to open the shirt, like a tube.,
Sew along the folded edge, leaving a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) gap in the back.,

, Try to cut through both layers of the shirt at the same time. This way, you will have to do less cutting. When you are done, discard the top part of the shirt, or save it for another project.


If you are having troubles cutting straight, use a ruler or measuring tape as a guideline.

, For a nice, crisp edge, press the folded hem down with a clothing iron.

, Try to sew as close to the cut edge as you can. You will need the space between the stitching and the folded edge for the elastic. Also, make sure that you leave a ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap between where you started and finished sewing, or you won't be able to get the elastic inside.


Try to use a thread color that closely matches your t-shirt.
If your sewing machine has a knit fabric setting, try to use that; it usually looks like a standard straight stitch that's broken up by V shapes.
Remove the pins when you are done. Also, remember to snip off the loose ends of the threads.

, This will help hold your tube top up. Even if your shirt was fitted, an elastic might still be a good idea; fitted shirts can loosen over time.

, Find the ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide gap in your stitching. Push the safety pin through it, and use it to guide the elastic all the way around the top of the shirt. When you reach the gap again, pull the safety pin out. Both ends of the elastic should now be sticking out of the gap.


Be careful not to lose the other end of the elastic inside the shirt hem.

, Overlap the two ends by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then sew them down using the smallest stitch you can. Overlapping the ends of the elastic like this will prevent any unsightly bulges. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap.


Once you have the elastic back through the gap, you can sew the gap shut for a nicer finish.

",How to Make a Tube Top2," Add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) to each measurement. You will need this extra width for the seam allowances., Add 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) to your measurement. You will need this extra length for the hems., The best fabric to use for a tube top is stretchy, jersey type fabric, like the kind used to make t-shirts.

, The top of the rectangle should equal your bust measurement. The bottom of the rectangle should equal your waist measurement. It will likely taper slightly.

, Secure the side edge with sewing pins. Leave the top and bottom edges alone for now. You will hem them later.

, Pull the pins out as you sew so that you don't accidentally prick yourself. When you are done, tie the threads off into tight knots, and snip them as close to the fabric as you can.

, Flatten the tube top on your ironing board, with the seam facing upward. Spread the seam allowances apart, so that they lay flat against the fabric to either side of the seam. Press them flat with a hot iron.

, Secure the folds with sewing pins, and press them flat with a clothing iron. The wrong sides of the fabric should still be facing outward at this time.

, You will need this gap to slide the elastic through. When sewing the hems, try to sew as close to the raw/cut edge as you can, so that you will have enough space for the elastic. When you are done, pull the sewing pins out. Be sure to tie the ends of the threads off into tight knots and to snip them off, as close to the fabric as you can.


Try to use a stitch intended for sewing stretchy fabrics. It usually looks like a straight stitch, but is broken up by V-shapes.

, This piece of elastic will help keep the tube top up, so make sure it is sturdy.

, Find that ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) wide gap in the top hem. Push the safety pin into the gap, then use it to feed the elastic through the hem. When you reach the gap again, unclip the safety pin. When you are done, you should have both ends of the elastic sticking out from the gap.

, Use the smallest stitch you can, and be careful not to sew them to the fabric. When you are done, push the elastic back through the gap.


At this point, you can sew the gap shut for a neater finish.

, They should be cut a bit like fringe. Make sure you cut both sides of the shirt and that you cut evenly. Each piece should be about a half inch wide and about three inches long. These sizes usually work for everyone, but if its too tight or too loose you may need to adjust. Cut the entire sides starting below the shoulder hem (Where the sleeve ends) and going to the bottom hem.

, Start at the top and be careful not to miss any of them as you tie. If you want you can leave a few untied for a more edgy look, that usually works best in the middle of the sides or at the top or bottom. In other words, try not to just randomly leave some untied, pick your style and stick with it.

Try it on.",How to Make a Tank Top," Check your closet for an existing tank top that fits well. You can draft your pattern using this tank top as a guide.


Keep it simple. Since you're making a basic tank top, you'll need to draft the pattern from another basic tank. Avoid using tank tops that have darts, pleats, draping folds, or other accents.
Drafting this pattern will be easier if you work from a woven tank top, but you can use a stretchy knit if necessary.;
, Fold the tank top in half along its vertical center. Place it on top of brown drafting paper, blank newsprint, or another large sheet of paper.


Fold the tank top in half along its back so that the front neckline remains visible. It won't matter much while you're making the back pattern piece, but it matters when you draft the front pattern piece.

, Trace around the entire outline of the tank top. Then, draw a second outline around the first, positioning it 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to the outside.This extra 1/2 inch will become your seam allowance.
If you're drafting the pattern from a knit tank but wish to make a woven version, add another 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the perimeter and to the inside of the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

This is not necessary if you are drafting the pattern to make another knit tank or if you choose to draft from a woven tank.



, Move the folded tank to another section of paper. Carefully fold the back neckline between the straps, then trace around the outline again, adding another 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


In most cases, the back neckline is higher than the front neckline, which is why you'll need two separate pieces. Folding the back neckline into the shirt should make the front neckline visible, thereby allowing you to trace around it.
Make sure that the rest of the perimeter remains even after you fold in the neckline. If folding the neckline distorts the rest of the tank outline, unfold it again while tracing around the remainder of the outline.

, Use scissors to carefully cut out both pattern pieces (including the seam allowances). Label the pieces ""Back"" and ""Front"" respectively.


It may also be a good idea to mark where the fold sits on each pattern piece.

, To draft a pattern from scratch, you'll need to know the size of your bust/chest measurement, armhole depth, neck depth, and neck width. You'll also need to know your desired length.


To measure your bust/chest, wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your bust (women) or chest (men). Keep the tape taut and parallel to the ground. If you'd prefer a slightly loose tank top, add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to this measurement; otherwise, use the measurement exactly as it is.
To measure your armhole depth, draw the measuring tape from the top outside edge of the shoulder down to the center of the armpit.To measure your neck depth, place the measuring tape at the collarbone, directly where the shoulder and neck seams meet on your shirt. Measure down at an angle to the middle of your bust line or chest line.To measure your neck width, wrap the measuring tape around your entire neck, keeping it parallel to the ground without making it too tight. Divide this measurement in half.
To measure your desired length, measure from the top of your shoulder down to the waistband of your pants or whichever spot you'd like the tank to reach. Keep your back as straight as possible while taking this measurement.

, Draw a rectangle with a height matching your desired length and a width matching half your bust/chest size. You'll draft the front pattern piece within this rectangle.


To create the neck opening:

Start at the top left corner and measure down to the length of your neck depth. Mark this point.
Start at the top left corner and measure across to a point equal to half of your neck width, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm). Mark this point.
Draw a curved line along between these two points. This line will be your neckline; erase or disregard the portion of rectangle lying to the upper left of this new line.


To create the armhole:

Start at the upper end of the neckline and measure 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) along the top, depending on how wide you want the straps to be. Mark this point.
Start in the upper right corner of the rectangle and measure down to a point matching your armhole depth. Mark this point.
Draw a curved line between these two points. This will be your armhole; erase or disregard the portion of rectangle lying to the upper right of this new line.


After completing the outline of the tank, draw a second outline around the first, placing it 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to the outside. This will be your seam allowance.

, On a clean piece of drafting paper, draw another rectangle with a height matching your desired length and a width matching half your bust/chest size. You'll draft the back pattern piece within this rectangle.


To create the neck opening:

Start at the top left corner and measure down 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) depending on how high you want the back neckline to be. (Note that the back neckline is usually higher than the front neckline.) Mark this point.
Start at the top left corner and measure across to a point equal to half your neck width, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm). Mark this point.
Draw a curved line between both of these points. This line will be the neckline for your back pattern piece; erase or disregard the remaining portion of rectangle lying to the upper left of the new line.


Create the armhole measurement by following the same procedure used for the front pattern piece.
Sketch a seam allowance of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) around the finished outline.

, Use scissors to cut out both pattern pieces along the outside perimeter of your seam allowances. Label the pieces ""Front"" and ""Back"" accordingly.


You should also mark the fold line of both pieces. This line lies to the left side of the pattern, beneath the neckline and on the side opposite the armhole.

, Fold your fabric in half. Place both pattern pieces onto the same side of the fabric and pin them in place.


When placing your pattern pieces, line up the sides marked ""fold"" with the actual fold of your fabric.
Try to keep the pattern pieces and fabric as flat as possible when pinning them in place.
Use a fabric pencil or piece of chalk to trace the outline of both pattern pieces onto the fabric. Do not unpin the fabric yet, however.

, Use pinking shears to cut along the traced pattern lines. After cutting out both pieces, unpin and unfold them.Set aside the pattern pieces. If they're still in good shape, you can reuse them later.
If you don't have pinking shears, use a rotary cutter or standard scissors to cut out the material. Pinking shears will minimize potential fraying, but they aren't strictly necessary.

, Fold the bottom hem up 1/4 inch (0.6 cm), then fold over it again by another 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) so that the raw edge gets trapped inside the second fold. Pin and iron press the fold in place.


Repeat this procedure for the armhole openings and neckline, as well.
For the sides and shoulder edges, fold the edge in by 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) but do not perform the double fold. Pin and press these folds into place.
Repeat this procedure for both halves of the tank top.

, Lay the front piece face-up, then place the back piece face-down on top of it. Evenly align both perimeters and pin the two pieces together.


Note that the ""right"" sides must face each other and the ""wrong"" sides should face outward.
Make sure that both pieces are flat and that the edges match all the way around, excluding the necklines.
Pin the shoulders and sides in place. The remaining edges do not need to be pinned.

, Machine stitch along the upper part of the shoulder straps and along both side edges, using a seam allowance no greater than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).


This step creates seams at the shoulders and sides. You do not need seams anywhere else on the garment.
Use a zigzag stitch instead of a straight stitch. The zigzag stitch gives the material more stretch while also helping to minimize potential fraying.

, Machine stitch along the open bottom, neckline, and armholes. Use a seam allowance no greater than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).


Sew around the entire opening; do not stitch the front and back pieces together during this step.
Sew the hems using a standard straight stitch instead of the zigzag stitch.

, Your tank top should be complete. Try it on, wear it out, and show it off.

, Use a loose fitting t-shirt to create the pattern. Do not use a tight-fitting shirt, or else you may not be able to get your t-tunic on. Fold the t-shirt in half lengthwise, and lay it on the corner of the fabric so that the fold in the shirt is right up against the fold in the fabric. The top of the shirt should be up against the side of the fabric with two folds.

, You probably don't want your t-tunic to be shaped like the t-shirt. Using the t-shirt as a guide, design the look you want your tunic to have. You can make the neck bigger, the sleeves longer, the sides wider. Most t-tunics are knee-length, but you can make yours shorter or even stretch all the way to your feet. It's common to have the sleeves and bottom flair out a bit. Don't make your design smaller than the t-shirt in any place It will be hard or impossible to get on. Trace on your design with a pencil.

,, The extra fabric will be used to make the seam. Don't cut the side or top, where the folds are. When you are done, unpin and unfold the first fold. You should have a single shirt-shaped piece of fabric, folded at the shoulders.

, Be careful not to accidentally sew the arm or neck holes. Make sure you are sewing it inside out if your fabric has a front and back, otherwise your seams will show. To keep the fabric from fraying, sew a hem along the other sections, or at least a simple seam.

, Congratulations, it's now complete.

Grab a blanket or square-shaped piece of fabric of suitable size.,
Fold the fabric in half.,
Cut a hole for your head.,
Optionally, hem the seams around the head hole to prevent fraying and curling.,
Optionally, add flair!",How to Make a Poncho1," Ponchos can be nearly any size - they can range from waist-length or higher to floor-length. However, most ponchos should hang down to about wrist-level when your hands are at your sides (and slightly lower on the front and back of your body). To determine if a given piece of fabric is the right size for use as a poncho, drape the blanket or fabric over your head - it will hang about a head-length above where it will as a finished poncho.


Most adults will need a piece of fabric about the dimensions of a normal couch throw, while children will obviously need smaller pieces of fabric. Err on the side of using too much fabric, rather than too little. It's easier to trim a poncho to make it shorter than to sew extra fabric on to make it longer.;
, Next, fold your fabric in half so that the edges meet. Lay your folded fabric flat on a table or a clean, open spot on the floor.









If you'd like an asymmetrical poncho - one that hangs extra-long in the front or back - don't fold your fabric so that its edges meet, but, rather, so that the bottom half is longer than the top half.

, Carefully use a pair of scissors or a fabric knife to cut a slit along the folded edge of the fabric. The slit should be centered along the folded edge - you will probably want to use a tape measure to find the exact center of the fabric's length before cutting to ensure the poncho sits evenly on your shoulders. The hole you make may be the size of your choosing - it just has to be big enough for your head to fit through. Generally, about 12 inches (6 inches on either side of the folded edge's center) is large enough.









Head holes on ponchos don't have to be boring slits. To make a differently-shaped head hole, cut a shape into your folded fabric centered at the midpoint of the folded edge. For example, to make a circular head hole, cut a half-circle centered at the middle of the folded edge, to make a diamond, cut a triangle centered at the middle of the folded edge, etc.
This is the only part of the process in which it's possible to make a serious mistake - defects in your head hole may be visible on the finished poncho. Still, don't worry - as long your hole is big enough to fit your head through and small enough not to let your shoulders through, your poncho will stay on!

, At this point, your poncho is essentially ""done"" - it can be worn and will work as intended. However, if you have the time (and care to do so), you may want to spend a little extra effort making your poncho more durable. The ""rough"", unprotected edge created by cutting your head hole is vulnerable to wear and tear - over time, you may notice it begin to fray. To prevent this, sew a hem around the edge of the head hole to strengthen the material and extend your new garment's life.








, When it comes to making your poncho more functional or eye-catching, you have a variety of options! Just a few are listed below:.


Add pockets. Sew small, flat pieces of fabric to the front or sides of your poncho, leaving the top edge open so that you can stick your hands in. These pieces of fabric can be any shape you like - try squares, half-circles, and hearts!
Add a pattern to the edges. Try cutting a repeating pattern along the edge of the poncho for a killer ""wild west"" look! You have many choices here - for instance, a simple zig-zag may suit your purposes, or you may want to create a fringe by cutting thin strips into the edges.

"
"
Fold a square-shaped blanket or piece of fabric in half.,
Mark the midpoint of the folded edge.,
Mark two points on the folded edge to determine the length of your poncho.,
Continue marking points to make a half circle.,
Cut a circle along the marks.,
Continue as you would with a normal poncho.",How to Make a Poncho2," For this poncho variant, you won't use all of the fabric, but, rather, a circle-shaped portion in the middle. Because of this, you may want to pick a slightly bigger piece of fabric than you would have for the standard poncho above. To begin, fold this fabric so that its edges meet as you normally would.








, The next few steps can be tricky - your goal is to map out the cuts you'll make to create a circular piece of fabric. First, use a tape measure to find the midpoint of the folded edge. Use a pencil or washable pen to mark this point, which will become the center of your circle.








, Next, determine the desired length of your poncho (remember that, generally, ponchos hang about wrist-low on the sides). Mark two more points on the folded edge - one on either side of the central point. Each should be the distance from your center point that you've chosen for the length of your poncho.









For example, if we wanted to make a 22-inch poncho for our child, we'll mark the two points along the folded edge that are 22 inches (55.9 cm) from the central point - one on either side.

, Next, you'll want to start marking points on the top layer of fabric to mark the edges of a half circle centered on the midpoint of the folded edge. To do this, you may want to measure out the desired length of your poncho (this is the same length as in the previous step) with a tape measure, then keep one end of the tape measure on the central point and mark dots in a half-circle. When you're done, you should have a series of dots making a half-circle on the upper layer of fabric.









Following along with our 22-inch poncho example, we would now mark a series of dots on the upper layer of fabric, all of which are 22 inches (55.9 cm) from the central point. This will create a half-circle with a radius of 22 inches (55.9 cm).

, The hard work is done - now, just connect the dots. Use circles to cut along the series of dots you made. Be sure to cut both pieces of the folded fabric together. When finished, you should have a circular piece of fabric! Discard or recycle the extra material.








, You now have your circular fabric - now, you may proceed as you would with a square poncho. Cut a head hole or slit at the center of the fabric's folded edge, hem the head hole if desired, add decorations or flair, and so on. Congratulations - your circular poncho is ready to wear!

Choose your fabric.,
Wash the fabric.,
Select a pattern.,
Make a faux-pattern.,
Take your measurements.",How to Make a Dress1," Any fabric can be used for a dress, although if it is your first time try working with an easy natural or cotton blend. Look for pretty fabrics that meet your color, pattern, and texture needs. Using silky or heavy fabrics are difficult to sew without a bit of practice. Additionally, choose a fabric that is thick enough that it won’t require two layers or a slip. You will need between 2–3 yards (1.8–2.7 m) of fabric total depending on your size and the length of the dress.


Try using a large oversized t-shirt as the base for your dress. These can be found in thrift stores or even in the back of your own closet.
Get creative with your fabric choice and try using a sheet or curtain as the fabric for your dress. You can thrift for pretty vintage versions of these fabrics if you don’t have any at home you’re willing to cut up.;
, To remove any wrinkles or stains and to preshrink fabric before sewing it is important to wash your fabric. After washing and drying, use an iron to smooth it out and prepare it for sewing.

, Dresses are one of the more complicated projects to start with, and are easiest when made using a dress pattern. Patterns are the specific measurements and shapes the different parts of your dress will need to be cut in. These are available for free or for a small price online or in fabric/craft stores. Choose a pattern that is the style and shape you would like, in the correct size for your body type.

, If you don’t want to use a dress pattern to make your dress, you can create a mock pattern by using a dress you already own. Find a dress you like and that fits you well, and use the outline of this to create your pattern. Your final dress will be in the same style of the dress you used to trace.

, If you are using a dress pattern, follow the guide to take your measurements with a soft tape measure. To create a dress using another dress as the pattern, fold it in half lengthwise. Place it over your fabric (also folded lengthwise) and trace around the outside. You can change the total length of your dress using either a pattern or your own measurements by measuring from your hips to the desired end point, and making this alteration to your fabric."
"
Cut your fabric.,
Begin sewing.,
Sew the neckline.,
Add the hem.,
Finish off your dress.",How to Make a Dress2," Lay your fabric flat (or folded in half, if the pattern directs you to do so) and place your pattern over the top. Follow your traced lines and the guide to cut out your fabric in the matching shapes. If you are using a dress for the pattern use your traced outline of half the dress, drawn after being folded in half and placed along the folded edge. Cut along this line, and unfold the fabric to expose a complete front of your dress.


Add ½ inch of extra fabric around the edges of the dress for seam allowances. Most patterns already have this included in their measurements, but you will need to keep this in mind if you are tracing a dress for your pattern.
If you want to add sleeves to your dress, these will need to be cut as separate pieces from the body of the dress. Cut your dress fabric in a tank-style top and then sew your sleeves on later.
Be sure to cut the fabric for the back of this dress as well at this point, using the same method as you did to cut the front.

, Follow the sewing directions on your pattern. Typically the sides of the dress will be sewn first. Turn your fabric inside-out and fold ¼ of an inch over on either side, using an iron to flatten it out. Then, use a zigzag stitch to sew the front and back together, and a top stitch to attach your newly formed seam to the body of the dress. The top stitch will help the fabric to lay flat along the seam and add a more professional look to your dress.


Follow any specific directions on your pattern for sewing additional sections of your dress.
If your pattern directs you to sew something other than the sides first, do so.

, For a simple neckline, fold over ¼ inch of fabric along the edge and iron it flat. Use a straight stitch along the collar to sew the edges in place and keep them from fraying. You can adjust how deep the neckline plunges by measuring the distance from your waist to the desired area on your bust, and adjusting your fabric accordingly.

, on the bottom of the dress, fold over ¼ of an inch of fabric and iron it down flat. If you have one available, use a serger to secure the ends and keep them from unraveling. Then, use a straight stitch to attach the folded edge to the bottom of the dress, holding it in place. So you won't make a mistake.

, If you want, add a zipper to the side or back of your dress to allow for easier opening/closure. You can also choose to add a lace overlay, ruffles, trim, or beading to your dress for an added touch. It’s your dress, and your opportunity to show your style! Do so as you please.

Turn the dress right-side out.",How to Line a Dress," As a general rule, lining fabrics should be smooth, lightweight, and very flexible.Additionally, if the original dress fabric has any stretch, the lining material must have an equal amount to prevent the fit from becoming warped.
Popular lining options include smooth-surfaced cotton blends such as Viole, Habutae, crepe, thin satins, and Georgette. Do not use Negative Weight fabrics, heavy fabrics, or taffeta, crinoline, or tulle as a lining. Negative weight fabrics will alter the form, heavy fabrics will restrict movement, add bulk and weight, taffeta will add unnecessary shape and bulk, and crinoline is harsh on skin, as well as tulle.
Consider the color, too. If the dress fabric is sheer, the lining should match either your skin tone or the color of the dress. If the fabric is opaque, you can coordinate the color of the lining material as desired since it won't show through.;
, The amount of material you'll need for the lining should roughly match the amount of material needed to make the original dress.


Only calculate the amount of necessary material based on the pattern pieces that will come into direct contact with your body: bodice, skirt, and sleeves. You do not need to include any facings, collars, cuffs, or waistbands.
If you're working without a pattern, you'll need to measure the dimensions of the bodice, skirt, and sleeves to determine the required amount of lining fabric.

, Trace the lining from the original pattern used to construct the main dress, but adjust the edges as needed to prevent the lining from hanging beyond the sides of the dress.Only trace the lining for the bodice, skirt, and sleeves (when applicable). Transfer any pattern markings, but do not include extra material for kick pleats. Do not trace lining for the facings, collars, cuffs, or waistbands.
Since the lining must be slightly smaller than the dress, remove 1/8 inch (3 mm) from your lining seam allowance around all of the outer edges, minus any edges that will overlap. In other words, the bottom of the bodice and waistband of the skirt should retain their original seam allowances. Adjust the bottom hem of the skirt to be 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 cm to 2.5 cm) shorter than the main dress.
When working without a pattern, trace the lining from the actual bodice, skirt, and sleeves (when applicable), creating separate pieces of lining for each separately attached portion of the dress. Add 1/8 inch (3 mm) seam allowance to the neckline, shoulders, zipper opening, and armholes (sleeveless dress only). Add 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance to the sides. Do not add any seam allowance to the skirt hem.

, After tracing the lining pieces onto the material, use sewing shears or scissors to carefully cut out each one.


Before beginning, it's a a good idea to check the lining against the original dress. All pieces should match the form of the dress at all points, but the seam allowance and lower hem should be visibly shorter. If any of the lining pieces do not match, you'll need to redo them.

, Before lining the dress, you should follow the original pattern instructions to complete everything except for the outer edges.


Leave the edges at the neck and shoulders raw, but finish the bottom hem. For sleeveless dresses, leave the armhole raw, too.

, Follow the pattern instructions to stitch together the pieces of the lining as though making a separate dress.


Any edge left unfinished on the original dress (neck, shoulders, and armhole) should remain raw on the lining, as well.
Leave the zipper opening unfinished, too. If the dress has any kick pleat or slit, you should also leave those edges unfinished.

, Fold the raw edges of the lining under by 1/8 inch (3 mm) and press them in place using an iron.


Do not fold the neck and shoulder edge under. If the armholes were left raw, do not press them, either.
Press the seam allowance for the zipper opening, along with the seam allowance for any kick pleats or skirt slits.
Press any darts in the lining in the opposite direction of the darts in the dress to reduce the amount of bulk.

, Arrange the lining pieces over the main dress. The right sides should face each other and the wrong sides should face out.


Verify that all key components line up correctly before pinning the lining in place. The lining waistband should match the dress waistband. The zipper opening of the lining should match the zipper opening of the dress, and you should pin the lining in place around that zipper.

, Machine sew the lining to the main dress at the neckline and shoulders using a standard straight stitch.Follow the seam allowance indicated by the original pattern, but keep in mind that the seam allowance of the lining will be 1/8 inch (3 mm) shorter than that of the main fabric.
After sewing the pieces together, notch the seam allowance and corners to reduce potential bulk.

, Machine stitch the lining to the main dress around each armhole using a straight stitch.


For sleeveless dresses, you'll need to follow the seam allowance according to the instructions of the original pattern.
For dresses with sleeves, stitch the lining to the dress directly over the matched seams. Pull the sleeve lining through the sleeves and let it hang loosely.

, If the dress has separate bodice and skirt pieces, you should stitch the lining to the main fabric around the hemline.


Align the lining and main fabric so that the waist lines match. Stitch directly over the existing seams, stopping 1 inch (2.5 cm) before the zipper opening on either side.

, Change the foot on your sewing machine to a zipper foot, then sew the lining to the dress around the zipper.Start at the top left side and sew straight down. To complete the right side, start at the bottom and sew straight up.
Do not get too close to the bumps of the zipper while stitching the lining in place.
If you do not have a zipper foot, you'll need to sew the zipper to the lining by hand, preferably using a fell stitch.

, If the skirt had a slit, stitch the lining to the main dress around the perimeter of the slit.


On the other hand, if the dress has a kick pleat, finish the lining with a narrow hem around this area and let it hang free.
Note that the bottom hem of the skirt should remain loose. You can also leave the outer edge of the sleeve loose, but if you would prefer secured sleeves, top stitch the outer edges of the sleeve together.

, The lining should now be secure, so you can turn the dress right-side out again. This step completes the process.

, Machine stitch the separate lining pieces together. When finished, you should have a duplicate dress form made from the lining.


Sew the sides together with a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance, but use a seam allowance of 1/8 inch (3 mm) along the shoulders.

, Hem the skirt of the lining with 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) seam allowance. Press and finish all of the other raw edges with 1/8 inch (3 mm) seam allowance.


Finish all other raw edges, including the neckline, zipper opening, armhole, sleeve opening, and any skirt slits.

, Turn the dress inside-out but leave the lining right-side out. Slip the lining form over the dress form, matching the seams and edges precisely.


The only edge that should not match will be the lower hem, since the lining should be shorter than the original dress.
Double-check to verify that the zipper and seams overlap properly before pinning them in place.

, Machine stitch the lining to the dress at the neckline, shoulder seams, armholes, and waist seam.


Use a standard straight stitch for all topstitching. Instead of sewing directly over the existing seams, stitch 1/8 inch (3 mm) to the inside of each seam.
If the dress has a slit in the skirt, topstitch the lining to the dress around the slit opening, as well.
Leave the bottom hem of the skirt loose. Sleeve openings can remain loose, or you may wish to stitch them together, as well.

, Switch to a zipper foot, then machine stitch the lining around the zipper.


Sew from top to bottom on the left side of the zipper and from bottom to top on the right side. Make sure that you do not get too close to the bumps of the zipper while working.
Alternatively, you could hand stitch the lining to the zipper if you do not have a zipper foot. Use a fell stitch or similarly secure stitch.

, The lining should be secure, so you can turn the dress right-side out again. Doing so completes the process.

It would be even better if the dress already has boning in the bodice. This will give it some structure and make it more corset-like.Choose a dress whose back sits at your shoulder blades, or just below them.
You can also sew a formal gown from scratch. Buy a pattern that allows for the gown to zip up the back, preferably something with boning. Make the gown according to the instructions, then click here to continue.;
, Use the seam ripper to open up the seams where the zipper is connected to the dress. Start at the top of the dress, and go down to the waist. If you want your corset to be longer, you can extend it 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) below the waist instead. Gently pull the lining of the dress away from the outer fabric to help loosen up the zipper.


If your dress does not have a lining, then use the seam ripper to cut the stitches holding the zipper to the dress.
Do not take the entire zipper out. Having a few inches/centimeters of zipper in the skirt will help you put the dress on and take it off.

, Tug down on the zipper pull to open the zipper all the way. Use a safety pin to secure the zipper pull to the fabric of the skirt. This will ensure that the zipper head doesn't slide off of the zipper tape in the next step.

Tuck it into the tube, then pull it through to the other end. Once you have the entire tube turned right-side-out, unclip the safety pin and set it aside.

, Each segment needs to be about 1¼ inches (3.2 centimeters) long. You are cutting them a little longer than you need to so that you can sew them into the dress more securely., Open up the left side of your dress, where you took the zipper out. Form the segments into loops, and pin them into the lining part. The bottom strand of the first loop should be overlapping the top strand of the second loop, forming an X inside the lining. Keep going until you reach the bottom of the area you cut out.Don't leave the curved part of the loop sticking out of the dress. It should be resting flush against the edge of the dress.
Repeat this step on the right side. Make sure that the loops line up perfectly.
Cover the raw edges of the loops with a matching ribbon if your dress doesn't have a lining.

, Close the opening where you inserted the loops back up, so that the dress looks like it used to. You should now see some loops sticking out of the side where the zipper used to be. Go over the edge on your sewing machine. #* Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing for extra strength.


Sew down the top 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of each zipper half as well.

, You can thread matching or contrasting ribbon through the tops, starting at the top and finishing at the bottom. Choose ribbon that is the same width as each loop. You can also make your own ribbon, by folding lone strips of fabric in half lengthwise, sewing them, then turning them right-side-out., It's best of the fabric matches the fabric of your dress. If you can't find any, consider using a contrasting color instead. Your dress does not need to have a modesty panel. Whether you choose to include one is entirely up to you!

, Turn your dress so that the back is visible, and flatten it. You will have a large gap between the left and right looped edges. Measure across the top and bottom of the gap, adding 2½ inches (6.35 centimeters) to each measurement. Next, measure from the top of the gap straight down to the bottom, then add 1¼ inches (3.2 centimeters) to the measurement. Draw an upside-down trapezoid based on those measurements.

, Fold your material in half, with the right sides facing in. Pin your template to the material, with the top edge aligned with the fold. Cut the pattern out. You don't need to add seam allowances, because it already includes them., Fold the panel in half with the right sides facing in. Sew along the two side edges using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance., Cut a sheet of heavy interfacing that's ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) smaller than your panel on all sides. Iron it to the lining side of the panel following the instructions on the package., If you need to, use a pencil or a knitting needle to help push out the corners and seams so that they are nice and sharp.

, Fold the bottom raw edges in by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) first, then pin them in place. Press the modesty panel flat using a heat setting on your iron that is suitable for the material you are using. Sew the bottom shut using a ladder stitch, removing the pins as you sew.

, You can also secure the panel with snaps instead so that you can remove it if you prefer a backless dress."

Decide whether you like the look of a regular bustle.,
Attach a tie on the underside of the skirt.,
Sew an eye hook to the end of the train.,
Tuck the back of the skirt up and under your dress.",How to Bustle a Wedding Dress1," With a regular bustle, the end of the train is folded up under the back of the dress. This creates the look of a bubble hem and a fuller back to the skirt.A regular bustle may not even be noticeable to others, as it will just be assumed that your dress has just has no train and a full skirt.


Regular bustles are usually easier to create on a skirt that is full but does not have a ton of tulle underneath, as the tulle would make it more difficult for the dress to fall naturally when it is bustled.;
, The tie should be positioned so that when your bustle is completed, your skirt hem will be just off the floor. You, or your seamstress, can sew this into the seam of the skirt so that it is not visible from the outside.

, The eye hook should be concealed as well as possible. There are many that look like lace or decorative beading, so don't settle for an eye hook that is too obvious.


Remember that the eye hook needs to be sturdy enough to hold up the train of your dress, so if your train is really heavy, be sure to attach a sturdy eye hook.

, You will probably need someone to help you with this. Attach the eye hook to the tie on the underside. This will make your hem bubble and your skirt look fuller. Straighten out your dress, making sure that the back of it is lying as it should.


You may need to have more than one point of attachment to make the bustled hem look natural. If in doubt, hire an experienced seamstress to make this bustle.

1 yard of material for the inner layer, such as satin or fleece
a jacket that fits you well
a pair of scissors
pins
a zipper (long enough for the length of the poncho you want to create)
a sewing machine;
, Fold your fabric pieces in half one at a time. Make sure that the edges are lined up evenly. Then, lay one folded piece on top of the other. Line up the folded edges, but do not worry if the other edges do not line up.If your fabrics are different sizes, then place the smaller piece on top of the larger piece.

, Lay a jacket that fits you well next to the folded edge of your fabric. Use the neckline of this jacket to help you determine how wide to make the opening of your poncho jacket. Cut through the two fabric pieces so that the opening will be the same width as your jacket neckline’s opening.








Make each of the cuts a few inches long.

, Next, start at the end of one of the neckline cuts you made and continue cutting down towards the outer edge of the fabric. The line should slant down and out. Repeat the same cut on the other side of the fabric.







, The next cut you will need to make is along the folded edges of your fabric pieces, which is the area where the neck opening of your jacket will be. Cut along the folds at the neckline, but do not separate the pieces yet.







, To create the bottom of your jacket, fold the fabric pieces in half lengthwise. Then, begin cutting along the bottom of the fabric pieces in a rounded shape.








Continue cutting until you reach the center of the fabric.
Go slowly and try to make the edges as even as possible.
When you are done, you will have four separate pieces of fabric instead of two. These are the pieces that you will use to put your poncho jacket together.

, You will need to layer your fabric pieces to get them ready to sew. First, pull apart the four fabric pieces and set them aside. Pick up one of the wool pieces and place it right side down. Then, pick up one of the satin pieces and place it right side up over top of the wool piece.








Line up the edges of the two pieces so that they are even with each other. Smooth them out as well.
Repeat this with your other piece of satin and wool.

, Your satin piece will need to be a little smaller than your wool piece, so you will need to trim around the edges. Take your scissors and trim about ¼ of an inch off of the outside of the satin piece. Trim all the way around the satin piece.








Keep in mind that satin is slippery. Some people find it easier to work with satin when they lay another material over the top of it, such as paper.Try using a piece of paper to hold the satin in place as you cut. Hold the paper in place with one hand and cut along the edge with the other.
When you are done trimming, reposition the satin fabric so that the edges are about the same distance from the edges of the wool piece.
Trim the edges of your other piece of satin as well.

, Secure the satin fabric into place with some pins. When pinning fabric, insert the pin from the top near the outer edge, push the pin in slightly, and then push the pin back up and through the fabric.Place pins every few inches all the way around the edge of the fabric.








Make sure that all of your pins go through both layers of fabric.
Pin both sets of satin and wool fabric.

, After you have pinned your fabrics together, take the pieces to the sewing machine and sew the satin piece onto the wool piece. Make the stitch about ½” away from the edge of the satin. Stitch all the way around the edge of the satin piece.








Satin can develop tears and pulled threads if the needle on your machine is dull. If it has been a while, replace the needle with a new, sharp one.Remove the pins as you go.
Start sewing the edges of the other satin and wool piece after you finish the first one.

, After you have finished stitching the satin onto the wool fabric, you can hem the edges of your first piece. To hem the edges, fold them over so that the edge of the wool fabric overlaps the stitch you made in the satin fabric. Then, either pin the fabric in place to hold the fold or just sew it right away.








The fold should be about a ½” wide all the way around the edges of the fabric.
If you decide to sew without pinning first, make sure that you check the edges often to see how well they are lining up.
Do not hem the second piece of wool and satin just yet. You will need to place the zipper on this piece before you hem the edges.

, Take your wool and satin piece that you have not yet hemmed and find the center of the neckline. Then, cut a straight line down from the center of the neckline to the bottom edge of the jacket.








You may want to sue a piece of paper again to hold the satin in place.Press down on the paper with one hand and cut through the satin and wool with the other hand.

, Turn one of your pieces over so that the wool fabric is on top. Then place your zipper against the edge so that the front of the zipper is facing the floor and the fabric edge of the zipper is lined up with the edge of the wool. Place pins through the wool and the zipper to hold the fabric in place.








Make sure that the pins go through the satin fabric as well.

, After you have pinned the zipper onto the fabric, you can begin to sew. Use a straight stitch to sew the zipper onto the fabric.








If your machine has a zipper attachment, then you can use this piece to sew on the zipper, but it is not necessary.Repeat for the other side.

, When you have finished sewing the zipper onto both sides, you can hem the edges of this piece. Hem the edges the same way that you did with the first piece, but do not sew across the areas between the zipper.








Make sure that you fold over the fabric at the neckline and bottom of the jacket piece to cover the zipper.

, Line up your two jacket pieces so that the wool sides are facing each other and so that the edges are lined up. Pin the long straight edges together to secure them. Then, begin sewing. Sew a straight stitch about ½” to 1” from the edges of the fabric.








If you have a serger, then you can serge the edges instead.

, After you finish sewing, you will need to trim away some of the excess fabric so that the jacket will be a little more comfortable. Trim about ½” away from the seam.








Do not trim the excess fabric if you used a serger.

, Sleeves are optional for this jacket, but adding sleeves is a nice touch. If you want your jacket to have designated openings for your arms, then you can add some faux sleeves by sewing a few inches up from the bottom edge of the jacket on both sides.








First, decide where you want your sleeves to start and end. Make sure that you leave enough room for the sleeves to be loose, but not so loose that you cannot fit into the jacket.
Try on the jacket as is and pinch the fabric around your arms to determine where an ideal spot for sleeves might be. Then, mark these areas with a couple of pins on each side.
Start sewing near the bottom edge and sew straight up towards the neckline. Make each of the stitches a few inches long.
After you finish the sleeves, your poncho jacket is complete!

Decide whether you like the look of a French bustle.,
Attach a tie on the inside of the skirt, almost all the way up to the waist.,
Attach another tie on the underside of the skirt, this time further down the skirt from the first tie.,
Fasten the two ties together.",How to Bustle a Wedding Dress2," With a French bustle the loop and the button are both located under the skirt. When connected, the finished look will have a puff in the middle of the back of your skirt with the lower half of the skirt lying straight down. This kind of bustle is very visible, creating a layer, or more, on the back of the dress that is full and puffy.

, The position of this tie will depend on where you would like the bustle puff on the back of the skirt of your dress. Just remember that the top of the puffy area will be where you attach the tie.


If you are planning on having multiple points of attachment, for instance if your train is really long or you just like the look of multiple sections of full puffy bustle, then you will need to attach several ties at the top of the inside of your skirt.

, This tie should be high enough to hold the skirt off the ground but far enough away from the first tie that when they are tied together is creates a pleasant puffy area. You may need more than one tie, depending on how long your train is.


When using multiple ties, use different color ribbons to color code which ties go together. This will make the job much easier and will also make the ties easier to see under all the layers of tulle and skirting. If you are afraid that the different colors could show through your fabric, just number the ends so that they correspond with the tie you will attach in the next step., Make sure that they are secure and then fluff the back of your dress until it appears just right. If you have multiple ties, make sure they are connected to the correct corresponding tie.


It will be important to have someone help you with this kind of bustle. Assign someone to help bustle your dress for you on your wedding day. You will normally bustle your skirt between the wedding and reception. Have this designated person attend your dress fittings so they can learn how to properly bustle your dress. Generally, this person is the maid of honor or another member of the bridal party.

Decide whether you like the look of an over bustle.,
Attach an eye hook or button on the outside of your wedding dress.,
Attach the lower tie about halfway down the back of the skirt.,
Connect the hook and eye you have attached.,
Attach more sets of hooks and eyes if desired.",How to Bustle a Wedding Dress3," An over bustle is perhaps the simplest type of bustle. It is created by simply attaching the mid point of your train to a button on the upper part of the back of the skirt of your dress, all on the outside of the dress. This can be done with one point of connection, especially on dresses that are light and do not have a long train, or through multiple points, for a heavier fabric or longer train.This is the best bustle if your train has a lot of details or embroidery, because it will all still be visible once bustled.

, It should be attached high up on the train, near your lower back. A good one will be hidden in seams with creative decoration., Ribbons are not usually used for a over bustle, as they would be very visible. Instead people tend to use hook and eye systems.

, Once connected, the underside of the skirt should be off the floor completely. Straighten out the train, making sure that any details on the tail of the train are arranged pleasingly.

, The skirt may have several bustles to lift the back of the dress to display any decorative work on the train. If that is the case, you must tuck in each of the folds so that with the final tie the dress will be neatly layered.

Check the distance from your waist to your shoulder.
Wrap the tape measure around the widest part of your bust.;
, If the fabric is sheer, then plan to use 2 layers of fabric for your dress. Alternatively, use the sheet and a second lining fabric such as white cotton.

, Choose white or a neutral color that will blend in with the fabric.

,


Use the seam ripper to cut every second or third stitch. Then, use your fingers, not the seam ripper, to pull out the threads.
If you're using a fitted sheet, fold the sheet into quarters and cut off the elastic around the perimeter.

, If the unpicked stitches left large holes in the fabric, then trim the edge off of the bedsheet so that the holes don't look unattractive when you're wearing the dress. Save the fabric and use it to make ties for the dress later.

some stretchy jersey fabric in the print or color of your choice.
a pair of sharp scissors
pins
a sewing machine
elastic material for the waistband;
, Fold your jersey fabric in half so that the edges line up and the print is on the inside. Then, lay your fabric out on a hard, clean surface, such as a hardwood floor or a large table. Make sure that the fabric is laying flat and that there are no bumps or ripples in the fabric.







, Your sweatpants will serve as the pattern for the palazzo pants. Fold your sweatpants in half lengthwise and then lay them on top of your fabric. The inseam should be facing out towards the edge of the jersey fabric a few inches away from the edge of the material.







, Use your scissors to cut along the outer edge of your sweatpants. You should cut the fabric a few inches away from the sweatpants to ensure that they will be large enough. Follow the curve of the waist towards the crotch of the sweatpants. Then, cut downwards along the outer edge of the sweatpants leg.







, Next, trim a long even strip off of the top and bottom of your fabric. This will allow you to customize the length of your pants and the height of the waist. Use your sweatpants as your guide. Trim the fabric so that it is a few inches away from the bottom hem of your pants and a few inches away from the waistband.








Don’t worry if there is a lot of excess fabric at the top of your pants. Later on, you will trim this excess fabric and customize your waistband for the fit you want.

, After you have cut one side, flip your sweatpants over lengthwise so that they inseam is a few inches away from the other edge of your fabric. Then, cut along the waist, crotch, and leg of the sweatpants as you did with the other side.








After you have finished cutting the basic pattern, pick up your sweatpants and set them aside.

, The curve that you created in the fabric will be the waist and hips of your pants. This area should be snug, so you will need to trim it. Trim about an inch off of this area on both sides to bring the waist in.







, Leave your fabric as it is and begin pinning along the curved edges (the waist area). Do not pin along the legs yet, just along the outer edge of the curved area. Place the pins about one inch away from the edge of the fabric and space them out about three inches apart.








When pinning fabric, place ball-head pins so that the points are facing in towards the fabric and the balls are on the outside of the fabric., Begin sewing along the curved edges that you just pinned.Remove the pins right before you sew over them.You can use a regular straight stitch, or use a baste stitch first to secure the edges and then go along the baste stitch with a regular stitch. A baste stitch is a temporary stitch that is easy to remove if you do not like the results.








Make sure that your stitch is about one to two inches from the edge of the fabric to ensure a strong seam.
After you have finished sewing, trim off any excess thread from the areas you just sewed.

, After you have sewed both sides of the pants, pick up your fabric and adjust it so that the two seams that you created are facing each other. Then, lay the fabric out on a flat surface.








The leg fabric should now look more like pant legs with a space between them. This space will be the inseam of your pants.
Keep the fabric’s print facing inwards. Do not turn it inside out.

, Place one pin at the crotch and then go down the inside of one of the pant legs and place pins about three inches apart. Make sure that the pins are about an inch from the edge of the fabric. Pin the other pant leg as well.







, After your pants are pinned, being sewing along the inseam.Take out the pins as you go, right before you sew over them.Remember to sew about an inch or two away from the edge of the fabric. You may want to begin with a baste stitch and then follow it up with a regular stitch, or you can just start with a regular stitch.









After you have finished sewing the inseam, go along the sewn edges and trim off any excess thread.

, To determine where to cut your waistband, turn the pants inside out and try them on. Pull the waistband fabric up and then fold it over. Adjust the fabric to where it feels comfortable. The top of the folded fabric should be close to your belly button.








After you have found a comfortable height for your waistband, remove the pants. Try to keep the waistband folded at the level that you like it. You may even want to place a couple of pins to keep it in place.

, Use your scissors to trim along the bottom edge of the folded material. Do not worry if this is a little lower than you want your palazzo pants to be. You will reattach the fabric that you trimmed off.








If you want your waist to be a little lower than you measured, you can always cut a bit of fabric off of the folded waistband material that you just trimmed off. However, keep in mind that this is optional.

, You will need to trim the elastic band so that it is slightly smaller than the waistband fabric. Fold the elastic band in half and hold it next to your fabric waistband material. Then, trim along the open edge of the elastic band so that it is a couple of inches smaller than your fabric waistband.








After you have cut your elastic band, sew the edge that you cut to secure the band in a circle. Just sew across the elastic band near the edge of the side you cut.

, Take the waistband fabric and turn it so that the print is facing outwards. Make sure that the waistband is doubled. If it is not, then fold it in half all the way around to double the material.








Check the edges to ensure that they are all even. The edges will need to be lined up in order to sew the waistband onto the pants.

, Take your elastic waistband and begin tucking it in between the waistband fabric. Push the elastic band up towards the fold, which will be the top of the waistband of your palazzo pants. When you are finished, the elastic band should not be visible.







, Hold the waistband so that the top fold is facing down towards your pant legs. Then, pull the waist of your palazzo pants through the waistband and line up the edges. The open edges of the waistband should be even with the edges of the waist. Pin these edges together to secure them.








Make sure that the pins go all the way through the waistband material and the waist. Space them about three inches apart all along the edge of the waist.

, After you have pinned the waistband to the waist, sew along this area.Stretch the fabric as you sew to ensure an even stitch with no bumps or ripples. Make your stitch about an inch away from the edge.









You can remove the pins as you go or take them out after you have finished sewing the edge.
After you have taken out the pins, flip up your waistband and try on your new palazzo pants!

Gather materials.,
Turn your sweatpants and shorts inside out.,
Lay your sweatpants down on a flat surface, such as a floor or table.,
Lay your shorts on top of it, making sure the hems line up.,

If you want to, decorate!",How to Make Sweatshorts," See ""Things You'll Need.""
, Since you'll be tracing the shorts onto the pants, you don't want to risk the chance of staining the outside of your pants!, Smooth it out and make sure it is even., If the hems don't line up, your shorts will not be the right length., Try to make the line as smooth and even as possible. It may be helpful to have someone hold out the fabric of the pant leg as you trace. This line is the length of your shorts., This line is where you'll cut the shorts, since to make the hem, you'll need some additional fabric to fold up.

Again, it may be helpful to have someone hold the fabric while you trace.

, Make sure you use sharp scissors and cut the line as straight as possible.,

Make sure the bobbin and the thread are the same color! The bobbin, since it's hidden, is easy to forget about - but it can make a big difference if you have blue and orange thread!
Take off the part on your sewing machine that can be removed to sew things like sleeves - it will be a whole lot easier to sew the legs of the pants!
Make sure the sewing machine is threaded properly - nothing is more annoying than sewing a whole project, then realizing the bobbin wasn't threaded!

, If you pin the wrong way, you'll sew it the wrong way- and have the hem of your shorts on the front!, Make sure you are folding the fabric so the front fabric shows on the inside of the shorts. As you fold, pin. If you fold it all at once, it will just become unraveled.

It may help to do it one leg at a time.

, Make sure you move the leg around in one smooth, even line. If you are making a double hem, sew a second line in the same manner.,, Use a serger or make a French seam.
, This will give them a crisp look., Since you're already making a new item, why not make it look completely new? Here are some ideas:

Paint designs onto the legs.
Add jewels.
Cut off two strips on the sides of each leg and tie them.

Cut the sheet to double the length you just measured, measuring from one of the elasticized ends.

,
Pin the elastic together to form a circle, and check that you are able to stretch the elastic enough to wear it, and that it isn't too loose or too tight around your waist.,
Sew the length of the sheet together.,
Fold the material back on itself so you have a double thickness tube of fabric.,
Sew the tops of the fabric together.,
Turn the skirt the right way around and try it on, make sure that it is the right length and that it fits you.,
Take one of the side pieces of the sheet and, with the hem at the top, wrap it around you, underneath your arms, crossing the hems over at the front.

,
Cut off the excess length of the material.

,
Tuck the top into the skirt and pin the top part to the skirt where the hems cross over and at each side.

,
Mark the line where the top of the dress will meet the skirt, while wearing the dress, with pins in the top part of the dress.,
Take off the dress and stretch out the skirt enough to sew the top part of the dress to it, following the line you marked with the pins.

,
Sew the back of the dress to the skirt, once again stretching out the skirt just enough to do this.

,
Cut off any excess material from the top.

",How to Make a Dress from a Fitted Bedsheet1,"


Fitted bedsheets are the type which have elastic at both ends, to hold the sheet onto the bed. While you can still make this dress with a normal sheet it will require more effort as you will have to sew the elastic in yourself.
You will need either a double (135cm/53 inches wide) or king (150cm/59 inches wide) sized fitted bed sheet, depending on your size and the size of skirt that you want.
Check that you can't see through the material from any side, no matter how hard you look. If there is any simple, or even non-simple, way to see through it, don't use it - it will show your underwear, guaranteed. This trumps everything else, from sales to pushy store employees to softness and comfort. This may be a problem with cheap or pale coloured sheets.
If you are recycling an old sheet, make sure it doesn't have any worn patches or marks.

, These will be near where the elasticized parts end, you can identify them by the seams there. Find the place where the seam starts (not at the edge of the sheet)

, The line to cut along is usually clear from the creases from the way the sheet is folded in the packet.

, When tackling the elasticated part, be careful that you don't lose the elastic inside the rest of the sheet. Then put the side pieces to one side so you can work on the main part of the sheet.

, Just above the knee is usually a good length for this type of skirt, if you aren't sure.


It's often a good idea to get a friend to help with this step, as measuring yourself can be difficult. If you do do this yourself, make sure you don't bend down to check the measurement, you'll end up making it shorter than you intended.

,, When you're happy with this, sew the ends of the elastic together.

, This should leave you with a tube of fabric with one elasticized end.

, The ""rough"" side of your fabric should be on the inside. Make sure you keep the seam lined up at the top.

, Stretch out the elastic to make this job easier.

, There should be plenty of extra stretch in the elastic when taking it on and off, as you will lose some of the elasticity when you attach the top part of the dress.

,,,, Do not pin to the skirt.

",How to Line a Pinafore Dress While Hiding the Seams," Skirt, Blouse, and sleeves.
Each section will need to be cut out in two layers and sewn separately before assembling the final dress.
The lining material should be either the same as the dress material or a somewhat lighter weight material for ease of sewing. If using the same material for both layers, you will need to identify which side is which in some way... masking tape or tailors chalk would both serve this purpose.;
, Make sure that the material is smooth from wrinkles by ironing it prior to using. Iron the pattern also, to remove the folds.

, Placement of the pattern properly can allow you to use all areas of the material without wasting space.

Scissors
Sewing chalk
Sewing kit
A drawstring
Jeans or pajama pants that fit you
Fabric;
, Wash and dry your fabric as per the care instructions that are usually found on the bolt of fabric purchased at the store. This prevents the fabric from shrinking after you make your pants and wash them.


, Do this with the fabric on the wrong-side out. Using a pair of pants that fit you, trace an outline for your new pants using the sewing chalk. To do this, fold your pants in half, pulling out the crotch seam to that they lay completely flat from waist to ankle. Trace the outline on both pieces of fabric.



Jeans are harder to fold perfectly flat than other fabrics.
Avoid pants with cargo pockets.

, Add ½” around both sides of your outline. Duplicate this on your second outlined piece of fabric and cut along this outline.


, In order to anchor your stitch, insert the needle into the wrong side of the fabric, up through the right side. Move the needle 1









A proper anchor will help your stitch last longer than the fabric.
If you have sewing machine, simply hit the reverse button and back stitch 2-3 stitches to create an anchor stitch., From your anchor stitch, continue with straight stitches that are ¼” away from the edge of the fabric. The stitches should be 1/8” thick and continue from crotch to ankle.










A straight stitch is the default setting “Pattern 01” on a sewing machine. You’ll have to select the stitch length. 3.5 will work perfectly for your pants. Zigzag stitch raw edges to prevent your fabric from fraying. This is “Pattern 06” for most sewing machines. , Start at the bottom of the crotch. Properly anchor your stitch and straight stitch to the waistline. Repeat this with the back of the pants.


, Measure two inches from the top of the waistline to the center seam. From this pint, measure 1 ½” to the right and left. Mark a 1” vertical line on each side with your sewing chalk. There should be 3” between each line and they should be the same distance from the center seam.

, Stitch along these vertical lines using a buttonhole stitch—this gives the fabric strength and support. Anchor your thread and then turn your needle toward the fabric. Insert the needle into the wrong side of the fabric and pull 1









This should create a looped knot at the top of the fabric.
Continue this stitch, making sure they are very close together.
1/8” is a recommended size. However, you can use anything smaller than ¼”.
If you’re using a sewing machine, “Pattern 07” will work for this buttonhole. , Using a safety pin, attach your drawstring to one side of your buttonhole. Then, fold your waist over it. Straight stitch all the way around.









, Put your pants on (inside out) and decide how long you want them to be. Fold in and pin the bottom hem where you want them to be. Straight stitch along your hem ½” from your raw edge. You can decide to make Capri’s or shorts here.
You can also stitch along the bottom of the hem for a finished look.

, If you want to add some flair to your pants, this can easily be done by taking fun shapes of fabric and attaching them. Use a glue stick to temporarily attach your patch and then sew around it using the stitching of your choice. , If you decide you need a pocket, you can easily attach one on the back side of your pants. Simply use your scrap fabric to cut the size pocket you want. Use a straight stitch to attach it. "

Fold your shorts in half. Make sure that the front pockets are on the outside.
Trace the outline of your folded shorts on craft paper.
Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) around the bottom and sides of the pattern for a seam allowance.
Add 1.5 inches (4 cm) to the top of the pattern for a waistband.
Cut the pattern out with scissors.;
, Fold your fabric in half and lay your pattern out on top. Pin in place.


The long side or center of the pattern should be placed along the folded edge of the fabric.
For a more accurate approach, sketch the outline of the pattern onto your material.

, Use sharp sewing shears to cut along the outline. This will create one full side of your shorts.

, Make another piece for your shorts using the same pinning and cutting method used for the first piece.


Fold your fabric in half and lay your pattern out on top, with the long side of the pattern along the folded edge. Pin in place.
Cut around the pattern to form another piece.

, Unfold your two pieces and line them together with the right sides facing each other and the wrong sides facing out. Pin together.


More specifically, pin along the two rounded seams of each piece. These seams are the ones you will be stitching together next, so keeping them evenly aligned is essential at this point.

, Use a sewing machine to sew along the rounded seams.


If sewing by hand, use a backstitch.
Allow for a 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance.
You should be left with what appears to be a single connected ""tube"" of fabric.

, Turn the fabric over so that the stitched seams sit in the center front and center back of the fabric.


After sewing the two separated pieces together, the sewn seams will be on the outside edges. You'll need to rotate the shorts so that these seams are down the vertical center and evenly aligned with each other.
These sewn seams will end up forming the crotch of the shorts.

, Flatten the fabric so that the opening below the center line of the crotch can be seen easily. Pin along both sides of this material and sew together to complete each leg.


Use seam allowance of 1 inch (2.5 cm).
Sew these sides together using a zig-zag stitch.
These seems will fall out along the inner thigh.

, Fold over the upper edge of the fabric, leaving enough room for your elastic band. Pin in place, then sew along the raw edge to stitch the waistband down.


Fold over the top 2 inches (5 cm). This should give you enough room for the waistband elastic.
Sew a straight stitch with your sewing machine or a backstitch by hand.
Leave a small hole along the seam so that you can thread the elastic through it.

, Insert the elastic through the opening in the waistband and push it along the waistband until it reaches all the way around. When done, sew the opening in the waistband closed.


The elastic should be about the same size as your waist, minus roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm). Since elastic needs to stretch to stay secure, this extra space will make sure that the shorts stay snug on your waist.
Clip a safety pin to one end of the elastic to make it easier to feed the band through.
Alternatively, tape the elastic to a long chopstick to make it easier to feed through.
Pull both ends of the elastic through their respective openings along the waistband. Hold them taut as you zig-zag stitch the elastic together and the opening closed.

, Fold up the bottom edge of each leg by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Pin in place and sew around the leg opening to create a hem. This completes your shorts.


Use a seam allowance of about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
Make sure that you do not sew the front and back of the shorts together. You need to sew the hemmed fabric around the opening of the leg.
When done, turn the shorts right-side out again and try them on.

You can find the pattern used in conjunction with these instructions here: http://www.craftpassion.com/wp-content/uploads/PDF%20Pattern/Boxer%20Short%20Pattern.pdf

As you print the pattern out, set the printer for A4 paper and do not check the ""scale printing"" box.
Follow the instructions on the pattern to piece everything together. Each corner is labeled with numbers, and you can create the full pattern by matching these numbers together.
Cut the patterns out and tape them together at the appropriate places.

, Place the pattern on the wrong side of the fabric and pin in place.


For added accuracy, use a piece of chalk or sewing pencil to sketch an outline of the pattern onto the wrong side of the fabric after pinning the two items together.
Note that the seam allowance is included in most patterns, included the one provided here.
Fold the lining fabric so that it becomes a double layer. When pinning the waist band lining, pin the pattern with the ""fold"" marking lined up with this folded edge.

, Cut along the sewing lines until each piece has been cut out.


Use sharp sewing shears for this.
Cut the pieces out in reverse order. In other words, the last piece you need should be the first piece you cut out, and the first piece you need should be the last you cut out. This way, as you stack the pieces together, you will end up with the first piece on top of the stack.

, Pin the pocket pieces onto the correct portions of the shorts pattern as marked on the patter itself. Use a double top stitch to sew the sides and bottom of the pocket in place.


Use an iron to press all four edges of the pocket pieces.
Before pinning the pockets to the shorts fabric, double top stitch the top hem of the pocket. This edge will be the pocket opening.
After doing these two steps, you can pin and sew the back pockets in place as described.

, The method used on the front pockets is the same as that used on the back pockets.


Use an iron to press all four edges of the pocket pieces.
Before pinning the pockets to the shorts fabric, double top stitch the top hem of the pocket. This edge will be the pocket opening.
Pin the pocket pieces onto the correct portions of the shorts pattern as marked on the patter itself.

, Pin the back portions of the shorts fabric together and sew along the crotch portion of the pattern.


Pin the pieces together with the right sides facing each other.
Trim one side of the seam to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) using sharp sewing shears. Clip curve the bottom of the crotch seam, as well.
Use a flat felled seam to sew the crotch seam up.

, Sew the inseam and the side seams with the right sides of the pieces facing each other.


After sewing the inseam, serge or overlock the raw edge to prevent excess fraying.
To sew the side seams, use a flat felled seam method.

, Fold the bottom hem up and use a double top stitch to hold it together.


Press the bottom hem with an iron to create a sturdy fold.

, Stitch the waistband lining to the waist with the right sides facing each other.


The joint of the lining should line up evenly with the center of the back waist portion.

, Zigzag stitch the raw ends of the elastic together, overlapping the edges by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).


Make sure that the elastic will fit snug on the wearer's waist. Measure around the wearer's waist. Take this measurement and subtract 3 inches (7.6 cm) from it so that the elastic band has room to stretch out.

, Pin the elastic into the lining and fold the material over the band. Sew it closed to complete the shorts.


Pin the elastic to the center of the back waist.
Fold the band in half, and pin it to the center of the front waist.
Divide the band into a few other equally spaced points along the lining, pinning it to the fabric in another eight to ten places.
Fold the lining edge in the band with the wrong side facing out. Sew along the edge while stretching the elastic band gently.
Turn the shorts so that the right side faces out. Gently stretch the elastic and double top stitch about 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) away from the top and bottom edges.

, Sewing pattern sizes are determined by measurements. You will need to know your waist and hip measurement to figure out the correct size.

, The pattern envelope will include recommendations on the kind and amount of fabric you will need. Fabric store employees are always happy to make recommendations, as well.


Choose a fabric that is easy to work with for this project. Fabrics without much stretch are easier to work with than knits. A cute flannel or a cotton print would make a great choice for a pair of pants.
Be sure to note the care instructions for the fabric you choose; these will be printed on the end of the fabric bolt.

, These will also be specified on the pattern envelope. You will usually need between 2.5 to 3 yards (2.3 to 2.7 m) of fabric, depending on the width of the fabric.


Purchase a spool of thread that will match or coordinate with your fabric. Look for a variety marked ""all purpose"" or ""sew-all.""
Purchase a package of 3/4-inch elastic for the waistband.

, It is important to prewash the fabric before you begin to cut and sew to minimize shrinkage, and to remove fabric sizing and excess dye. Make sure to prewash new fabric separately from other garments to avoid staining your clothes!Machine sew a quick straight stitch 1/2 away from each cut edges of the fabric before washing to prevent loosely-knit fabric from unraveling.
Wash and dry the fabric according to the care instructions. For cotton fabrics, including flannel, machine wash in warm water using your normal detergent, and machine dry on high., If you have your materials ready and your sewing station set up and ready to go, the actual construction of the pants will be a breeze!


Read the pattern instructions included in the envelope.
Thread your sewing machine and load the bobbin with the thread you plan to use.
Set up your ironing board, or prepare an ironing surface. You can lay out several layers of towels on the floor or table to iron on in a pinch.
Prepare a surface for cutting out the pattern and fabric. Remember that scissors can leave dents on wooden surfaces, so you may want to use a sheet of cardboard or a tablecloth to protect your dining room table.

, Your pants pattern should consist of a ""front"" and ""back"" leg piece. Cut the pattern pieces out carefully, following the lines for the desired size.


If the tissue paper pattern is heavily creased or wrinkled, you can iron it with a dry iron on low heat to smooth it out before cutting.
Diamonds or triangle tabs on the edge of the pattern will be used later to match up pieces of fabric. Take care not to cut them off.

,, Most patterns will instruct you to fold the fabric in half before cutting. This way, you end up cutting out two pieces of cloth at once, one for the right leg and one for the left.

, If your fabric is doubled-up, make sure the pins go completely through both layers., Cut through both layers of fabric at the same time, and be sure to cut diamonds or notches where they are marked on the pattern paper.

, You should end up with 4 pieces of fabric: two ""fronts"" and two ""backs,"" one for each pant leg.

, Use a tape measure to measure your waist, then cut a piece of 3/4-inch elastic that is 1 inch (2.5 cm) longer than this length.

, Match up one front and one back leg and place them together with right sides facing. The ""right"" side of the fabric is the side that is worn outside the body, i.e. the part that people will see.


Align the edges and all notches, and pin together the inside and outside seams.
Completely pin up both legs before you start sewing to make sure that everything is matched up correctly. You should end up with two inside-out fabric tubes that are mirror images of one another.

, Sew the outer seam of each pant leg first. Then sew the inner seams of each pant leg. Alternately, you could sew one leg up completely, and then do the other.

, This is an important step to make sure the two legs can be joined together smoothly, and that you don't create awkward bunches and twists at the seams., Begin by turning one sewn pant leg right side out, then insert this pant leg into the other, so that right sides of the fabric are touching. Now pin the crotch seam of the two pant legs together, making sure that all seams and notches are aligned. (The crotch seam will look like a ""U"" in shape.)

, For extra durability, you can also use a heavy-duty stitch, or add a second row of stitching 1/8"" away from the first.

, You are nearly done with your pair of pants!

, Fold the top of the pants down 1/4"" and press, then fold down another 1 1/4"" and press again. Stitch 1/8"" from the bottom of the casing, all the way around the pants, leaving a 2"" gap to insert the elastic.

, Attach a large safety pin to one end of the elastic, and use this to thread the elastic into the casing you have made at the top of the pants. You can also use a bodkin for this task.


Stitch the ends of the elastic together using a zig-zag stitch. Make sure you have no twists in your elastic first!
Finish the waistband by sewing the gap you left for the elastic closed.

, First try on the pants to decide how long you want them to be. A helper at this stage can come in really handy! Mark the desired length of the pants with pins or a washable fabric marker.


If the unfinished pants are more than an inch longer than you'd like them to be, trim off the excess material at the bottom.
Fold the bottom of each pant leg over 1/4"" and press, then fold them over another 3/4"" and press again. Pin the hems, and sew 1/2"" from the bottom of the pants. (The pants should still be inside-out for this step!)

, Be sure to remove all pins and turn the pants right side out before putting them on.

Bring the stitch from the top of the fold to the fabric of the adjacent leg. Pick up only 2 to 3 threads from the fabric of the leg.
Keep stitches 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) apart while sewing a hem.
Tie off thread with small, short knots.

, Make sure the hems are even and smooth.

Cut loose threads away from the damaged area.,
Thread the needle and tie the knot properly.,
Sew over the edges of the hole to prevent further fraying.,
Sew the gap in the clothing shut.",How to Fix the Crotch Hole in Your Jeans1," You can fix some small holes without using a patch, simply by sewing the sides of the small hole or tear back together. Before you do this, you should use some scissors to clean up the edges of hole so there aren’t any protruding loose threads. These will only get in the way as you work. Be careful not to make the hole any bigger as you do this.


Just cut frayed threads, not the actual fabric of the jeans.;
, Placing a knot at the far end of the thread will anchor it in the fabric once you start sewing. It can be frustrating to have to keep re-threading the needle, so be sure to get the thread tightly fixed.

, Seal the edges of the damaged area by looping thread around them and “tying” them shut. Be sure not to stitch so close to the edge that the thread simply pulls more jean fabric loose. This step is optional, but it can help stop fraying around the hole and increase the strength of your fix.


A blanket stitch or buttonhole stitch are good options for this.

, Press or hold the fabric so that the hole or tear in your jeans is nearly or completely shut. Then sew vertically across the hole to close it. (Note that you may have to stitch over this more than once to make it tight.) Start your stitches around a ½ inch to one side of the hole. Continue them to around ½ inch past the other side of the hole.


As you past the far-side of the hole, make the stitches gradually smaller.
Pull the thread tight, tie it off, and trim it so there are no loose ends.Start these stitches at least ½ inch further back than the stitches you just used to seal the edges of the gap.
You could also do this with a sewing machine, but if it is a very small hole, it could be just as easy to fix it by hand.

Cut away the loose threads.,
Wind the bobbin on the sewing machine.,
Thread the spool.,
Thread the bobbin.,
Seal the edges of the rip with a zig-zag stitch.,
Sew across the hole or tear to close it.",How to Fix the Crotch Hole in Your Jeans2," As with the method for sewing by hand, the first thing to do is to clean up the hole or rip by trimming away any loose or dangling threads. Take care as you do this and try to be as precise as possible.

, Threading the needle on a sewing machine can be a bit tricky as they use two sources of thread, one from the bobbin and one from the spool. The first thing to do is wind the bobbin so that it is wrapped with thread. Once the spool and bobbin are in place on the top of your machine, unravel a few inches of thread towards the far left side of the spool and wrap it around the nubbin on the left hand side of your machine.Then pull this thread to the bobbin, thread it through the small hole, and wrap it around the bobbin a few times to secure it.
Fix the bobbin in place by pushing it to the right and then gentle press down on your peddle to wind the thread from the spool to the bobbin until you have as much thread as you need on the bobbin.
Cut the thread to separate the spool and bobbin, then remove the bobbin and switch off your machine.

, Take the end of the thread from the spool and pull it out to the left as before. This time you are taking it down to the needle itself. You will have to take the thread through a hook on the top of the machine and down along a channel on the right hand side of the needle, before bringing it back up to the top of the machine through another channel on the left, round the hook on the top and back down the left channel.Thread the needle through the hooks on the front and side of the needle itself before finally threading it through the needle itself.
They will most likely be arrows or directions marked on your machine to make this easier.Most machine follow the same basic pattern for threading., You have threaded the needle from the spool above, and now it's time to thread it from the bobbin below. Open up your machine to reveal the bobbin holder beneath the needle, and remove the small metal bobbin holder. Place your threaded bobbin in the holder and pull a few inches of thread out through the slit in the side, before returning the holder to the machine and closing it.To get the thread from the bobbin up to the sewing surface, gently lower the needle with the hand wheel while holding the spool thread in your other hand.
Bring the needle back up, carefully pull on the spool thread and the bobbin thread should appear., Centre a zig-zag stitch over the edge of the fabric (so that half of each stitch goes through the fabric the other half goes on the outside to tie it shut). Sew along each side of the hole to seal the edges and stop further fraying. Some sewing machines have a “buttonhole” setting or pedal that will work well for this purpose.

, Push together the two sides of the hole with your hands to close it. Once it is securely in position, hold it there and position it beneath the needle on your sewing machine. Then, sew vertically across the hole to bind it and close it. As with the sewing by hand method, be sure to start and finish your stitches ½ inch on either side of the hole.


If you sealed the edges of the tear first, make sure you start these new stitches ½ inch further back to avoid pulling out the earlier stitches.
If the hole is in an especially tight or inconvenient spot, moving your jeans through the machine may present a challenge and sewing by hand could be easier.

"
"
Tidy up threads around the hole.,
Cut a patch to size.,
Apply the fabric mending glue to the patch.",How to Fix the Crotch Hole in Your Jeans3," Gluing on a patch is ideal for those who are not comfortable with a needle and thread, or just want a quick-fix. This might be a good option for work jeans that are more important to you for their utility than their appearance. As with the other techniques, the first thing to do is to cut away any loose threads to clean up the tear or hole.

, Turn your jeans inside out and measure out a piece of excess denim from an old pair of jeans, or whatever you want to patch the hole with. Make sure there is plenty of space on the patch around the torn area so you can apply the glue to the patch.


You can buy fabric patches to use instead of a scrap piece.

, You should follow the specific instructions on given on the bottle, but generally you will have to apply glue to the edges of the patch. You will need to take care to ensure that you don’t put glue on a part of the patch that is going to be showing through on the outside of your jeans. Press the patch down over the hole and secure it there.


Different glues take different amounts of time to dry properly, but it shouldn't take more than a few hours.

"
"
Prepare the hole you are going to patch.,
Place a piece of scrap denim on the other side of the hole.,
Iron the patch.",How to Fix the Crotch Hole in Your Jeans4," Another easy alternative to sewing in a patch is to get an iron-on patch and use that instead. As always, begin by cutting away excess threads so the hole is clear, before turning your jeans inside out and preparing the patch you are going to iron on to your jeans. Measure the hole with a tape measure and cut the patch to size ensuring that there is a clearance of at least ½ inch around the hole.You can measure this by eye, but by using a tape measure, you are less likely to get it wrong and end up wasting a patch by cutting it too small.
Cutting rounded corners on the patch will help prevent it peeling up.

, Whether you are adding the patch to the outside or the inside of the jeans, using a scrap of denim on the opposite side to the patch will prevent the patch sticking to the other side of the jeans and potentially sticking the two sides together. This could seal your jeans shut and you might damage them if you then have to tear the leg open again., With a pre-heated iron you should now place the patch over the hole and iron it down. How long you should do this for could depend on the particular iron-on patches you have, so be sure to read the instructions carefully and follow those. Typically it won’t be for more than 30-60 seconds.


Once it is set, remove the scrap piece from the opposite side and you are good to go.

"
Find a patch or suitable patching material.,
Cut out a patch at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) larger on all sides than the hole.,
Place the patch over the hole, lay your jeans flat, and pin the patch to the jeans.,
Sew in the patch with a sewing machine.,
Or sew it in by hand.,
Re-sew around the perimeter of the hole if necessary.,
Trim any loose edges.",How to Fix the Crotch Hole in Your Jeans5," Sewing in a patch is the most comprehensive, but also labour-intensive, way to fix a larger hole in the crotch of your jeans. This requires some basic command of a needle and thread or sewing machine, but when done well it could be neater and more reliable than gluing or ironing on a patch. Begin by finding a patch for the hole in your jeans.


If placing the patch on the interior, choose a colour that closely matches the colour of your jeans to make it look more natural.
You can be creative with your patches if you want to make a statement or have some fun.Make sure the patch material isn’t thicker than the material of your jeans. If it doesn’t give when you move, it will force the jeans to tear around it instead.

, If you’re cutting the patch from a weave material (like denim), cut diagonally against the weave; if you cut straight along the criss or the cross of the weave, the edges will be more likely to fray.

, Make sure there is no bunching or pulling or the patch will end up bulky and stressed. Unless you’d like to place a colourful or conspicuous patch over the damaged area, slide the patch into the interior of the jeans, which should be kept right-side out.


Another option is to use an iron on patch. Instead of pinning it, you can iron it on and then sew it in for more durability.

, Sew around the perimeter of the hole, removing pins as you go. Don’t sew too near the edges or the torn material will fray and the stitches will fall out. Use the machine's zig-zag stitch. You can also use a straight stitch, but use a back and forth motion which will itself lend a zig-zag shape to the stitching..

, If you sew it in by hand use an overcast stitch. Poke the needle up through the patch near the edge. Plunge the needle and thread back down through the denim just outside the edge of the patch and somewhat forward from where your needle emerged, creating a single diagonal stitch. Once again poke the needle up through the underside of the patch (near the edge and slightly forward) to create another diagonal stitch on the underside of the material.


Repeat until you’ve covered the entire perimeter of the patch in diagonal stitches. When you’re done, do the entire process over again only this time, move in the opposite direction to create diagonal stitches that cross the first set you made. The resulting effect will look like a string of Xs.
Be careful and make sure you are not sewing two sides of your jeans together, or sewing the material from the inside of the pocket to the jean leg or crotch., Now that the patch is firmly in place, you can also sew closer to the edges of the tear to hold it down for a cleaner look. Re-sewing will reinforce the strength of the patch. But be aware that adding layer upon layer of stitches can lead to your jeans becoming stiff and uncomfortable.

, Once you have sewn in the patch, take some pinking shears or scissors and trim away any excess material from patch. This could flap around, itch, or catch on things that might loosen the stitches around your patch.Press the stitches down with an iron to help smooth out the stitches and your patching job is complete.

Cut off the hem of your shorts.,
Throw your shorts into a washing machine.Place the cut shorts into a washing machine and run a standard wash cycle.,
Apply fray glue to the edge.",How to Fray Shorts1," Use pinking shares to cut off the lower hemmed edge of your shorts, cutting just above the bottom edge of each leg.


In order to fray your shorts, you need to create a raw edge. For a slight fray, you should only cut off the very edge without cutting off the stitch holding the edge in place. For a more pronounced yet still slight frayed edge, cut the shorts off just above the straight stitch holding the bottom hem of each leg in place.
Note that you can cut off as much of the material as you would like, really. Just keep in mind that frayed shorts have a tendency to shrink over time as more and more of the edge unravels.
Pinking shears reduces the amount of fraying that occurs. These scissors have saw-toothed or serrated blades, and when used, they create a zigzag pattern on the material instead of a straight edge. This pattern helps to limit the length of the frayed edge.;
, The cycle can be as long or short as you want, but it should include a spin cycle.


Before this step, the fraying may not be very obvious. Afterward, the frayed white edges should really be pronounced.
The spin cycle agitates the material, and as a result, it also helps to fray the raw edge in a very natural-looking way.
For more pronounced results, throw the shorts into the washing machine alone. If you wash them with other clothes, you may end up lessening the effect of the spin and agitation.
You can take advantage of this opportunity to throw in a little detergent and wash the shorts as well, if you would like. This is not necessary, though.
Dry the shorts in a dryer or by air.

, Carefully dab small beads of fray glue along the raw edge, where the fray currently meets with the intact material. Let dry before wearing.


Fray glue holds fabric threads in place, minimizing the amount of future fraying.

"
"
Cut off the hem of your shorts.,
Firmly tug on the loose ends using your scissors.,
Cut a series of horizontal slits coming up from the edge.Use a utility knife to cut small horizontal cuts near the bottom edge of the shorts and along the front or back of the material.,
Put your shorts through a cycle in the washing machine.,
Let things take their course.",How to Fray Shorts2," Use standard, heavy scissors to cut off the lower hem of your shorts, somewhere above the straight seam holding the hem in place.


If you cut below the hem seam, you will limit the amount of fraying, which you do not want to do for this method.
This initial cut should be parallel to the current bottom edge of your shorts.
Use straight scissors instead of pinking shears to maximizing the amount of fraying.

, Use the tip of your scissors to tug down on the loose edges at the newly cut raw edge of your shorts.


Work the scissors all the way around the perimeter of each leg.
This stem helps draw out the frayed fibers along the raw edge of the material.

,


Each series of cuts should be between 1 and 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) in length. Cut half a dozen to a dozen cuts in each series.
The shorts should be spread out on a flat surface when you do this.
Be sure not to cut through the pockets as you do this.

, Place the shorts in a washing machine and run a standard wash cycle, with or without detergent. Regardless of how long the cycle is or what water temperature you use, you should choose a wash with at least one spin cycle.


A spin cycle agitates the material, causing the raw edges to fray more.
Wash the shorts in the machine alone to maximize the amount of fraying that occurs.
The shorts can be dried by machine or by air.

, For maximum fraying, do not attempt to slow the fraying down or hold it in place. Just know that, as the shorts continue to fray with time and wear, they will gradually become shorter and shorter.

"
"
Remove the hem of your shorts.,
Tug down on the loose edges firmly.,
Sew a seam about the slits.,
Wash your shorts in the washing machine.",How to Fray Shorts3," Use scissors or pinking shears to cut off the hem of your shorts, cutting parallel to and just above the long seam holding the hem of each leg in place.


You can cut away as much of the material as you would like, but the cut should always be parallel to your original hem.
Use standard scissors or pinking shears for this method. The former will create more fraying from the start while the latter will limit the amount of initial fraying. Since you will be doing other things to control the amount of fraying, though, pinking shears are not critical.

, Use the sharp tip of your scissors or shears to tug down on the denim fibers around the perimeter of each raw edge.


Doing this helps to draw out the frayed fibers from around the raw edge of each leg.

, To minimize the amount of future fraying, use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the new bottom of the shorts.


Note that if any of the fraying has already extended past this length, alter the position of the new stitch so that it falls somewhere above the uppermost frayed fiber.
You could also hand sew this line, but sewing it by machine may make it sturdier. Additionally, machine sewing is much faster than hand sewing.
This stitch prevents the frayed edge from extending too far up. It acts as a new hem, essentially, preventing the material from unraveling above it.

, Toss your newly cut shorts into the washing machine and run it, putting it through a setting that has a spin cycle.


You can add detergent or skip it this time around. The choice is up to you and will have no effect on the fraying of your shorts.
Similarly, you can dry your shorts by machine or by air without making a difference to the frayed edge.
For best results, wash the shorts this first time around in a small load or by themselves. Doing so will maximize the amount of agitation and, therefore, the amount of fraying.
Note that this completes this method. No fray glue is necessary; the shorts should not fray past your new hem.

Draw an outline.,
Trace the outline with fray glue.,
Cut away the vertical threads along the outline.,
Wash the shorts.",How to Fray Shorts4," Use a fabric pencil or piece of chalk to outline the desired shape of your patch into your shorts.


This method works well if you plan on fraying a patch into your shorts in a particular shape. If you do not want to create a specific shape, you do not need to draw an outline or use fray glue around the edges. Simply cut horizontal slits into the material using a utility knife.
Possible shapes to consider include hearts, stars, or initials.
Consider placing the outline over a pocket. If you place it over the fabric next to your skin, you risk making a cut that will cause your underwear to peak through once you slip the shorts on.

, Apply a light but consistent line of fray glue on the outline you just drew.


Fray glue prevents raw edges from fraying beyond a certain point. If you do not use fray glue along the outline of your shape, the shape will become distorted after you wash and wear it.

, Use a stitch ripper or utility knife to cut away the individual threads around your shape.


Only cut away the vertical threads. Do not cut the horizontal threads.
If cutting blue jean shorts, the horizontal threads will be white while the vertical threads should be blue.
Use your seam ripper or fingers to slowly pull the fibers out from the inside to the outside, revealing the white strands and creating a ""frayed"" look.
Note that this can take considerable time to do, but when done right, it can be well worth the effort.
You may want to apply a bit more fray glue around the edges before washing them to ensure that the shape you cut into the material does not become distorted in the washing machine.

, Wash and dry the shorts as you usually would.


You do not need to rely on the washing machine to fray your shorts further. As a result, you can just use a standard washing and drying cycle with your standard detergent.

Find a cute pair of high waisted jeans.,
Make sure you like the way the jeans fit.",How to Make High Waisted Shorts1," If you want to make high waisted shorts, then you have to find a pair of jeans with the right waist height.This could be an old pair of jeans in the back of your closet, a pair of jeans given to you by a friend, or one that you snagged at Goodwill. It doesn't matter where the jeans came from as long as you don't mind cutting them up.;
, Don't just start cutting up your old pants -- try them on to make sure you like their high waisted look. They should feel comfortable and the waist should be the right height. If the pants are too baggy, they'll fall down below your waist and you won't be able to make high waisted shorts from them.

Using a tape measure, measure and mark with a white fabric pencil the length you would like the dress pants to be.,
Cut off the current excess hems of the dress pants.,
Turn the dress pants inside out.,
While carefully keeping the new hem in place, insert a straight pin directly through the folded hem.,
Thread a sewing needle.,
With both ends of the thread even with each other, knot the bottom once, leaving roughly an inch or so (around 2.5cm) of thread dangling from the end.,
Baste around each hem.,
Once each hem has been basted, remove all of the straight pins.

,
You are now ready to sew each hem with the sewing machine.,
Once you have sewn each hem with the sewing machine, remove the basting.,
Iron the hems.",How to Hem Dress Pants," It is preferable to have the person who needs the pants altered to be wearing them when you are measuring the required length.;
, Leave enough room to fold halfway to the desired hem length. Cut off any long frays to ensure they don't show after the second folding of the hem to create a tidy hem line.

, Fold the bottom hem halfway towards the desired hem length. Press with an iron.

, You will need to insert the end of the straight pin back up so that it is now showing through to the inside of the dress pant hem. Ensure that when you pin the hem, it gathers as little as possible. Using only enough pins to hold the hem in place, continue pinning around each hem.

, The length of the thread should be roughly the length of your arms, spread out to the sides. Take the end of the thread and insert through the eye of the needle. Gently pull through. Holding the thread you just inserted into the eye of the needle between your fingers, spread your arms out with the other hand holding the spool of thread. Bring your hands together in front of you and snip the thread from the spool.

, This will let you know while you are basting the hem that when you feel resistance, you are near the end of the thread and are ready to make the next basting stitch.

, Do this loosely, so that you can remove the these threads by hand afterwards. Make each basting stitch roughly one inch (2.5cm), leaving roughly one inch (2.5cm) between each stitch. Double check before stitching that the hems are even.

,, Choose the stitch you would like to use and place the hem under the needle. Match the colour of thread on the bobbin and the spool to the colour or complimentary colour of the dress pants. You will be stitching near the top of each folded hem.

, It should come out easily.

, Fold once more so you can pin and baste the hems once more to the desired length. Iron and sew as in the previous steps. Remove the basting stitches. Press with an iron.

Mark the desired length of your shorts while you're wearing the pants.,
Lay the marked pants on a flat surface.,
Cut the shorts with a pair of sewing scissors.",How to Make High Waisted Shorts2," You have to keep the pants on when you mark the shorts in the front so you have a more accurate sense of how long the shorts should be. You can use a black felt tip pen, tailor’s chalk, or even a piece of chalkboard chalk. Simply make a mark each leg of the pants so you can use it as a guideline when you’re ready to cut.


If you want to hem the shorts, be sure to allow enough material for hemming; otherwise, your new shorts might be too short for your liking.
Mark the shorts a bit longer than you want them to be, to leave some room for error.
You should try to mark the back of the pants as you're wearing them, but you can mark the back more accurately after you take them off.
You can also lay a pair of your favorite shorts on top of the slacks and mark your cutting line that way—you’ll know you’re getting just the length you want.

, Fold them together and draw your cutting line mark all the way around both legs of the slacks. If you want an even cut, you can pin the two halves together so that they don’t slip and slide while you are marking them.

, Make sure the scissors are sharp, especially if you are cutting through denim. Make slow short cuts to make sure that you're cutting along the line you marked evenly. If you make a drastic cut that makes the shorts too short, you won't be able to undo the damage.

Cut the pants for a distressed look.,
Hem the shorts.,
Dye the shorts.",How to Make High Waisted Shorts3," High waisted shorts look cute if they're distressed, so you can use pinking shears, a box cutter, or an Exacto knife horizontally across the place where you want the rips to be. You should try to create at least one distressed part on each pant leg, and try not to line them up too evenly.


Don't worry if it doesn't look natural -- once you wash your shorts, they will naturally fray and they will look like they've been distressed for years.

, If you want your shorts to be hemmed instead of looking frayed or cut-off at the end, then you can hem them. This will also help them look more even if you didn't cut them perfectly. Here's how you can easily hem your shorts:


Turn the shorts inside out.
Fold the edges up to your desired length.
Stitch the hem with a needle and thread or on a sewing machine.

, Buy some clothing dye and follow the directions on the package. Pick a fun and funky color like hot pink or lime green. Dyeing works best on lighter-colored shorts.

Switch out the needle.
Thread a bobbin.
Set your stitch length to three or higher.;
, Put the shower curtain through a cold, gentle wash cycle to remove soap scum and mold. Run it through the washing machine with small and soft items like hand towels, wash cloths, socks, etc.--The little items will ""scrub"" away the soap scum and residue, leaving a nicely clean plastic liner. To use less water, you can also try soaking the shower curtain in a bleach solution, then scrubbing it with a brush as needed. Hang to dry.

, Set aside the piece you cut off, you'll need it later.

,, This will be the head hole.

,, Look at the image for guidance, or trace a hood from an existing garment. (The folded edge is the part that goes over your head, the curve goes on the back of your head.)

, Here are some things to keep in mind when sewing the curtain:


When you feed it into the sewing machine, put a flat piece of tissue paper underneath it so that the curtain doesn't stick and stall the sewing machine.
Don't sew the same spot more than once, or else the curtain may get weak and tear.
When you're done, tear the tissue paper away.

,, Pin the hood inside of the hole. It helps to carefully try it on a couple times and make sure it lays right.

Turn your pants inside out.,
Measure the waistband.,
Cut an opening 2cm (1 inch) from the button hole.,
Measure the length of the elastic.,
Cut the elastic.,
Guide the elastic through the waistband.,
Sew the elastic to the jeans and close the opening.",How to Fix a Gaping Waistband1," Before you begin altering the size of your waistband you will need to turn your pants inside out. This way, any alterations you make to the pants will not be visible when you are wearing them. For instance, all incisions and sewing will be done on the inside of the pants.;
, Once they are inside out, measure the width of the waistband. You will need to use an elastic that is approximately 1/2 centimeter (¼ inch) to 1 ½ centimeters (½ an inch) smaller than the width of the waistband., To insert an elastic into the waistband of your pants, you will need to cut an opening for the elastic. Make a vertical cut approximately 2 centimeters (1 inch) from the button hole, and then again in the same place on the other side of the waistband.Only cut the inner layer of the waistband. Pinch the inner layer of the waistband and make a small cut using fabric scissors.
Do not cut any closer than 0.5 centimeters from the edges of the waistband. You do not want to accidentally cut the edge of the band.

, Before inserting the elastic, you will need to measure its length. To do this, take the elastic band and wrap it around your waist exactly where the waistband of the pants sit. Pull the elastic tight so that it is comfortable and can hold the pants onto your waist. Create a mark on the elastic to save the measurement., From this measurement, you will need to subtract the length of the waistband that the elastic is not covering. For example, measure across the front of the pants from the one cut you made in the waistband to the other cut. Subtract that measurement from the elastic and cut the elastic using scissors., Attach a safety pin to one end of the elastic and insert it into one of the holes you created in the waistband. Guide the elastic through the waistband until the safety pin comes out the other hole.To avoid pulling the elastic all the way through the waistband and out the other side, you can pin the end of the elastic to the waist band.

, Tuck the end of the elastic into the waistband. About 1cm (¼ inch) of the elastic to should tuck into the button side of the hole. The elastic should overlap with the incision made on both sides of the waistband. Using a thread that matches the color of the pants, sew the hole closed.Make sure that you sew over the elastic in order to secure it in place.
Sew both of the holes closed.
Use a thicker needle if you are working with denim or any other thick fabric.

Cut a small strip of elastic.,
Center the elastic in the back of your pants.,
Sew the elastic onto the waistband.",How to Fix a Gaping Waistband2," If you do not want the look of an elastic waistband, you can sew a small strip of elastic into the back of your pants. This will help to cinch in your waistband in a less noticeable way. Cut a 1 ½ centimeter (½ inch) wide strip of elastic about 15 centimeters (6 inches) long.The length of elastic will vary depending on the size of your waistband. For example, the elastic should reach about half way between the center belt loop and the side belt loop of your pants.

, Turn your pants inside out and center the elastic along the waistband at the back of your pants. To hold the elastic in place, pin it to the pants. Place a pin on either side of the center belt loop, to mark where the belt loop is located.

, Begin near the center of the elastic, on one side of the center belt loop, and use a zigzag stitch. Sew through the center of the elastic until you reach the end. In order to sew a zigzag stitch, select the zigzag stitch on your sewing machine. As you sew, pull the elastic tight and let the material of the pants feed through the machine normally.Then repeat the sewing process, starting on the other side of the center belt loop and sew outwards towards the other side of the elastic.
Remove the pins as you are sewing. Do not sew over a pin because this could break your needle.
Use a thread that matches the color of the pants.

They come in different colors, materials, and widths.


Choose a belt that matches with your overall look.

, If you are not confident in your sewing skills, you can have your waistband altered professionally by taking your pants to a tailor. In order to locate a tailor in your area, complete a Google search for a tailor. Read online reviews to select a tailor with exceptional sewing skills., Some stores will actually offer tailoring when you purchase an item. For example, expensive suits can be altered by the store they are purchased from. When you are purchasing an expensive item, like a suit, make sure that it fits properly and has all necessary alterations made.

, You can roll the pants up to the desired length gradually with one fold. Make sure to stand up straight when pulling up the fold to make sure it sits at the proper length. You can now remove them., If you have a pair of pants that fits you perfectly, use that pair as a model for the pants in question. Lay out the pants you're planning to hem, and then lay your ideal pants directly on top of them. This should show you the excess of the pants you need to remove.

, Use a piece of chalk to mark the location you want hemmed. Make sure that the pants are unfolded and you create a clear mark on each leg. Measuring from the previously-made line, measure and mark three lines at 1/2-inch intervals. There should now be four white chalk lines going down to the edge of the pants.Typically, hems will be about 1/2 an inch wide, so use 1 1/2"" of fabric below the new hem to make a clean edge.
Make sure the lines are even on both legs.

, Once you've decided on the length, fold your pants to the desired hem. Iron the crease of the desired fold. Take a piece of chalk or a pencil and mark the halfway mark. This is the halfway mark between the edge of the fold and the crease. Unfold the leg and mark the crease if you want. The ironed crease should be bold enough to see. , To perfect a clean line to guide your scissors, use a ruler. Make sure you position the ruler's edge to the mark.

Get your scissors out.,
Start at the bottom.,
Use pins.,
Cut till the middle line.,
Cut loose threads.",How to Hem Pants With Sewing Machine2," If you don't have sewing scissors, consider buying a pair. You can also use your regular everyday scissors, but it is easier to use a sharp pair.

, Cut the line closest to the bottom first. Be patient and avoid cutting fast. This will create messy zig-zags instead of a neat edge. Creating multiple lines isn't necessary, but it helps with your accuracy.

, Pins are the perfect tool for cutting adjustments to your clothing. Stretch the width of each leg out and use pins to hold them. This will create a tension in the legs that will make them easier to cut.

, Cut the following lines above your initial cut until you reach the line under the top line. Focus on one leg at a time. Don't cut the topmost line or crease. This line marks where your pants will be hemmed.

, Use your scissors to cut any loose threads that got left behind. You might need to repeat this step near the end or after you wash the pants.

Fold the pants inside out.,
Fold the hem.,
Iron the fold.,
Load your sewing machine.,
Set your machine.,
Begin stitching.,
Repeat on the other leg.,
Done!",How to Hem Pants With Sewing Machine3," Fold the pants so that the outside of the pants are facing out. You should be able to see the inner seam. This will make it easier to sew the hem. You could simply fold the legs inside out without doing this to the entire pants.

, Fold up the hem from the edge up to the top line. Make sure your top line or crease is on the edge of the fold. This edge will be the hem. Make sure the size looks good before you finalize the job.

, Take your pants onto an ironing board. Wait till the iron is fully heated. Then iron the fold down. This will create a professional fold and ensure that you don't have any uneven lines., Load the bobbin with the thread of your choice. You can use matching thread to blend in, or a contrasting color, like the gold thread used on most denim jeans.

, For a simple hem set your machine for a straight stitching, or a small or medium straight thread., Make sure you position your pant leg so the machine only stitches the hem and not the leg's opening together. Sew about 1/8 inch from the top of the hem. Continue sewing in a straight line around the circumference of the leg., Follow the same steps on the other leg. Don't forget to iron the seam on the opposite leg and compare the length with the finished leg. This is your last chance to fix any irregularities in the length.

, You can now wear your jeans.

Start taking measurements.,
Grab your scissors.,
Begin working on the neck area.,
Hem the edges.,
Embellish.",How to Make a Cloak1," Measure the wearer's ankle to shoulder height. After that, measure the person's arm span. If you know you want it bigger, add extra length to the arm span.






;
, Cut a rectangle the length of their ankle-shoulder height and the width of their arm span on the separate sheet of fabric.









Round off the corners, if desired. This is most easily accomplished by folding the rectangle in quarters (in half once lengthwise, then in half once width-wise) and cutting all of the corners at one time so that they are all curved equally.














, Mark the halfway point of the neck edge with a pencil; this is for the center point of the neck divot.









Measure your neck and add two inches to that measurement.













Find the diameter by dividing by Pi or by three (will yield a slightly larger diameter, but in a cloak, that is not a bad thing).
Divide your diameter in half and mark the neck hole by measuring out from the center point to points the distance of that radius from the center point.
Cut the fabric, following your marks.














, Generally a 1/2"" (1.25 cm) seam allowance is sufficient. It will depend on how your fabric cuts -- some felts don't even need to be hemmed.








, Attach a brooch, clasp etc., onto one side and pin it through to the other. This will keep the cloak securely on the wearer. If you don't have one, hit up your local thrift shops for inexpensive costume jewelry.

Make some measurements.,
Cut it out and start sewing.,
Attach a closure.",How to Make a Cloak2," You'll need to know how much fabric will look right. Measure from the top of the shoulder, up over the head to top of the other shoulder. This will give you your length.









Mark a piece of fabric with the appropriate length. Then, measure from the top of head to the back for the length of hood; make it longer if you want it to come partially down over the face.














, You may find it easier if you fold it in half so the short sides are together. Those short sides will attach to the cloak itself; one of the long sides must be sewn together to create the back of the hood.









Once you have sewn one of the long sides together, sew the short sides to the edge of the cloak. The long side will form a seam from the cloak to the top of the head; the short sides will form a seam along your neck.














, That is, if you do not have a closure on the cloak itself. You can use a pin, sew strings on it to tie, sew frogs on it, or use anything else you would think appropriate.









For kids, frogs since are the easiest to work with and safer than pins. These do not look like frogs -- they sort of look like fleur de lis, are fabric, and wrap together to stay closed.

Cut a fringe into the hem.,
Consider adding beads onto the fringe.,
Decorate the shirt further, if desired.",How to Make a 80s Style Tee Shirt1," Bright, neon colors were very popular in the 80s, but you can use a neutral color as well, such as black, white, or grey. You will be cutting this shirt up, so make sure it's one you don't mind permanently altering. A blank shirt would work best, but you can use a decorated one too.
, Begin by making a snip 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) from each shoulder seam. Connect the snips with a curved line, just below the collar. This will give you an off-the-shoulder look.You can cut through both layers of fabric at the same time for something quick and easy.
For a more professional finish, cut the front neckline lower than the back.

, You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to turn your shirt from a t-shirt to a tank top. Cut the sleeves off following the seam on the shirt body, not the sleeve. You can make the arm holes bigger by cutting a littler further down past the armpit., You can cut as much of the hem off as you want. For a high-low look, cut the front hem higher than the bottom one., It needs to go about a quarter of the way up the shirt. The tassels need to be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) wide.Try to cut through both layers of fabric. This way, you can be sure that the fringes are even on both sides of the shirt. You'll also save some time.

If you made a high-low hem, cut the fringes separately. Make sure that they are the same length (however many inches/centimeters long you choose) on both sides of the shirt.

, Twist the tassel into a tube, then thread it through a plastic bead, such as a pony bead. You can add as many beads as you want; 1 to 3 would be ideal. Knot the tassel below the bead.You can also use a large yarn needle to thread the beads onto the tassels.
Alternate the colors and the number of beads on the tassels.

, You can leave the shirt as is, or you can decorate it further. If the shirt is blank, consider adding an iron-on transfer. You can also paint the shirt instead using fabric paint."

Peel the paper off.",How to Make a 80s Style Tee Shirt2," Transfer paper prints are usually translucent, so the shirt's color will show through. For best results, use a white shirt. If you must have a colored shirt, be aware that the image may not be as bright. You can also use transfer paper meant for dark shirts, but it will have a white background. You will have to trim around the image, or the white will show up.Baggy t-shirts were very popular in the 80s.If you want something more modern that is simply vintage inspired, you can use a fitted shirt instead.
If you want something that looks vintage, consider using an old shirt. The more faded, the better.

, Logos from 1980s cartoons work the best. Look for something that is larger than your hand, and has the title of the show as well as some of the characters. Make sure that you get the right generation, however; many of the original cartoons got reboots. For example, the new My Little Ponies look very different from the original ones. This will defeat the whole vintage look.

Some of the most popular ones were: Thundercats, Mighty Mouse, and Rainbow Brite.Care Bears, My Little Pony, and Popples were also popular.
You can also use other popular films and shows, such as: Back to the Future, Dark Crystal, Ghostbusters, Labyrinth, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, etc.
You can also use logos from bands and other things that were popular in the 80s, such as MTV or the Cabbage Patch dolls.

, Copy the image from your web browser, then paste into an image editing program. Use the mirror or flip option to reverse the image. If your image has words on it, they will be backwards.

If the image is too big, you can shrink it. If the image is too small, you can try to enlarge it, but be aware that you may loose some quality.
If you are using dark transfer paper, you typically don't have to reverse the image., Craft stores and fabric stores sell many different types of transfer paper, so make sure that you get the right kind for your shirt. If you have a white shirt, you can use any type of transfer paper. If you have a colored shirt, you will need to get one designed for colored shirts.

Remember to print on the coated side of the transfer paper.Some transfer papers are made specifically for certain types of printers, so double-check before buying it. It needs to match your printer.

, Some types of transfer paper, like the kind used for dark shirts, have a white background. If you don't trim this background off, it will show up on the finished product. Use a small pair of scissors to carefully trim around the image., Make sure that the image is centered. The top of the image should reach just past the armhole. If you are using dark transfer paper, you will typically have to place it image-side-up; double-check the instructions., Different types of image transfer papers have different requirements, so read the directions carefully., The image should be transferred onto the shirt. Don't worry if it doesn't look perfect. This will help give it a vintage feel."

A white shirt will show colors the best, but you can use a colored one as well. Make sure that the shirt is blank, without any colors or patterns on it., The cardboard needs to be the same size as the shirt. It will prevent the paint from getting onto the back of the shirt., Start by making a large rectangle on your shirt with painter's tape. Lay down more strips of tape at different angles and lengths to create a geometric pattern. Smooth down the edges of the tape against the shirt.

Cut the tape in half lengthwise to create thinner pieces and borders.
For a simpler design, create large squares over the shirt. Make some tilted at different angles.

, This is only necessary if you will be splattering the paint on. If you will be painting it on, you can skip this step., Try to use a few different colors, the brighter, the better., You can apply the paint as a solid color, or you can splatter it on instead. Use a new foam brush for each color; if you are using a bristle brush, simply rinse it.

Use a sponge brush to pounce the paint onto the shirt. Don't drag it, or you might get paint under the tape.Use a stiff-bristled brush to splatter the paint onto your design., If you wait until the paint dries, you will risk peeling the paint away too. Be careful not to smudge the wet paint., Every so often, run your hand inside the shirt to separate it from the cardboard. If you don't do this, the shirt may stick to the cardboard., This is a great idea for shirts painted a solid color, but you can do this for splatter painted shirts too. Use black or a contrasting color to draw free-hand designs onto your shirt. Try using round or organic shapes, such as spirals, squiggles, or suns to make them stand out.If you painted your shirt a solid color with a foam brush, consider splattering paint over it with a stiff bristle brush.

, Button the shirt up all the way. As this will be difficult while it is inside out if you would like you can do it before turning it inside out, if it is large enough to fit over your head.


If you usually wear button down shirts with undershirts, you should put an undershirt on when doing this.

,, Pin the area where the sides of the shirt meet with the pin facing downward vertically. , Measure the amount that you have pinched in. Generally, you want to keep it to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) or less, to avoid problems with pockets moving too far to the side. With men’s shirts, you should avoid darting in at the waist during fitting. With women’s shirts, you can pin an extra half inch (1.27 cm) at the waist to create a more fitted look.

, After you pinch and pin the top of the body, measure it to ensure it matches the measurement on the opposite side. You want to alter it equally on both sides.

, If the arm width fine, you can skip this step. Measure to ensure you are taking approximately the same amount off of each side.


Pin horizontally, with the pin tips facing toward the arm cuff.
Move around, sit down and move your arms to ensure you have enough space for movement in the shirt.

, Several needles, and a skein of each color of thread you will need for your design.

, There are embroidery hoops of every size available, but not all baby clothing is large enough to use one.

,, Some stitches such as French Knots work best with the full 6 strands of thread normally found in Embroidery floss. Finer details will require using fewer strands at a time to accomplish the effect desired. A common number of strands is two, but you should use your own best judgment.

, Both methods have their advantages. Dark thread first prevents getting your lighter colors dingy with repeated rubbing and holding of the piece during stitching. Working out from the center has the advantage of being adjusted as you go. (starting at the outside will restrict any changes you can make later.)

, Even the gentlest of tugs on the embroidery floss can pucker the fabric and make the garment not fit correctly when you're finished.

Be aware that any narrowing of the trouser leg is easiest accomplished at the side seams. Narrowing somewhere besides a seam causes some difficulties, and it's best to stick with the seams if at all possible.

, If your trouser leg opening is too small to pull your foot through, you may need to add a slit with a zipper or button closure to the bottom of the leg. Alternatively, you can allow a bit more leg room. Just move the pins out a way and test again.
,, Use starch if necessary to help straighten out a ""laundered in"" cuff.

This may also work on other shirts made from stretchy material. It is not recommended for shirts made out of woven material, such as linen, due to fraying.;
, If you want to be extra need, draw a line using a dressmaker's chalk or pen first, so you will know where to cut. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt as you draw the line. This will ensure that the shirt will be the same length all around.

, This will be the inside of your hem. Your shirt should now be the exact length you want it to be. You don't have to double-fold or finish the raw edge, because T-shirt material does not fray much, if at all. If you want a nicer finish on the inside, then you can serge the raw edge, but it is not necessary., Make sure that you use a heat setting that is safe for the material your shirt is made out of. This will give your shirt a nice, crisp edge all along the bottom.

, If you do not own a sewing machine, or if you do not know how to sew, slip some iron-on hem tape into the hem first. The results will be stiffer, but at least you won't have to do any sewing.

, Use a color that matches your shirt, and remove the pins as you sew. For a more professional finish, you can use a double-pointed needle. Alternatively, you can sew a second line right beneath the first one; this only works with the stretch-stitch, however.If you are using iron-on hem tape, simply iron over the hem following the instructions on the package.
Be sure to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling.
Try to start sewing at one of the side seams. This will help conceal the start and end of your sewing better.

Figure out how short you want your shirt to be, and make a mark on the outside of the shirt.,
Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw a line all around the shirt at an even distance from the bottom edge.,
Fold the hem up until the bottom edge touches the line that you drew.,
Sew around shirt, as close to the selvage edge as you can.,
Fold hem back down, and tuck the excess fabric inside the shirt, away from the bottom of the hem.,
Press the hem with an iron.,
Top stitch as close to your seam as possible.,
Turn the shirt inside-out and cut the excess material away.,
Turn shirt right-side-out.",How to Hem Shirts2," If you want to, you can put the shirt on to determine the new length. Keep in mind that your shirt will be about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) longer, depending on how wide the original hem is.

, Spread the shirt out on a flat, even surface, right-side-out. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt every so often. This will ensure that your shirt is the same length all the way around.If you can't find a dressmaker's chalk or pen, you can make the line using sewing pins instead; just be careful not to pin both sides of the shirt together.

, Keep folding your way all around the shirt. It should now be a little shorter than before.


You are still folding on the outside of the shirt. Do not fold the hem on the inside.

, Use the zigzag stitch or the stretch stitch on your sewing machine. Make sure that your thread color closely matches your shirt., Keep your shirt right-side-out. You should now see the original hem, the hem's original stitching, and your new ""seam"" just above it.

, Focus on the new seam you made. This will flatten it, and make the bottom of your shirt smoother. If you'd like, you an secure the hem with sewing pins, although this is not necessary.

, Anywhere between ⅛ to 3/16-inch (3.2 to 4.3 millimeters) away will be plenty.Use a stretch stitch for this step, and be sure to go back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling.


Start sewing from one of the side seams. This will help hide the start and end of your sewing better.
If you secured your hem with sewing pins, be sure to pull them out as you sew.

, Try to cut as close to your stitching as you can. Discard the excess material, or save it for another project. When you are done, go back over your shirt and snip off any excess or loose threads.

, Your shirt is now ready to wear.

Figure out how long you want your shirt to be, and make a mark ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) below it.,
Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to draw a line all around bottom of shirt, using the mark as a guide.,
Draw another line ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) below it, and cut along that second line.When you are done, you should have a shorter shirt, with a line drawn all along the bottom edge.

,
Fold the bottom edge of the shirt upwards, using the first line that you drew as a guide.,
Press the hem flat with an iron.,
Fold hem up by another ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) again, and press it flat with an iron.,
Secure the hem with sewing pins, then sew as close to top edge of hem as you can using a straight stitch.,
Snip off any excess or loose bits of thread.",How to Hem Shirts3," If you need to, put your shirt on first. You are making the shirt longer, because you will be folding the hem twice to conceal the raw edges and prevent fraying.


This method may work with other non-button-up shirts made from woven material, such as tunics and peasant blouses.

, Spread your shirt out on a flat surface in front of you, with the inside facing you. Draw a line along the bottom edge of the shirt. Use a ruler to measure up from the bottom edge of the shirt to the line that you are drawing. This will ensure that the line is an even distance from the bottom edge of the shirt. Most button-up shirts have a curved hem, so your line should curve as well.If you want your shirt to have a flat bottom, simply draw a line straight across the bottom of the shirt. Align it with the shortest part of the shirt, usually at the side seams.

,, You are folding the hem up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), so the first line that you drew should now be inside the hem, right along the crease., Make sure that you are using a heat setting that is suitable for the material you are working with.

, This will give you a clean, professional-looking hem. The raw edges should now be concealed inside the hem., An easy way to do this is to align the edge of the sewing machine's foot with the bottom edge of the shirt. Remove pins as you sew, and be sure to use a thread color that matches the fabric of your shirt.


Remember to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing. If your shirt is not a button-up shirt, start sewing at one of the side seams. This will conceal the beginning and ending of your sewing better.

, Your shirt is now ready to wear!

Get some single-fold bias tape that closely matches the color of your shirt.,
Cut your shirt a little bit longer than you want it to be.,
Unfold one edge of the tape, and pin it to the bottom edge of your shirt.,
Sew the bias tape to your shirt using a straight stitch.,
Fold the bias tape to the inside of your shirt.,
Press the hem flat with an iron.,
Tuck the excess bias tape into the hem, and press it flat with an iron.,
Secure everything in place with sewing pins, then sew the bias tape down using a straight stitch.,
Give the shirt hem a final press, and snip off any excess or loose threads.",How to Hem Shirts4," If you can't find a matching color, choose a neutral color that is a similar shade. For example, if you have a dark blue shirt, and you can't find any dark blue bias tape, get black bias tape. If you have a light blue shirt, and can't find any matching bias tape, get some light grey bias tape instead.


This method works great on shirts that you are sewing from scratch!

, How much longer you cut it depends on the width of your bias tape. This will typically be about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters).

, Make sure that you are pinning the right side of the bias tape to the right side of the shirt. You will eventually be folding the bias tape inside the shirt.Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of extra bias tape to either side of the shirt., Use the crease along the bottom fold of the bias tape as a guide.

, Fold the bias tape down first, then fold it inside your shirt. The raw edges should now be under the bias tape. The bias tape also should not be visible from the outside. The seam between the bias tape and the shirt will be right along the bottom edge of the shirt., Use a heat setting that is suitable for the material you are working with. Each fabric will require a different heat setting.

, If you'd like, you can clip the corner of the bias tape first to reduce bulk., Sew with the inside of the shirt facing you, so that you can get as close to the top edge of the bias tape as possible. Use a bobbin thread that matches your shirt color, and a sewing thread that matches your bias tape color.Remember to sew back and forth a few times at the start and end of the shirt.
Pull out the pins as you go.

, Your shirt is now ready to wear!

Find a pair of old (or new) overalls.,
While wearing the overalls, use a pen to mark the inseam.,
Using a ruler, measure 3–4 inches (7.6–10.2 cm) below the mark you made at the inseam.,
Measure how far the cutting mark is from the bottom of the leg.,
Fold the overalls in half.,
Bleach the overalls (optional).,
Add color (optional).,
Put on the overall shorts.,
Add whatever embellishments please you.",How to Create Overall Shorts," A good pair is one that isn't really getting worn because they're unfashionable. Any color is fine, ranging from navy to white. Try them on and see that they fit well at the shoulders, crotch, and waist. If they are too short, that is not a problem as you're turning them into shorts anyway.;
, Mark them to where you would like your shorts to fall. Take off the overalls.

, This is where you will cut the shorts. It's much better to run on the long side than the short side while making these - you can always cut off more.

, Note that measurement. Measure the outer seam of the same leg and mark it at the same measurement as the mark on the inseam. Make a line and cut the leg.

, Line up the legs and cut off the extra on the other pant leg.

, If you desire to have the overalls be a lighter color, put the cut overalls in a large plastic tub. Fill halfway with water. Add about a cup of bleach. Let sit until desired color is reached (anywhere from 2 hours to overnight). Rinse the overalls. Put them in the washer on spin cycle and finally dry them in the dryer.

, If you desire the mellow, stained look some jeans have, fill a large tub halfway with hot water. Add one cup of coffee grounds and stir until you have a deep brown liquid (more coffee grounds can be added if you desire a darker color). Add the cut overalls and let sit overnight. Rinse the overalls. Put them in the washer on spin cycle and finally dry them in the dryer.

, Remember how you cut them a bit too long? To get a finished look, roll the ends of the shorts up twice back to your desired length. To achieve a frayed look, use a dull knife and pull the threads at the ends of the shorts and cut the really long threads off (be sure to take them off first!).

, Rhinestones can be glued on. Acrylic paints are permanent. Fabric paint designs can be added. Cool patches can brighten them up. Have fun with them!

You can find all of these things at any fabric store. You'll also need scissors, pins, a sewing machine or a needle and thread, a tape measure., You'll want cut them longer than they'll be in the end, because you'll be making them adjustable with the buckles.To make sure you don't cut your elastic lengths too short, measure yourself first. Hold one end of your measuring tape to one side of your waist.
Have someone pull the tape across your shoulder and back down to the same place on your waist on your backside.
Add 6"" to 12"" to this measurement to make the suspenders adjustable. This should be how long your elastic straps should be cut.

, Hold the two pieces of elastic at the belt line (where they will be clipped on to the waistband).

, Have someone help you bring the other ends of the elastic straps over your shoulders.

, Have someone hold the two ends of the straps to your belt line in the back. Each end should go to the opposite sides so that they cross over each other. The two strips will form an “X"" across the small of your back.


Once you've done this, take the elastic straps off and proceed with attaching the clips and buckles.

, Start from the bottom of the buckle and pull up, then down through the other side. Have the elastic extending about 1/4"" out of the buckle., Fold the end of the elastic sticking out 1/4"" from the buckle back through the buckle. Then stitch the elastic in place., Put the end of the elastic through the hook and fold it over so that it slightly overlaps the rest of the elastic. The front of the suspender clip should be on the opposite side.

, Take the end of the elastic that's open and pull it through the buckle. Insert it through the bottom and then back through the other side.This will make the suspenders adjustable.

, Put the end of the elastic through the hook and fold it over so that it slightly overlaps the rest of the elastic. The front of the suspender clip should be on the opposite side.

, Take a pin and pin it through the elastic where it's folded over on itself. This will keep the elastic in place while you sew., Use your sewing machine or needle and thread to sew the elastic in place. Be sure to back stitch a few times on both ends—this stitching will hold the clips onto the suspenders., For the other elastic and suspender clips, repeat the same process. Now you have your two suspender straps.

, Put on a pair of pants that fit you well. Then attach the two lengths of elastic to the back of the pants using the clips., Bring each strap up and over each shoulder, forming an “X” in the back.

, Pull the straps over your shoulders and to the front. Attach the front clips to your pants.

, Have someone help you pin the two elastic straps together where they meet in the back. This will hold the crisscross in place so you can sew it together., Take off the suspenders first by undoing all the clips. Use your sewing machine or a needle and thread to sew a diamond of stitches where the suspenders overlap, securing the ""X"" shape. You'll need about 5 stitches in each direction., For suspenders that meet in the back with a D or O shaped ring, you'll need: 2-4 yards of 1"" thick elastic (depending on your height and weight), one d-ring or o-ring, three suspender clips, thread, a needle, and scissors. Most of this can be bought at any craft store. A d-ring or o-ring can be bought at a hardware store if you cannot find it at a fabric or craft store..

, First, you'll make the back piece. Start by running one of the suspender clips about an inch up one end of the elastic. Fold the end back through the clip and then sew it in place.


Sew about five stitches. You can reinforce the seam by going back through a few times if you'd like.

, Next, you'll want to cut the elastic about a foot up from the suspender clip. Then wrap about an inch of the open end of the elastic through the d-ring and sew it in place.


Sew about five stitches. You can reinforce the seam by going back through a few times if you'd like.
Remember to make the folded over end on the right side, the same side as the back of the suspender clip.

, Cut two equal length strips of elastic that are as long as the length of your torso plus half the length of your torso. Slide the clips about one inch down the elastic straps. Fold the ends over and sew them in place.

, You'll need a friend to help you measure how much of the strap to cut off.


Attach the back suspender clip to the back of your pants and have a friend hold the d-ring in place in the middle of your back.
Attach the two front clips to the front of your pants. Have your friend pull the straps back over your shoulders and to the d-ring. Mark where the front straps meet the ring.
Cut the front straps an inch or two away from the mark, to give it some slack.

, Pull an inch of the open ends of the two front straps through the top of the d-ring. Sew each of them in place.Sew about five stitches. You can reinforce the seam by going back through a few times if you'd like.

Rip out the old hem.,
Put on the pants with matching shoes.,
Cuff the pants at the correct length.,
Remove the pants and turn them inside-out.",How to Hem a Pair of Pants1," Use a seam-ripper to take out the stitching that holds the old hem in place. Insert the seam ripper under the stitches and break the thread, pulling it out as you go. Continue until the hem is completely ripped out from both pant legs.









If you don't have a seam ripper you can use a small, sharp knife or a pair of nail scissors to do the job.
Be careful not to catch the fabric of your pants as you rip the stitches out.;
, To find the right length for your pants, try them on with the shoes you will most likely wear them with. Even flat shoes have a little more height than your bare feet, so it's important to try on your pants with shoes.









Try on jeans with sneakers or flats if that's what you plan to wear with them.
Dress pants should be worn with heels of the appropriate height.

, Fold the edges of the pant legs under to the length that falls at the right place over the top of your shoes. The cuffs should lightly graze your shoes, rather than hovering above them or bunching up around them.









Place several straight pins around the cuffs to secure them in place.
Walk around the room to determine whether the pants seem like they are cuffed at the right length. Check yourself out in the mirror. Do they ride up and swing? Do they catch on the back of your heels? Make adjustments as necessary.

, Make sure the pins stay in place so you know exactly how short to hem the pants. They are now ready to be sewed.

Measure the cuffs.,
Iron the cuffs.,
Measure 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) from the ironed hemline.,
Remove the pins and cut the fabric along the chalked line.,
Sew the hems.,
Try on the pants.",How to Hem a Pair of Pants2," Use a ruler or a measuring tape to measure the distance from the edge of the pant legs to the hemline fold. Make sure both pant legs are cuffed to the exact same length. Use several more straight pins to hold both cuffs in place.








, Use a hot iron (on the right setting for your pants' fabric) to make a crease at the fold where the pants are cuffed. Take your time and make sure the crease you make is straight.









At this point you may carefully try on the pants once more to ensure that the hem will fall exactly where you want it. Take care not to prick yourself with the straight pins.

, This is where you will make a cut to remove extra fabric from the pants before sewing the hem. Use chalk or a marking pencil to make a mark 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the hemline around the entire pant leg. Repeat on the other side.








, Use pinking shears, rather than fabric scissors, to make the cut. Pinking shears are designed to cut fabric in such a way that it doesn't become unraveled. Repeat with the other pant leg.









Take your time trimming the fabric. Make sure you don't accidentally dip too close to the hemline.
When you're finished trimming, use straight pins to pin the fabric back in place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the hemline.

, Thread a needle with thread that matches the color of your pants. Use a blind stitch to sew around the pant leg about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the hem. Continue until you reach the place where you started, then knot the thread and use a scissors to cut it. Repeat with the other pant leg.









This process can also be completed using a sewing machine.
To make sure the hem is nearly invisible from the outside of the pants, pick up only one or two fibers at a time on that side of the fabric.

, Turn them right-side out and iron the hemline once more. Try them on with the pair of shoes you plan to wear with them. Make sure the cuffs look even and drop to the right length. If they need adjustment, rip out the seams and start over.

Try on the pants.",How to Hem a Pair of Pants3," Use a ruler or a measuring tape to make sure both pant legs will be hemmed to the same length.








, Use chalk or a marking pencil to make a mark 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the hemline around the entire pant leg, then trim the excess fabric with pinking shears. Repeat on the other side.








, Cut a length of fusible tape and remove the paper backing. Line up the edge of the tape with the crease in the fabric that you ironed. Press the tape down and continue lining it up and applying it around the entire pant leg. Cut more tape if you run out as you go, and fold the cuff back over the tape when you're finished. Repeat with the other pant leg.









If you don't have fusible tape, hem tape and other temporary hemming products can be used in its place. These usually fall out after a wash or two.
Make sure the tape is completely straight around the bottom of both pant legs.

, Place a thin cloth over the cuffed fabric. Heat up an iron and apply it to the cloth for several seconds. Remove the cloth and continue ironing the fabric underneath. Use this procedure to fuse the tape with the fabric around the entire pant leg, then repeat with the second pant leg.









After you've ironed a section, lift the cuff gently to make sure that the tape has fused with the fabric to hold the hem in place before moving on.
Make sure your iron is set to a heat that won't damage the fabric of your pants.

, Turn the pants right-side out and try them on. If you aren't happy with the length, launder the pants and run them through the dryer until the tape falls out, then hem them again.

To make the pattern, cut three 11-x 3.5″ pieces from your printer paper.,
Take one strip of paper and use your ruler to mark off 1.25″ from the left side and then 1.25″ from the right side (the second mark should be at the 2.25″ mark on the ruler) along the narrow edge, as shown.

,
Measure down each side 2″ and make a mark.

,
Draw lines to connect the marks, as shown, to form a point.

,
Cut along the two marked lines.

,
Complete your pattern by taping two non-pointed 11″ strips of paper together and then tape your pointed strip into place on one end.,
Before placing your pattern to cut the fabric, you should iron the fabric.,
Fold your fabric so that the “right sides” face each other, place the pattern piece, and pin it in place.,
Cut along your pattern through both fabric thicknesses.

,
Repeat steps eight and nine to create the pieces for your second wrap.

,
Your fabric pieces should already be lined up and facing each other “wrong side out.” Make sure the ends line up and then pin them in place.

,
Using a straight stitch, stitch all the way around each set of pieces, but make sure to leave the top point open, as shown.,
Clip the two bottom corners on each wrap to remove excess fabric.,
Turn the wraps right side out by pulling the fabric out through the open point.

,
Iron the turned wraps, making sure to turn under and press the unfinished edges along the open point.

,
Cut your tie material so you have two pieces that are each approximately 16-17″ long.,
Insert a tie end through the open hole and pin it in place so that it is running down the point’s middle and ends just below the “shoulders” of the wrap.,
Carefully stitch straight across from shoulder to shoulder, stitching the tie’s end in place in the process, on each wrap.

,
Starting at the point end, stitch all the way down the middle of each wrap.

,
Measure 18″ up from the flat end of each wrap and mark it on both sides with a pin.

,
Straight stitch from one pin, down along the flat edge, and up to the other pin.,
Change your machine to a zigzag stitch and use this stitch to top stitch where you have not straight stitched.,
Iron your wraps one last time and you are ready to go!",How to Make Wrist Wraps," You could make four pieces from the two sheets, but you only need three.;
,,,,, It is easiest to do this if you overlap the paper very slightly and then tape it in place on both sides. You are finished with your pattern!

, I always iron fabric before cutting anything out because it makes the pieces more exact and the finished product better.

, If your fabric has a distinct directional design, make sure your pattern is placed straight along the design instead of at a funny angle that will make the wraps look sideways.

,,,, I like to stitch about 1/4″ away from the fabric’s edges. If you take in commercial seam allowances of 5/8″ using the pattern you just made, the wraps will be too narrow.

, This allows the finished wraps to have crisper points without awkward lumps.

,,, If you are using twill tape, you can simply knot one end of each tie to prevent the whole tie from fraying. I like to use paracord for my ties. I strip the inner white strands to use just the outer sheet and melt each end with a lighter to prevent unraveling.

, Repeat for the second wrap.

,,,, Stitch no more than 1/4″ away from the edge and try to keep the spacing as consistent as possible. Repeat on the other wrap.

, In other words, the zigzag should go up and around the point, then back down the other side to meet the straight stitching. Overlap the zigzag with the straight stitch slightly, but about 1/2″ or so. Repeat on the second wrap.

,


These wraps are very easy to wear – just wrap one around your wrist, then wrap the tie around your wrist, tuck the tie underneath itself, and twist slightly to tighten or loosen.

Start out with plain old T-shirts.,
Consider iron on transfers.,
Pay attention to iron on transfer materials.,
Printer and a household iron.",How to Make Matching Clothes for Couples," There are usually 2 options, purchasing new blank T-shirts or use the old T-shirts. It goes without saying purchasing blank T-Shirts is ideal first option. As for old T-shirts, more room left to decorate, the better. If there is no much room, what we can do is to decorate in a small space, which will make difference, too to some extent.;
, Iron on transfers for letter and number or cherished moment. Every couple T-shirt has its themes, such as love words (like “love you forever”), a sign (like two hearts impaled by an arrow or a picture two T-shirts make up only when you two are together), or unforgettable moment you take a picture when you are going out. About their font, we can search online or design our own with design software.

, Now there are various iron-on transfers in the market. And each has its own features and results. Without taking it into consideration will result into a different T-shirt. Eco-solvent heat transfers are becoming the new favorite of DIYers because the innovative matte digital media is perfect for printing high quality, full-color custom graphics. It has excellent stretch and rebound properties, great durability and opacity, and will not crack or come off. It is printed by eco-solvent ink and specially made for both light and dark garments including all fabric.

, Each iron on transfer gets its own suitable printer, like inkjet printer for inkjet heat transfers, laser printer for laser heat transfer paper, eco-solve inkjet printer for eco solvent heat transfers. And when it comes to iron on transfers, a household or heat press machine cannot be neglected, too.

",How to Make a Silk Scarf," The best silk fabrics are usually light Georgette, organza and crepes. The best designs and widest variety can be found in privately owned fabric stores, but keep your eyes open. You might find a piece when you least expect it. Burned out velvet's and even crisp fabrics can be used for scarves, especially for wearing with an outdoor coat.;
, Silk is commonly sold in 36"", 45"" and 60"" widths. So, if you want a square scarf you would ask the salesperson to cut the same length as the width: 36"" x 36"", 45"" x 45"", 60"" x 60"". Your finished size would be 35 1/2"" by 35 1/2"", etc.









If you want a rectangular scarf, you have more choice. Some people think a 72"" length looks best when you wear a suit. Left loose, that length of scarf starts at one hem of a jacket, follows the neckline and then falls to the other hem of the jacket. For variety, tie a long scarf into a big floppy bow or give it a loose, low knot and wear a simple, single color blouse underneath. You can try various lengths, using a measuring tape, to find the one that suits you best or select the scarves you love best and take the measure from them.
You have more choice in the width of a scarf, because you can crumple or fold the fabric or even wash the fabric in very hot water to take some of the body out of the fabric so that it hangs gracefully. You can make two rectangular scarves when you purchase a 72"" length of 36"" or 45"". One scarf to keep and one to give to a friend or family member.

, This leads to a straighter edge for the hems. However, ripping can cause soft, loosely woven fabrics to stretch out of shape. If you can't iron the edge straight and outstretched again after ripping, the scarf hems will be troublesome to sew.








, Some people are good at hand rolling a hem as they sew. Others prefer to iron them flat and then sew the two or four sides (if the fabric has a good design for it, you may choose not to hem the selvage sides on a square scarf.)

, Then, turn the fabric under again and iron the hem once more. If you water wash your scarves you can spray the fabric with distilled water and use steam when you iron the hems. Some people fear water spotting but water spotting was probably more common with inferior dyes in the last century.

, Some people use a rolling attachment on their sewing machine to hem their scarves. Others use a blind hemmer. And others sew scalloped edges, something that can be particularly effective with a soft silk fabric.

",How to Make Mittens from Old Sweaters," Place your hand onto a sheet of paper. Keep your fingers together and your thumb sticking out at an angle.Trace around your hand, leaving a 1-inch (1.27-centimeter) space around it.Don't make the base too narrow, or you will have troubles slipping the mitten on and off. Cut the pattern out when you are done.


Use regular scissors to cut the pattern, not your fabric scissors.
You are adding the extra space for wiggle room and seam allowance.
Keep your lines and curves smooth. You don't have to make the little bumps for the fingers. Think: basic mitten shape.;
, Place the sweater into a pillowcase. Wash it in the washing machine using hot water.Dry it in the dryer using a high temperature. Repeat this 3 to 4 times for best results.This will felt the wool, making it cozier and easier to work with.


The sweater will shrink. Don't worry, this is fine.
Choose a sweater that is at least 80 percent wool; 100 percent would be even better., Align the bottom, palm part of your pattern with the top edge of the ribbed hem. The ribbed hem will make a cuff around your wrists. This will make it easier to tuck your mittens into your coat while you are wearing them, and lock in the warmth.

, When you are done, flip the pattern over, pin it in place, then cut out the other mitten. This will give you a left and right mitten. When you are done, you should have four pieces.

, Flip the mitten pieces over. Pin them together with the right sides facing in and the wrong sides are facing out. You do not have to pin across the bottom edge.

, Use a small zigzag stitch and follow the lines that you drew. This will allow the fabric to stretch without snapping the thread.Backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing. Do not sew across the bottom edge.

, This will help reduce bulk and make the mittens more comfortable to wear.If you'd like, you can go over the edges with a small zigzag stitch.

, Tuck your hand into it and wiggle your fingers. This will help push out the seams and fill it out.

, You can decorate it with embroidery thread and buttons.Here are some ideas to get your started:


Use embroidery thread in a contrasting color to make a blanket stitch around the bottom hem of your mitten. Keep the stitches loose, or your mitten won't stretch.
Add simple embroidery to the top/front of each mitten.
Braid some yarn, then weave it around the wrist of your mitten to make a tie cord. Attach a matching pompom to each end of the cord.
Fold the cuff over to shorten it, then sew a wood or plastic button on top.

, Fold your lining in half. Pin the pattern ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the bottom edge of your lining. The lining will stop at the wrist. You are adding the extra ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) for the hem.


Great lining choices include: flannel, fleece, and jersey/t-shirt fabric. You can buy it from the fabric store, or reuse old shirts or blankets.

, When you are done, flip the pattern over, and cut out another set of lining pieces. You should have four pieces when you are done.

, Make sure that you are pinning the mittens with the right sides facing in and the wrong sides facing out.

, Use a simple straight stitch for this. Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing and to remove the pins as you sew. Do not sew across the bottom of the mittens.


If you are using jersey or t-shirt material, use a small zigzag stitch instead.

, Try to get them down to about ⅛ to ¼ inch (0.32 to 0.64 centimeter). This will help reduce bulk and make your mitten more comfortable to wear. For a neater finish, go back over the edges with a small zigzag stitch.

, Fold the bottom edges up by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) all the way around each mitten lining. Pin them in place.

, Use a simple straight stitch if you are using flannel or fleece, and a small zigzag stitch if you are using jersey or t-shirt material. If you wish to add an elastic, do the following:


Leave a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) gap in the hem.
Thread a piece of elastic through the gap with a safety pin.
Pull the elastic until the hem gathers slightly.
Cut the excess elastic, then stitch the ends together.
Tuck them into the gap. Sew the gap shut.

, Do not turn your lining inside out. This way, your lining will be smooth on the inside. The raw hems will be covered by the mittens.

, Set your lining down on the table with the matching mitten piece across from it, hems overlapping. Stitch the two thumbs together at the hems. Stitch the two finger pieces together at the top center, also at the hems. This will help keep the lining in place when you pull the gloves off.


Repeat this step for the other mitten and lining piece.

, Tuck your hand into the lining. Roll the mitten over your hand, like a sock. Adjust it until the seams match up and the fit is comfortable.

, If you added an elastic to the hem, keep the elastic pulled taut while you sew and use a larger zigzag stitch. Alternatively, you can stitch it by hand with a loose running stitch

, You can use a piece of string, ribbon or cord. Or, find anything that is similar and will hold together well when pulled and tied. A strip of flexible leather would work, or a thin rope like twine.

, They must be of exactly the same size, although the finished size of the purse or bag is entirely up to you. To reduce the amount of seeing, cut out a rectangular of fabric twice as deep as you want you finished bag to be. This way you only have to see the sides and not the bottom of the bag.

, Fold down about a centimetre of fabric at the top of your fabric to make a hem or channel. Do this to both pieces if you have two or on both sides if you have on piece you are folding in half. Pin the hem. Stitch along the hem at the bottom. Your drawstring will be passed through this hem when you bag is nearly finished. Use small, neat stitches as the will show when your bag is completed., Pin together both prices of fabric or fold your fabric. You can pin these together if it helps you but this is not essential. Stitch together along the sides and bottom, or stitch the two sides if you are using the folded fabric method. Ensure you leave the hemmed edge open for the drawstring opening. When stitched together, turn the bag out right side out.

, You now have a pouch. Next you'll add the drawstring element.

,, Get the string, ribbon or cord piece. Using a darning needle, thread your ribbon, yarn, twine or whatever into the hem or channel you sewed at the beginning. Your drawstring needs to be about twice as long as the opening of your bag. Make sure you don't pull it right the way through! You need some of the draw string on either side of your bag's opening. Once you have threaded the drawstring right the way through both hems, tie the two ends of the drawstring into a knot or bow.

, You can tie it closed.

, You've created a drawstring purse. It can be used for carrying your usual daily items, or it can hold things for storing or safekeeping.

1.,
Cut fabric into 45 x 5 inch strips.

,
Fold the strips in half length-wise with the patterned side out to form a 45 x 2.5 inch strip and press with hot iron.

,
Stitch down the length of the strip 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the open edge back stitching at both ends to make a tube.

,
Stitch one end of the tube closed (I stitched mine at a 45 degree angle for looks).

,
Using an unsharpened pencil, knitting needle or chopstick, turn the tube right-side-out.

,
Fold the tube in half and mark the half-way point.,
At the mark closest to the closed end of the tube, stitch across the width of the tube.

You can even use two different fabrics if you’d like to make a reversible cravat. Popular fabric choices include:Satin
Soft cotton
Muslin
Silk;
, For this project, you will need some pins, a sewing machine, thread, scissors, a steam iron and ironing board, a measuring tape, a flat work area (such as a table), pattern paper and a pencil, a pattern pencil or chalk, and two strips of fabric that are at least 9 inches (23 cm) wide and about 2.2 yards (2 meters) long.To make a cravat that only wraps once around your neck, the fabric can be only 1.6 yards (1.5 meters).
If you don’t have access to a sewing machine, you can hand stitch the cravat, meaning you’ll need a sewing needle instead.

, Whatever that measurement is, subtract one-half inch (1.3 cm), and divide that in half. Write this measurement down, as you will need it in the next step to create your pattern.


To make a generic or one-size cravat, use eight or nine inches as your measurement., Draw a rectangle that’s 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) wide and the correct length based on the neck measurement from the previous step.


Now, connect that rectangle to an elongated hexagon that’s 7 inches (17.8 cm) wide,and between 21 and 31 inches (53 to 78.8 cm) long, depending on how long you want your cravat to be.
Make sure the center of the original rectangle connects with the lengthwise center of the hexagon.
When you are finished, cut out the pattern.

, Take both your strips of fabric and fold them in half widthwise. With the folds together, lay them out on a flat surface. Place the pattern on top of the fabric, and position the very top of the neckband along the straight folds of the fabric.


Pin the pattern in place, making sure to go through all four layers of fabric.

, Use your chalk or fabric pencil to draw the pattern out on the fabric. Carefully remove the pattern and replace the pins to hold the fabric in place. Cut out the two pieces of your cravat.

, Open the folds so that your two cravat pieces open up. Lay them out on a flat surface with the good sides of the fabric pieces facing inward (facing each other). Pin the edges together.

, Be sure to leave the bottom triangle open so that you can turn the cravat right side out when you are finished. Make sure you back stitch at the beginning and end.


Use a one-quarter to one-half inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) seam allowance.

, Anywhere there is a corner on the cravat, make a notch with a single snip in the fabric that bisects the angle of the corner. This will help create cleaner edges. Make sure you stop before cutting the seam.

, When you have pulled the right sides of the fabric through, carefully press the edges around the entire cravat.


Be sure to use the correct iron setting.

, Use your iron to press up the open fabric ends, following the same one-quarter to one-half inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) seam allowance. Pin the edges together, and either top stitch the bottom or use a needle and thread to create a blind stitch.

, You want both ends hanging down on your chest. Adjust the cravat so the right is slightly longer than the left. Bring the right side across the top of the left side.

, The left and right sides should now be back on their original side, but the right side is now wrapped around the left.

, Wrap the right side around the back, and then pull the right side up through the center of the neck band.

, Fold the fabric over the top of the neckband so it hangs down the front center of your chest. Tuck the extra fabric into the opening of your collared shirt., Follow the same procedure as for the casual cravat, but instead of tucking the excess fabric into your shirt, tuck it into your vest.


If you like, use a cravat pin to keep the top layer of fabric in place.

, Take the fabric that you pulled up and over the neck band, and tuck it into the fabric loops that you created by wrapping the cravat. Adjust the knot and tuck the excess fabric into your shirt or vest."

Done.",How to Sew a Simple Fabric Bag for Beginners2," The fabric should be strong enough to carry items and to be used on a regular basis. If you want to use flimsier fabric, you'll need lining fabric as well, which adds to the complexity of making the bag, so only do this if it's really necessary.

, Double this measurement and draw it onto the piece of fabric you're going to use (use a fabric marker). The shape should be either a rectangle or a square.

,


If using lining as well, you'll need to cut this out at the same time.

, The fold now becomes the base of the bag and it's already ready for stitching together.


If using lining, place it on the fabric's wrong side before folding. Pin in place, then stitch onto the fabric, all the way around. Then fold the whole piece, lining side facing outward.

, Stitch from the base end of the bag to the end of each side. Leave the top portion unstitched; this becomes the bag's opening.

, Stitch this folded edge in place, neatly, taking care to not catch the other side of the bag (the bag opening must stay open). This folded portion creates a neat and stronger edge for the bag.

, You now have the base section of the bag. All you need to do now is add handles.

, To keep things simple, prefer one strap only for the bag. Decide on the length of the strap, remember that when it's over your should, the length halves. Cut out a strip of the same fabric to the measurement you've made. The width of this should be about 4 inches/10cm.


If lining the strap, cut the lining to the same measurements, then stitch or glue the lining to the wrong side of the strap fabric before proceeding with the next step.
Fold the strap piece in half, right side facing out. Stitch the joined section together.
Stitch one end of the strap to one end of the bag's opening. Repeat for the other end of the strap, on the opposite side of the bag.

One 9in wide strip across the width of the fabric.
Cross-cut to give 24 1 1⁄2 x 9in rectangles for the design panel.;
, Take the two fat quarters and place them right sides together on your cutting mat. Keeping them together, fold in half width wise. Making sure you cut through all four layers, cut 12 1 1⁄2in wide strips.
, From the fusible wadding, cut the following:

One 8 x 24in rectangle for the design panel
One 4 x 8in rectangle for the base
Two 2 x 24in strips for the bag top section.

, From the lining, cut the following:

One 8 1⁄2 x 25in rectangle
Two 5 x 9in rectangles
If you are using a fat quarter, cut two 81⁄2 x 13in rectangles and join with a 1⁄2in seam to make a 81⁄2 x 25in rectangle.

, Take the 9 x 24in piece of medium weight interfacing and using a soft pencil, draw 23 lines at 1in intervals. See Figure 2.
, Take each of the 12 pairs of contrast strips cut from the fat quarters and, keeping each pair right sides together, join them lengthwise. Press the seam open and then fold the piece along the stitching line so that the right sides are to the outside. Cut each piece in half to yield two pieces each 1 1⁄4 x 9in.
, Take one strip of background fabric and place it, right side up, onto the marked interfacing so that the edge of the strip lies along the first marked line. The strip will have a 1⁄2in seam allowance overhanging the bottom edge of the interfacing. See Figure 4.




, Take a stitched double contrast strip and place on top of the background strip, matching the raw edges. A 1⁄4in of the background fabric will show underneath the stitched edge of the double strip. Stitch through all layers 1⁄4in from the raw edges. See Figure 5.










, Place a second background strip right side down directly on top of the contrast strip. Stitch again through all layers 1⁄4in from the raw edges. Turn this second strip over to the right side and finger press in place; the contrast strip will form a lose flap. You can combine steps 7 and 8 and stitch all the layers together in one operation., Repeat steps 7 and 8 until all 24 strips are stitched onto the interfacing with a background strip under each double contrast strip. See Figures 5–6., Fuse the 8 x 24in rectangle of wadding onto the back of the panel, matching the two short edges and leaving a 1⁄2in gap down each long edge., Turn the panel to the right side and stitch the strips in place with matching thread along the centre of the work, pushing all the strips in the same direction, with the first contrast fabric on top.
, Working along one edge of the work, fold the edges of the strips so that the contrast fabric is visible and pin in place. Take care not to pull the pieces tight or the shape of your work will be distorted. Do not fold the last strip as yet, just pin in place.
, Stitch the folded edges in place with matching thread so that the stitching passes through the points. Repeat with the opposite edge of the piece. Trim the long edges to a scant 1⁄4 inch (10.2 cm) from the stitched line, making sure that the last strip is just pinned in place. The piece should measure 81⁄2in wide.
, The wadding should butt together to avoid a bulky join. Fold and stitch both ends of the last strip in place., Iron the 4 x 8in piece of fusible wadding onto the wrong side of the base fabric, leaving 1⁄4in all round. Secure the base with simple quilting (optional) and mark the centre of each side of the base with a pin.
, Mark the lower edge of the design panel in four equal sections, beginning at the seam. Position the join in the panel to the centre of one of the short sides of the base. Right sides together, pin the base to the design panel, easing the panel to fit the base. Stitch together with a 1⁄4in seam, clipping the edges of the design panel at the corners of the base. Again, the edges of the wadding should butt together to avoid a bulky join.
, Press the two 2 x 24in strips of fusible wadding onto the wrong side of the 5 x 25in bag top section, leaving a 1⁄8in gap between the two pieces and 1⁄2in all the way round. Right sides together, fold in half and stitch with a 1⁄2in seam; press open.
, Take the 2 1/2x32in strips. Wrong sides together, press each long strip in half. Open up and bring the side edges to the centre and refold along the crease line. This will give you four thicknesses of fabric. Beginning 2 1⁄2in from the top end, stitch down the long (open double fold) side close to the edge, finishing 2 1⁄2in from the bottom end.




, Cut two pieces of piping cord each 27in long (It’s a good idea to wrap clear sticky tape around each cut end to prevent fraying). Attach a safety pin to one end and thread through the handle tube, leaving 21⁄2in of unstitched fabric only at each end.
, Take the 4 x 6in pieces of fabric and fusible interfacing: fuse the interfacing to the wrong side., Mark a point at the end of one short side and draw diagonal lines to it from the sides to form the tab point. Stitch with a 1⁄4in seam along the dotted lines. Trim away the excess fabric and the bulk from the points. Turn through to the right side, press and top stitch close to the edge around three finished sides. Work a buttonhole at the point.




, Position both ends of one handle onto the top edge of one side (right side) of the design panel with right sides together and the handles an equal distance from the centre. Stitch in place 1⁄4in from the edge. Right sides together, stitch the fastening tab in the centre. See Figure 16.

, Pin the top bag section to the top edge of the bag, right sides together and matching the joins in both pieces. Using a 1⁄4in seam, stitch all round the top of the bag; press so that the edges of the wadding butt together to avoid a bulky join.
,, Place the template plastic between the two 5 x 9in lining pieces so that the right sides of the fabric are outside. Stitch all round, close the edge of the plastic. You may need to use the zipper foot to stitch close to the edge.
, Stitch the seam in two parts. Sew 1⁄2in along the seam, leave a 5in gap and then continue sewing to the end., Position the join to the centre of one of the short sides of the base. Stitch together with a 1⁄2in seam, clipping the edges of the lining at the corners of the base., Make sure that the top edges are in line, that vertical seams are matching and that the handles and straps are tucked inside. Stitch around the top edge with a 1⁄2in seam. Turn the bag right side out through the gap in the lining. Slipstitch the lining closed., Make sure that the lining is in place. Quilt four horizontal rows 1⁄2in apart through all layers of the top section, including the lower part of the handles and the tab.,"

You can choose whatever kind of fabric you prefer, though cotton muslin is an affordable option that will hold up well to wear and tear. Try to avoid fabrics that might be itchy against your skin.When choosing a pre-patterned material, select one you think would look good as a bandana, like a paisley design, a checked pattern, a skull and crossbones theme, and so on.
In some parts of the world, wearing a certain color bandana can be associated with a local gang. For example, blue and red bandannas are tied to gangs in the US city of Los Angeles. It can be dangerous to accidentally identify yourself with a gang, so be wary of this when choosing a bandana color or pattern.;
, You may want to use a straight edge, like a ruler or meter stick, but you can also follow straight lines in pre-patterned material. You square should be about 2' (61 cm) long on each side, though you can make it larger or smaller according to your size.









It may be easiest for you to start your square in the corner of your material. This way, less of the cloth ends up as scraps.
A felt-tip pen will show up more easily than pencil markings. A clear line will make it easier for you to cut your material in a straight line.
A washable fabric marker is also a good choice for sketching out your square. When you wash your finished bandana, any stray marks will wash out.The sketch doesn't have to be perfect, but straight lines will result in your bandana being regular in shape and polished in appearance.
It's best to make your bandana larger than too small. It's much easier to trim fabric off than it is to add fabric on.

, If you're using a material mostly made up of cotton, it may be easiest to make the first cut with a pair of sharp scissors or fabric scissors. Since cotton rips fairly easily, you may be able to rip it along the rest of it along the line you have drawn.








If you are unsure of the blend of fabric used in your material, to prevent waste, you may want to use your scissors to completely cut your square free.
Even with pure cotton fabrics, sometimes the tear will not be clean. If you are working with a limited amount of fabric, using scissors may be the safest bet.

, At this point, you may want to try on your bandana to see how it fits. If it is too large, you can trim it down, but you should keep in mind that you'll likely lose ½"" - 2"" (1¼ - 5 cm) of fabric to hemming.








Hemming your bandana will keep it from fraying at the edges. An unhemmed raw edge can fray easily., A larger hem will be easiest to work with, but will create a wide doubled fold along the edge of your fabric. For your bandana, you may want to start with a medium hem, which is usually about 2"" (5 cm) in length. This will be folded under the cloth and stitched down to prevent fraying.









A hem can be any size you choose. You may find you like the extra thickness of the folded cloth around the edges of a longer hem, or a narrow, short hem., You'll want your cloth to be crisp and straight when stitching to prevent a crooked hem, so you'll need to iron the cloth you fold. For a medium hem, fold ½"" (1¼ cm) of cloth beneath your fabric and press it with an iron. Then fold another 1½"" (3.8 cm) of cloth in the same fashion and press it again.









For larger hems, first fold and press ¾"" (1.9 cm) of cloth under your fabric. Follow this with a 1¼"" (3.2 cm) under fold of fabric and press again.
Small hems can be made by first folding ¼"" (.64 cm) of your edge under your fabric and pressing. Then fold under another ¼"" (.64 cm) and press again., Make sure your now double folded edge is straight and neat. You may need to adjust the fabric and repress it to correct crookedness. Once your soon to be hemmed edge is aligned, pin the fabric so it stays in place when you are sewing.









You may want to use a straight edge, like a ruler or meter stick, to check the evenness of your folded edge., The easiest way of doing this is with a sewing machine, but if this isn't an option a needle and thread work just as well. Thread your needle and poke it through all the layers of your folded over fabric from the fabric's reverse side so the knot is hidden. Then feed the needle back and forth through the back and front of your fabric along your folded over edge at regular intervals. When you reach the end, tie off your thread with a knot.









When you thread your needle, double the thread so that your stitching holds up to wear and tear better.
A very professional looking stitch you might want to use is called a slip stitch. This kind of stitch will be invisible once you're finished, though it may take some practice before you get the hang of it.You may also want to check out how to hem to learn the finer points of hemming.
If hemming with a needle and thread seems a little daunting, you could try using iron on hem tape. This can be found at most craft and sewing stores, or at general retailers like Walmart and Target.

, There are many different ways you can wear your new bandana. Experiment to see which one suits your style best. Two popular styles you might consider:


Wear your bandana around your neck so that it hangs in a triangular  shape at the base of your neck.
Fold your bandana into a long, narrow strip. Then wrap the strip around your head and tie it at the back to wear it like a headband., Depending on how you choose to wear your bandana, the best location for your decorations will vary. For example, if you plan on wearing your bandana along your neck in a triangular shape, you'll likely want your design with its bottom pointed towards the corner and located in the corner of the fabric.


It may help to put on your bandana and take a look at it in a mirror. Then you can mark the fabric with a pencil or washable fabric marker on the spot that best presents your decoration.

, A patch is a great way of representing your favorite bands, games, sports teams, and more. Some of these are heat activated and can be attached to your bandana with an iron, while others may require stitching to be held in place.









Your local fabric store may be a good place to look for patches, but for specific designs, an online retailer might provide the best selection.
Some fabrics or blends may not be safe to iron. Be sure to check the fabric information before attempting to iron on a patch., By using fabric paint, you can create designs that are unique and significant to you. In some cases, you may need painting supplies, like a brush and water, but some fabric paints come in marker applicators.Many general retailers, art retailers, and craft stores have assorted fabric paints you can choose from. Be sure you choose one that won't come out in the wash!
You may want to use a fabric stencil so that your finished painted designs look more professional.

, Fabric markers may be a little more familiar and easy to use than paint, especially if you don't have much painting experience. For the best finished product, you may want to first draw your design in a washable fabric marker, then follow this with your wash-safe markers.








Depending on your fabric, you may also be able to use a pencil to sketch out your designs before using a more permanent medium.

, For best results, you should always follow the directions on the products you use for decorating your bandana. Fabric paints and markers may need some time to dry before washing, or may have special washing instructions.

Cut the ends of the thread.",How to Sew a Patch on a Uniform1," If it’s a new uniform, make sure to wash and dry once before sewing on the patch, otherwise, the fabric will bunch unevenly under the patch after the first wash and dry cycle.









Many uniforms are made out of cotton. Cotton will usually shrink somewhat after the first wash. If you sew a patch onto your uniform before it has been washed then the fabric under the patch will shrink and pull your patch, bunching it.
It is also a good idea to iron the area where the patch is to be placed before starting to sew. Ironing the area will remove any wrinkles. If you sew your patch over wrinkles then your uniform will be permanently wrinkled.;
, Choose a thread that is either the color of the uniform or the color of the edge of the patch.


If you can’t find thread that’s the same color as either, look for a darker color that’s as close as possible.
Darker rather than lighter thread will blend better and not show up as blatantly. You can also get clear thread to make it less visible.

, Some patches such as those on military uniforms need to be placed in a specific area.


For example, if you need to sew on an American flag patch you need to place it on the shoulder/bicep area of the sleeve. The flag also needs to be placed so it’s facing the right direction. The American flag should always be positioned so that when the wearer is moving forward, it gives the flag the effect of waving in the wind, moving forward. Check with your superiors to make sure you are placing patches in the correct places.

, This is to check if it is positioned correctly. it can help to have someone else confirm this with you.


Be careful when wearing your uniform with pins holding the patch. Carefully put the uniform on so the pins don’t poke you.
The reason you may want to check how it fits is because when wearing your uniform your body will fill out the garment. This could affect how the patch looks.

, Use a safety pin or straight pin to hold the patch in place. Or, alternatively, use adhesive fabric tape to iron the patch on.









Even if you don’t have an iron on patch, you might want to get some adhesive ironing tape. The adhesive tape is usually better than pins because it sticks the patch in place while you sew. You won’t have to worry about sewing around pins and poking yourself.
Cut and place the tape. Place the patch on the tape and iron.
If you don’t iron the patch, you’ll have to pin the patch in place.

, If you're not very familiar with sewing, you may want to start with a piece of thread no longer than 18 inches (45cm). Longer pieces tend to get tangled and are harder to work with than shorter ones.









Alternatively, you can try not cutting the thread and leaving it on the spool. This will help prevent the thread from getting tangled as well.
Additionally, you won’t have to worry about running out of thread and re-threading your needle.

, Threading the needle can be difficult. If you have a needle threading tool, use it to save you time.









If you don’t have a threading tool, it can help to twist and wet the thread in your mouth. your saliva will serve as a temporary adhesive to hold the tiny strands of thread together. This allows you to better thread the eye of the needle.

, Start on the inside of your garment and poke the needle out, coming up through the patch.









You’ll want to start on the inside of your fabric so that the knot you’ll create to hold the thread in place isn’t showing on the outside. Start inside and poke the needle out.

, Run the needle back through the uniform about 1/4” (6mm) from where you brought it out.









For patches, a straight stitch is not only the easiest but the quickest way to sew the patch on. You don’t need a complicated stitching pattern, especially if you ironed on your patch.
A straight stitch will also be the least visible.

, Continue your straight stitch until you’ve gone all the way around your patch. You should end where you started.









When hand sewing a patch onto a uniform it’s important to take your time and do your best to make sure that your weaves and the length of your stitches are as even to one another as possible. Keeping an even pattern will make your patch look much better.

, When you have sewn all the way around the edge of the patch, loop the thread and pull the needle through to tie off your knot.









To complete sewing your patch, thread your needle through so that you create a small loop on the inside of your uniform. Bring the needle through the loop and pull the thread tight. This will create a tight knot.

, Cut any loose threads that are hanging beyond the knot.









You should leave a little thread about 1/2” (1cm) long. Leaving just a bit ensures that you don’t accidentally cut the knots. Tuck the thread under the patch.

Start sewing.",How to Sew a Patch on a Uniform2," Before sewing, you will want to iron your uniform to smooth out any wrinkles.









Ironing your garment before sewing will prevent you from sewing over any wrinkles and leaving permanent wrinkles in your clothes.

, It’s smart to place your patch on your garment or uniform and make sure it’s in the correct spot before sewing.









If you sew your patch onto your uniform and realize you have put it in the wrong place you’ll have to remove the patch and start all over again.

, Even if you don’t have an iron on patch, you might want to get some adhesive ironing tape. 








Cut and place the tape. Place the patch on the tape and iron.
If you don’t iron the patch, you’ll have to pin the patch in place. Pinning your patch will create more work for you when using your machine.

, Set up your machine so that your needle length is shorter for the patch. Set the machine to a straight stitch. And place your presser foot in the up position.








different sewing machines will have different features and capabilities. It’s best to refer to your manual to get best results.
Make sure that you are only sewing the patch onto one piece of fabric. If you have to sew your patch onto a sleeve this can be tricky. Pull back the other side of the sleeve without the patch so you don’t sew your sleeve shut.

, Place the thread on the bobbin. Your manual will have instructions on how to correctly do this. In general, bring your thread through your bobbin which is on the spindle. With the spindle so that it winds the thread around the bobbin. Press the foot peddle to fill the bobbin.








Once the bobbin is filled you’ll have to place the bobbin in the correct location depending on your machine. Then run the thread through the proper parts of your machine to attach it to the needle. Each machine has a different process for this. Refer to your manual. Make sure you have the correct color thread in place. You should either use thread that’s the color of the patch or clear thread.

,









Your sewing machine will most likely have different speed settings. The speed dictates how quickly the needle moves. You’ll want to keep it low so that you have good control when sewing.

, Press down on your foot pedal to engage the needle and slowly move your garment until you’ve completed sewing the patch.








To rotate the garment and patch, move both as one. Make sure that the foot of the sewing machine is up, but the needle is in place.
When you need to rotate, you need to lift the foot up so that you can move the garment. But keep the needle in place so that you get a consistent pattern.
Once you’ve made it all the way around your patch, seal the stitch.
Take your scissors and cut away any loose threads. You should leave a little bit of thread about 1/2” (1cm) long. Leaving just a bit ensures that you don’t accidentally cut the knots.

Go slowly.,
Seal your thread with a not or on the machine.",How to Sew a Patch on a Uniform3," If you need to replace a patch because you’ve been promoted you’ll have to first take a seem ripper and pluck out the thread. Then remove the patch.









Pop every stitch out around your patch.
Remove any loose thread with the tweezer end of your seam ripper.
Don’t use a razor as you may cut yourself or your garment.

, You’ll need to iron your sleeve or garment so that there are no wrinkles.









Ironing can also help to smooth out any leftover marks and punctures from a previous patch.
Ironing your garment before sewing will prevent you from sewing over any wrinkles and, therefore, leaving permanent wrinkles in your clothes.

, Make sure your patch is placed correctly before sewing or gluing the patch to the sleeve. If you are sewing a patch on a military uniform you will have instructions on the specific location of the patch.


For example, a Navy striped patch must end 2 inches (51 mm) above the cuff on the sleeve. Refer to any instructions you were given to correctly place patches.
You can either pin the patch on or use glue tape to iron your patch in place.
Ironing the patch on isn’t a permanent solution. It is only to hold the patch in place while you sew. The lack of pins will allow you to sew the patch on without running into any pins.
If you ironed the patch on, let it cool before sewing.

, You can do this either using a sewing machine or hand stitching. 








Use a thread that’s the appropriate color. Match the color of the patch's edges or use clear thread.
If using a machine, make sure you pull the part of the sleeve back that isn’t attached to your patch.

, Take your time so that you get it right and don’t have to start over.









Depending on where your patch is, sewing may be more difficult. If the patch is higher on the arm, you can use your neck opening to separate the layers of fabric. If it’s lower near the cuff, you will have to pay attention to make sure you aren’t sewing through both sides of the sleeves.
Set your machine on a slow setting. If you need to rotate your uniform and patch, raise the foot with the needle still in place. Rotate your garment, then lower the foot.
If hand sewing, take your time so that you can create even spaces between each pass and sew in a straight line. Use a straight stitch on patches.

, Once you’ve made it all the way around your patch, seal the stitch.









Take your scissors and cut away any loose threads. You should leave a little thread about 1/2” (1cm) long. Leaving just a bit ensures that you don’t accidentally cut the knots.

Extend the two parallel lines a few inches and draw a new horizontal line to connect them. This gives you two patterns, one slightly taller than the other.;
, Using one color or pattern of cloth, cut out two pieces to match the smaller pattern, the one that uses the lines tangent to the circle. Using another color or pattern, cut out two pieces according to the second pattern; these will be taller than the others.

In all, you should have two pairs of identical pieces of cloth.

, They should meet at the square edge, so that when you've finished this step, you will have two identical ovals of fabric.


To decorate the bag, sew lace around the edge of the lower part of each oval.

Put the finishing touches on your Inverness cape/cloak.",How to Construct an Inverness Cape/Cloak," Measure yourself, or the wearer of the finished Inverness cape/cloak, to insure that it will actually fit. (You are the assumed wearer in these instructions.) The frock of the finished Inverness cape/cloak, ideally, should NOT have a longer hem than eighteen (18) inches from the floor, to keep you from stepping on it!

The frock should NOT have a straight silhouette. Ideally, it should flare, on each side, to approximately seven point five (7.5) degrees from the pits of its armholes to its hemline, and hence fifteen (15) degrees from the vertical in toto. This serves two functions: it accommodates your mid-section's thickness if any, and it adds volume to the frock, keeping it from hampering your legs' motion.
The capelet can flare to almost any angle; this one flares to a forty-five (45) degree angle on each side from its shared neckline with the frock and the collar base, and hence ninety (90) degrees from the vertical in toto. Its hemline extends the length of your arms AND shoulders, from neckline to wrists.
Use a felt-tip pen or indelible marker, pairs of scissors, and heavy-duty WHITE poster paper, in long rolls, to cut pattern shapes for the pieces.
Trace both front-half and back-half pattern pieces for both the frock and the capelet onto the unrolled poster paper with your felt-tip pen or your indelible marker, using the measurements to guide you, and use a pair of scissors to cut each out.;
, Base the paper pieces of the pattern on the largest and longest overcoat you have that fits you WELL. Trace the outline of only ONE HALF of its body on the unrolled poster paper TWICE, once for each frock paper piece, using your felt-tip pen or your indelible marker. Before you draw the flare of the frock's sides on the pieces, the coat's hemline will be straight; you will curve the hemlines when you trace them.

For the capelet, trace the coat's sleeve line from the edge of the collar to two inches (2"") beyond the sleeve cuff point TWICE, on a separate expanse of the paper. The two straight lines you then draw on that expanse should form an angle of forty-five (45) degrees. Draw two curves, as parallel as you can make them, to join these, then cut out the paper piece for the capelet.
The cut-out frock paper pieces should each resemble one half of an oversized vest. Use the front frock piece twice, once each on the outer fabric and the lining, for both the front of the frock's outer layer and lining, and use the back frock piece for its back. Use the capelet paper piece twice for each of the three pieces of both the outer layer and the lining.

, Wrap any flexible object all the way around your neck, fold it in two, use your felt-tip pen or indelible marker to trace HALF its length on the paper with a gentle curve, and draw a straight line at a right angle to that curve--be sure to allow just over TWICE the height of your neck. Draw a second, gentler curve from there and join it to the first with a second straight line on a small angle from the first. Then use a pair of scissors to cut out the resulting paper piece and place the vertical straight line on both the outer fabric's folds AND the interfacing folds TWICE., Align the edge of the front frock paper piece with the selvages of each fabric--the black raincoat poplin for the frock and the red lining satin for the lining--and use another pair of scissors to cut along the outer edge. Allow a width of three-quarters of an inch (3/4"") of fabric from the paper pieces, to accommodate the seams you will stitch. Align the edge of the back frock paper piece with the foldlines of each fabric and, again, cut along the outer edge, leaving the same seam allowance. Choose wrong sides for the cut frock pieces of both the outer layer and the lining and, using your sewing machine, stitch the outer seams of each together; the front frock pieces should overlap visibly. Do NOT stitch an outer layer piece to a lining piece!, Align one edge of the capelet paper piece with the UNFOLDED selvages of each fabric--the black raincoat poplin for the capelet and the red lining satin for the lining--and, using the pair of scissors you used to cut the frock and the frock lining, and leaving a seam allowance of three-quarters of an inch(3/4""), cut the fabric and the lining along the outer edges. Again, choose wrong sides for the cut pieces and use your sewing machine to stitch the outer seams together; when this is done correctly, the leading edges of the front capelet pieces should overlap visibly. Do NOT stitch an outer layer piece to a lining piece!, Cut two pieces EACH of the interfacing and the collar--for the collar, use the black raincoat poplin ONLY! You will use your steam iron, as well as your sewing machine, here. Choose wrong sides for the cut pieces of the collar, place the cut interface pieces on each with their wrong, or fusible, sides down, and steam-iron the interface pieces in place. Use your sewing machine to stitch the two collar pieces together right side to right side and another one of your pairs of scissors to trim the excess fabric. Turn the collar inside out and use your steam iron to press it into shape., Turn the outer layer and and the lining of the frock right side to right side. Stitch the front and top outer edges of the frock's outer layer and its lining, including the collar, to each other, making sure, in order to allow for the snaps, that you crease the front outer edges of the outer layer OVER those of the lining before you join them--but do NOT stitch the armholes together just yet! Instead, hem the outer layer and the lining separately, without stitching them together either. Then use your steam iron to press the raw edges into creases, leaving more allowance for the outer layer than for the lining, and finally turn the assembled pieces inside out, wrong side to wrong side, matching the creased edges of the armholes and trimming the seam allowances to one quarter inch(1/4""). Finally, you should stitch the armholes together., Turn the outer layer and the lining of the capelet right side to right side. Stitch the front and top outer edges of the capelet's two elements, including the collar, to each other, making sure that you crease the front outer edges of the outer layer OVER those of the lining, and hem the outer layer and the lining SEPARATELY so that they will form perfect semicircles. Then turn the assembled pieces inside out, wrong side to wrong side, trimming the seam allowances to one quarter inch (1/4"")., Align the finished collar edges of the frock and the capelet, with the frock on the outside. Press creases into the raw edges of the turned-out collar and CAREFULLY stitch it between the frock and the capelet to join them both to each other and to the collar. That done, CAREFULLY flip out the capelet so that its lining rests on top of the frock's outer layer., Fold the collar over and outward along its horizontal centerline so that it will frame your neck. You will use your heavy-duty snap-attachers to install NO MORE THAN SIX (6) HEAVY-DUTY SNAPS in the front of the frock, with the caps on the left front if you are a man or the right front if you are a woman. Make sure you align the snaps precisely along the frock front."

Purchase your favorite fabric from your local craft store.,
Buy interfacing for the inside of the tie.,
Purchase the other supplies needed.,
Pick out a pattern.",How to Make a Tie1," You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner.Silk is a popular choice for tie liners.
For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim.;
, Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric.For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on.Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie., In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies:


Fine thread that matches the tie fabric
A good pair of fabric scissors
Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine
Straight pins
Measuring tape
Iron

, There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself.








When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric.
You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam."
"
Start with the classic tie pattern.,
Beware of your fabric shrinking.,
Prepare the fabric.",How to Make a Tie2," This pattern is a simple and versatile style. You can find different variations of outlines that range in width and length. Simply print out the one you prefer and make sure that it is the classic tie pattern and has a diamond cut at the bottom.

, If you're using a fabric other than silk, you should preshrink it by washing and drying it before you iron. This will ensure the fabric doesn't shrink if you have the tie steamed or washed.









If the interfacing has not been preshrunk, preshrink it by soaking it in hot water for 10 minutes, then letting it dry and running an iron over it., Before you begin cutting, be sure to iron the back of the fabric on a low setting to remove any wrinkles, folds or ripples that will cause you to cut the fabric unevenly. To iron, lay the fabric flat on your work surface, ""wrong"" side up, and move the iron in small circles along the material.








"
"
Lay out the tie pattern on the fabric.,
Trace the pattern of the tie.,
Cut the fabric carefully.,
Repeat the process by now tracing the interfacing.,
Cut the back liner.",How to Make a Tie3," It is important to cut the fabric for the tie on the bias (diagonally across the grain) which will allow the tie to have more elasticity. Remember to make sure the fabric is laid out smoothly with no creases.








If the fabric is patterned, envision how the pattern will look once you cut the fabric out. Rearrange the layout of your pattern to make sure it will show nicely.

, Use a weight or pin to hold the pattern outline down. Then, use a piece of chalk to carefully trace around the outline onto the ""wrong"" side of the fabric. Chalk is a safe and easy tracing tool for this type of project.








, Use a sharp pair of fabric scissors to cut the fabric about 3/8in around the outside of the chalk line. This will leave room for you to sew the inseam.If you're using a fabric that's more difficult to work with, you might want to use a rotary cutter instead.









Cut slowly to avoid making a mistake and wasting fabric.

, Lay the tie outline on the interfacing and use chalk to trace the outline. Then, carefully cut out the interfacing using sharp scissors or a rotary cutter. The interfacing will end up having the same shape as the fabric you cut, but it won’t need added seam allowance so cut directly on the chalk line.







, You will need to measure out your back liner to fit the bottom diamond of your tie. This will be used to cover the back of your tie that will be left exposed after your tie is folded over and sewed. It is also a nice place to tuck in the back tail of the tie. It will be cut straight across on top, and then follow the bottom cuts of the tie pattern.








"
"
Check your interfacing.,
Iron on the interfacing.,
Sew on the interfacing.",How to Make a Tie4," Before applying your interfacing to the fabric, double-check that it has been been preshrunk either by the manufacturer or by you. Also, depending on if you purchased sewable or fusible interfacing, be sure to follow the specific instructions for that type.








, If you purchased fusible interfacing, now is the time to iron it to the fabric. You will iron the glossy or bumpy side of the interfacing to the ""wrong"" side of the fabric. The best way to do this is to lay down the fabric with the front side facing the table. Then, lay the glossy side of the interfacing on top of the fabric. Instead of directly ironing on the interfacing, lay a thin towel on top of your interfacing to protect the materials from sliding around or sticking to the iron.








Be sure the interfacing is smoothly ironed onto the entire tie surface.

, If you bought interfacing that has no glue, and was made to be stitched on, you will have to sew it to the fabric. This is a good option if you purchased a tie fabric that is sensitive to heat. You can sew on the interfacing by hand using a needle and thread or a sewing machine. Sew the interfacing to the ""wrong"" side of the tie fabric, and go around the entire edge of the tie.

Sew your tie closed.,
Attach the bottom liner to the back of the tie.,
Use a slip stitch to carefully sew along the middle seam of the underside of the tie.,
Iron the tie to finish your creation.,
Finished!

",How to Make a Tie5," You can use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to do this. Like in most tie patterns, you will sew the point first. Then, you will fold over the back tie pieces to be sewn up the middle.








Make sure the edges are aligned correctly and your stitches are straight.
The tie should be sewn with the fabric folded inward so the seam doesn't show on the outside.

, You will only need to sew the back liner to the three outside edges, and leave the straight line that goes across the tie left open so you can tuck in the back tail later.







, Sew the two edges of the folds closed from the top of the tie to the end of the fold. Be sure not to catch all of the layers as you stitch, since you don't want to be able to see the thread on the front of the tie.







, Use the iron to press out the creases and iron the tie until it is flat. Be sure that you set the iron to an appropriate setting for the material of the tie. Once the tie is smoothed out, it is ready to be tied how you prefer and worn.

Purchase the fabric.,
Wash and/or dry the fabric according to the manufacturer's instructions (before you make the handkerchief), and press.








,
Using a ruler, measure and mark on your fabric the size handkerchief you want to make, plus two inches (5cm).,
Fold the edge over 1/2 inch (about 12mm) and press.

",How to Make a Handkerchief," Check the fabric content to see what kind of maintenance it will require in order to stay looking good. For everyday use, you will probably want something that is washable and requires little ironing.









Rather than purchase fabric, look around in your scraps. This is a great project for using up leftovers or recycling old fabrics. Especially if you are making hankies for everyday use, try old bandannas or pillowcases for the fabric. The advantage is, you will already know how the fabric behaves and holds up.;
,,









Typically, a man's handkerchief is 12x12 inches (about 30cm) square. A woman's is 8x8 (22cm) square, but since you are making your own, you may make it any size you prefer.
Using a sharp pair of scissors, cut the square(s).

Choose the ribbon or trim.,
Buy some elastic.,
Cut the pieces to size.,
Sew the ribbon and elastic together.,
Wear your new headband.",How to Make a Headband1," Craft stores are loaded with cute ribbons and trim. For this project, it is best to choose a ribbon or trim that is thin, measuring 1” wide or less. Ideally it will be the same width as the elastic you use.


If you choose ribbons or trim with embellishments like beads and sequins, make sure that they are only on one side of the ribbon. This way, it won’t get caught in your hair.
When possible, choose trim and ribbon that contains a bit of elastic in the fabric to make wearing more comfortable. Tug on the ribbon or trim to see if it stretches. If it does, then it contains some elastic. You can also use elastic-free ribbon or trim with no issues though.;
, Most fabric and craft stores offer spools of elastic in different colors and widths. You will want to find elastic that is thinner than the ribbon or trim you have chosen, so make sure you know the measurements of your ribbon.









Elastic usually comes in black and white, but you may be able to find other colors as well. Keep in mind that the elastic will be on the bottom half of the headband, but it may still be visible when you wear it.

, Next, you will need to cut the ribbon and elastic so that the ribbon is long enough to wrap around most of your head and there is a few inches of elastic connecting the ends of the ribbon together. Measure them around your head first to determine how long you will need your ribbon to be.








Wrap the ribbon you’ve chosen all the way around your head from the top of your forehead to the nape of your neck, or where you would like your headband to sit. Place your finger on the end of the ribbon where the ribbon begins to overlap itself and mark it with a pen or a bit of chalk.
Measure five inches inward from this spot that you have marked, and then cut the fabric here.
Next, cut four inches of elastic band. This material will connect the two ends of your ribbon. It is important to leave an inch off the total measurement of elastic so that the headband will sit tight enough on your head to prevent it from sliding off. If you want an even tighter headband, you can always use a little less elastic.

, Use a needle and thread to create a small seam at the ends of the ribbon or trim. To do this, fold over the edge of the ribbon or trim and then sew to hold this seam in place. Next, use the needle and thread to sew the elastic to the underside of the seam you just created.If you are using a type of trim that would be difficult to fold over and add a seam or that does not look like it needs one, then you can skip the seam and just sew the elastic to the ends of the ribbon or trim.
Make sure to tie a knot in the thread ends to ensure that they stay put.

, After you finish sewing the elastic to the ribbon or trim, your headband is complete. You can choose to layer it underneath your hair or wear it in the popular bohemian style wrapped over your forehead.

Get an old t-shirt.,
Measure and cut the fabric into strips.,
Sew together the ends of the five strips.,
Braid the strips.,
Sew the other end.,
Complete your headband.,
Try on your headband.",How to Make a Headband2," Find a shirt that is relatively large and made out of a stretchy jersey-like fabric. If you don’t have one on hand, you can purchase one meeting these criteria from thrift stores for very cheap.

, You will need to use a sharp pair of scissors to cut five long strips out of the t-shirt.Measure the length around your head from just above your forehead to the nape of your neck. Then, use this measurement to cut five pieces of fabric of the same length and about 1” wide from your t-shirt. Cut an additional piece that is 3” wide and ⅓ the circumference of your head.

, To secure the ends of the fabric before you start braiding them, use a needle and thread or sewing machine to sew over the ends of the pieces of fabric. Make sure that the ends are all lined up before you start sewing. You can simply stack them on top of each other., Once your strips are sewn together at the ends, you can begin braiding them. You will be doing a five strand braid, which can be a little tricky. You may want to tape the end that you have just sewn to a surface to keep it in place while you braid.


Start by braiding with three strand on the right side. Then, as you continue braiding work towards the left side and grab pieces from that side to incorporate into the braid. Keep working back and forth until you have braided all of the fabric together.Tighten the pieces as you weave by pulling on them when they reach the left side. It will appear slightly bunched when you begin, but will flatten out as you continue the weaving pattern.

, When you get to the end of your braid, sew all five strips together at the other end. Use a needle and thread or sewing machine to sew over the strips as you did before. This will secure your braid., The completed woven strip will have shrunk to be about ⅔ of the total distance around your head, and it will need to be longer to fit your head. You will also need to connect the ends to form the braid into a band. To do this, take the additional piece of fabric cut to 3” wide and attach it to the ends of the braid. Sew the shorter/wider piece to the ends of your braid with a needle and thread., Your headband is now complete and you can try it on. Make sure to position the unwoven piece of fabric you added at the end so that it is on the underside of your head."

Wrap your headband in fabric.,
Cover your headband in yarn or string.,
Add a beaded applique or bunch of feathers.",How to Make a Headband3," Wrapping an old hard headband in fabric is an easy way to repurpose it. You only need a piece of fabric and some glue to do this.


Measure the width of your hard headband, and then choose a piece of fabric that is twice as wide and equally as long. Cut the fabric into a rectangle with those measurements.
Wrap the fabric around the hard headband, and attach the fabric to the underside of the headband with some fabric glue. Tuck the ends of the fabric under as well to create smooth ends.

, There are many lovely shades of yarn and embroidery floss available. Find a few you like and use them to wrap a headband.









Coat the entire headband in a thin layer of glue.
Then, begin at the inside bottom end of one of the headband pieces, and wrap your yarn or string in tight rings around the headband.
Continue until the entire headband is covered, and then cut the excess.
Seal the ends with an extra dab of glue

, Choose a pretty brooch, fabric applique, or grouping of feathers and decide on the perfect location for them on your headband. Then, use hot glue to attach them.








Make sure to use caution when using hot glue! You can also use fabric glue if you prefer.

If it's for a wedding, the ribbon should probably be satin or velvet, although any quality ribbon will be ideal.
As for color, this could be themed with an outfit, it could be blue for the ""something blue"" in a wedding or it might be cream or beige, which is neutral enough to go with any outfit. The ""something blue"" for the garter is actually traditional, and dates back to the fourteenth century––blue symbolizes love, purity and faithfulness.For a stage costume, brighter colors are useful, especially if the garter is meant to be seen by the audience.;
, The wrong sides should face each other so that they end up inside the garter, with the right side facing out.








, Use straight stitch and sew along the edges. It's important to keep as close as you can to the ribbon edging. Once you've stitched down both sides, the result is a casing.








,









An alternative method involves simply stitching the lace straight around the middle of the garter. This requires careful hand stitching to avoid sewing the casing and elastic together though.

, Use a zigzag stitch to keep the lace edging in place.








, You should now have both sides of the garter casing edged with lace.








, Pull this needle through the casing and tie the elastic in a small knot. This will bring the garter together in a round but the ribbon casing won't yet be sewn together. The ribbon should now bunch up around the elastic.








,,,, Hold in place tightly, to gather the tulle into a rosette shape. Stitch the rosette in place on the garter where the two pieces of ribbon were joined together, facing outward.








, Sew into the middle of the rosette.

",How to Make a Mustache Bow Tie," The pattern will also act as the backing on the bow tie, so use something sturdy that also able to be worn comfortably. Ideal backing includes cardboard from a cereal package, poster board or thin plastic folder covers. The pattern should match the usual size of a bow tie––if possible, grab one from your existing collection and take measurements. You can either freehand draw the mustache pattern or print off a version:


To draw a pattern freehand: Draw two paisley designs that join each other in the middle.
To print: Check online for mustache designs that you think will work. Print. Resize if needed using the graph resizing technique.;
, Use sharp scissors or a box cutter to cut through the board or plastic backing chosen. Avoid making jagged edges––snip off any that form.

, The white pencil lines will serve as a visible guide for cutting the felt accurately, especially if you chose to use black.

, Again, use sharp or sewing scissors to cut the felt, for the sharpest, cleanest cut.

, Be sure to align the felt piece so that it fits exactly over the pattern. This creates the sturdiness needed for the bow tie.


Add a dab of hot glue around the perimeter of the mustache pattern. Add a drop of glue every half inch (1.3cm) around the perimeter of the pattern. Add a few drops in the middle of the pattern to ensure a smooth transfer.
Only add a small amount of glue near but not on the edge of the pattern. This will reduce the likelihood the glue will spill over the edge.

, For the best fit, obtain your measurements for accuracy, as follows:


Take collar/neck measurements using a measuring tape. If you don’t have seamstress measuring tape, use a tape measure and wrap it around your shirt collar.
Line the elastic up against the measuring tape and cut to size. Lay the elastic down next to your measuring tape and cut to size.

, The elastic band will hold your bow tie in place. Remember to place elastic underneath the shirt collar to hide it once the tie is in place.


Lay the mustache felt side down on a flat surface. Lay the elastic band across the mustache, lengthwise, checking to be sure that the elastic sits evenly on both sides.
Stitch the elastic in the middle of the mustache. Create a stitch that won’t be overly obvious from the front of the mustache. If the cardboard or plastic you're using is thick, consider trying to just stitch the elastic to the cardboard and avoid hitting the felt.

, Stitch the ends of the elastic together using either the same thread or use white thread for a more finished look.

Organize your sewing area.",How to Make a Purse1," Search online for various sizes and styles. Google the phrase ""Purse Pattern"" or ""Free Purse Pattern,"" and see what comes up. There are many free patterns available, but the pattern you choose will depend on several factors.









The size you need
Your level of sewing ability
The purpose of the purse. Practical? Fashionable? Matching an outfit?

If you don't find exactly what you're looking for online, try your local fabric supply stores.

;
, Read the directions for your chosen pattern carefully and purchase all supplies before beginning. There's nothing more irritating than having to run out to the shop for a notion you overlooked earlier, but cannot continue sewing without.









When getting a fabric, make sure it's strong. Most purse patterns will require sturdy material. Thin, light weight fabrics are unsuitable for all but the smallest handbags.

, You'll find it easiest and less stressful to work in a wide, clean environment. Clear any other projects you may have been working on to concentrate on this one.









Remove any liquids! A nice coffee stain on your fabric matches very few things.

Cut the fabric.,
Assemble a basic purse.,
Pin or baste all seams before sewing.,
Seal the seams.,
Marvel at your handiwork.",How to Make a Purse2," The old adage ""measure twice, cut once"" holds true in sewing as much as it does in carpentry. In sewing patterns, watch for things such as ""cut on fold"" or instructions such as ""cut two from fabric and two from interfacing.""









Pin the pattern to your fabric to make cutting a little more fool-proof and easier to manage.














, Follow the pattern instructions carefully. Generally the author has put this purse together several times before and can save you a lot of time and wasted effort by providing the best instructions.









Don't throw away your extra material! Keep it for a matching coin purse or second patchwork project.

, This will aid in assembly and ensure evenly spaced seams.









This makes a temporary seam that is easily removed and re-done if the purse does not look the way you want. This will save you a lot of time in undoing a more tightly sewn seam if things go wrong.













You can baste by hand or by machine, depending on your circumstances and what you prefer.

, Remember that not all seams can be sewn by machine. You will have some hand work to do no matter which pattern you choose.








, Now you can add any embellishments you like to make your purse your own.









Consider ribbons, flowers, or pins to give it a signature look.

The shape is a little like a kidney bean, only not as steeply dipped in the center. The size is up to you; consider how many coins you're likely to want to carry and how much room you have in your handbag. It is recommended that you keep the length under 20cm/7.8"" and within 10cm/3.9"" width to keep it compact.

Cut out the template in readiness for use on the fabric.;
, Pin the paper template to the fabric in readiness for cutting. Then cut as follows:

2 pieces of external fabric following the eggplant template; this will be from the colored cotton fabric
2 pieces of plain cotton fabric lining
2 more pieces of plain cotton fabric for lining.

, Draw simple leaf shapes (see the image above as guidance) on paper. Cut out the template, pin to the felt and cut out four felt leaves., Face the right side of both fabrics together and pin in place. Stitch together, all the way around apart from the mouth end (the end the purse opens from)––leave an opening about 4-5cm/1.5-2"". Then turn the external part of the bag inside out., Sew the cotton fabric lining pieces together, using the same method. Leave an opening with length of 4-5cm/1.5-2"".
Then, place the lining fabric bag inside the outside fabric bag. Stitch together all the way around, apart from the open mouthpiece.

, Adjust the shape to neaten as needed. Then glue on the four felt leaves, cascading down each side of the mouth. Use a decorative stitch, such as blanket stitch.

, Insert the mouth opening into the gap of the purse frame, carefully aligning it over the mouth stitching and maybe just a little part of the leaf ends if they come up that high. You may need to wiggle the material a little to fit it properly., Gluing is a little faster but can be messier and less durable, while stitching requires a little extra effort but will likely last longer. Here is how to do both ways:

For gluing, use a fabric glue. Be careful not to overdo the glue––wipe away any excess glue immediately or it might dry as a noticeable blob.
For stitching, use an embroidery needle that is thin enough to fit through the hole. While holding the frame and the purse fabric together with your other hand, insert the needle from the wrong side of the purse about 5mm/0.19"" away from the fabric's edge into the second hole of the frame to start. Then insert the needle into the first hole. From here, insert into the third hole from the wrong side again, then sew back into the second hole. Repeat the stitching for the rest of the frame in the same fashion. Pull firmly after each stitch, to ensure smooth and even stitches from both sides. Knot well when you reach the end. Pliers can be used to squeeze each end of the purse frame to prevent it from moving off the purse; if so, cover the frame with a piece of scrap fabric before applying the pliers, so as to protect the frame's finish.

, Your eggplant purse is now ready for use.

One pillowcase will form the outside of the bag, one will form the inner lining, and the other will form the strap.;
, Cut one of the pillowcases to form the straps by cutting the edge with the zipper, as well as the edge on the opposite side. Now cut the remainder to form six 5” by 15” strips.

, From four of the six pieces, stitch their ends together so they form one long 5” wide strip.

, With right (patterned) sides facing each other, stitch the long sides together to form a tube. Use your preferred method to turn the tube right side out.

, Stitch a rectangle over the seams where you joined the pieces. Flip in the ends about 3” on each side and then edge stitch all along the entire strap.

, Pin the ends of the straps to the pillowcase you are using as the main section of the bag such that the zipper is open and at the top and the side seams align with the center of strap. The straps should be placed far enough down so that the folded in 3” section is entirely on the bag.

, Iron flat and then edge stitch a rectangle at the end of the strap to join it to the bag (this rectangle should follow the 3” folded section). Make an “x” across the rectangle to reinforce. Do this for both sides.

, Fold in and iron the edges of one of the remaining strap pieces, so that the edge looks clean when viewing the facing side. Pin it to the facing side of the lining pillowcase, in the upper half section towards the zipper. Sew along the bottom edge and sides with one seam in the middle to form two pockets.

, Trim off the zipper and iron the edges down, so that the edge is clean. Flip the pillowcase inside out and place it inside the main bag. Pin together and then sew, one side and then the other, remembering to backstitch at each of the four ends. You’re done!

Make a closing strap.",How to Make a Messenger Bag2," You’ll need a pattern and supplies in order to make this bag. Thankfully, the supplies are minimal and the pattern is very simple. Having everything you need before you start will make the process more smooth and efficient.


Make a pattern, if you want to. The main portion of the bag will be formed from one single piece of tape-fabric (pieces of duct tape, layered to create a single surface). The shape will overall resemble one large rectangle with two smaller rectangles attached at it’s side.
You will, of course, need duct tape to make the bag from. You can find duct tape in a variety of locations and it is available in a wide range of colors and patterns.
You will need fixtures for the bag. Four fixtures (two large, two small) will be needed to attach straps to the bag and you will need one buckle to close it with, as well as reinforcing rings for the buckle holes. All of these can be purchased from craft stores or salvaged from second-hand purses or messenger bags.
Importantly, you will need a surface on which to build your bag and straight pins to keep the tape in place while you work. A large sheet of cardboard will be the cheapest and simplest solution.
Finally, you will need a standard ruler (wood or metal), a measuring tape and cutting tools. The ruler will be sacrificed to reinforce the handle of the bag, so be sure it is one you will not need to use later.

, With the sticky side facing up, lay out seven 36” strips, parallel, absolutely straight, and overlapping (but as little as possible). Pin the ends taught as you lay each strip.

, With sticky side still facing up, lay six more 35” strips over the first layer with a 1” offset. Do not worry about pinning these. Be careful to lay them straight and go slowly, since it is difficult to get the tape back up if you make a mistake.

, Cut 6 strips to 11.25” and place them using the same method as the previous layers. Place them perpendicular and covering the previous layers, at the “top”end.

, Cut four more 11.25” strips and place two on each side, parallel with the strips from the first two layers, such that the ends line up with the middle of the last strip from layer 3. Pin these strips in place.

, Cut 4 more 11” strips and layer them over the others, with a 1” offset so that the seam with the main section is covered.

, Cut ~19” strips to cover the middle section (the section with the side panels). These should be placed parallel to and beginning at the other strips from layer 3, covering the . Once you reach the edge of sides, switch to 11.25” strip and cover the remainder of the layer.

, This will be done similarly to layer 3 but with the strips facing sticky side down. Use 11.25” strips for the two narrower sections and then 19” strips for the wider center section where the sides attach.

, Unpin this completed piece and fold it into a bag. The side panels form the narrow sides of the bag, with the section directly between them forming the back side of the bag. The section directly below forms the bottom and front of the bag (and should fold up to align the bottom edge with the top of the side panels). The remaining top section forms the top and front flap of the bag. The result should be a box-shaped bag with clean edges.

, Use tape on the inside of the bag to close all the seams together and reinforce the corners and edges of the bag. Don’t forget to leave the top end open.

, Create a 5’ long strip of tape by folding 12” sections in half with one nested in the next as it is folded. Coil the long strip into a loop with the two smaller fixtures at each end and at the center of the loop. Compress the loop and then circle tape around it to form the handle, closing in the two fixtures at either end.

, Use 4 more 12” folded strips, one completely encased in the other, to form 2 handles. Lace these through the fixtures.

, Cut 2 slits in the top of the bag where the handle will be placed, 1” long and parallel to the width of the bag. Lace the ends of the handle attachment strips through the holes. Trim a ruler to fit the length of the top and, folding the two inner ends of the strips down into the center, attach them to the ruler. Now attach the outer two ends to the ruler and tape the entire ruler to the bag, encasing and securing it.

, Cut lengths at least 10” and mate the sticky sides, nesting one set inside another as before until an acceptably long strip is formed. Get a piece the length of the whole strap and place the strap so that the edge runs down the center of the new piece. Fold it over to close the seam of the mated strips and then repeat on the other side.

, Cutting two more 10” mated strips, form a loop and place the large fixtures inside. Anchor one half of the loop to the inside of the bag and the other half to the outside of the bag. Lace the shoulder strap through the anchored fixtures, fold over the ends, and seal them closed using more tape.

, Attach the buckle to the bottom of the bag on the front side, using the same method as for the shoulder strap anchors. You will need to make two holes for the buckle pins.

, Make a strap using mated tape, as in previous steps. Use the reinforcing rings (inside the mated pieces of tape) at the points where the buckle pins will need to fit through. The strap will need to be at least as tall as the front section of the bag. Join this strap to the front flap. Add a cover strip to the buckle if you wish to. You’re done!

Mark the desired position of the twist button onto the bag front fabric piece. Take the twist button and press the prongs into the fabric so as to make two indents in the fabric, if you like you can go over these indents with pen so you can see them more clearly.
, Take a stitch ripper and carefully make two tiny slits into the prong markings. Push through through all of the layers. Push the prongs of the twist button into the right side of the fabric, slip the metal washer over the prongs (at the wrong side) and then press the prongs down away from each other with your thumb.

Be sure to double check that the button is straight (and not wonky) before you push the prongs down! Push prongs down away from each other. Be nice and firm with it to ensure the button will be well secured into the fabric., Make up your bag flap. Finish making your bag and place your flap over the twist button and mark the position where the flap falls onto the twist button.,, When you've unscrewed the plate, you'll see that one half of the plate has a raised lip. Get an ink pen and draw on the raised lip (including the lip around the outer-side of the screw holes) like in the picture. This will enable you to press the lip onto the bag front to get an ink imprint which will serve as the cutting guide., Draw around the ink imprint with pen if necessary., Using the cutting guide just made in the previous step, use small sharp scissors to cut a hole that is slightly smaller than your ink imprint. It is very important that the hole is slightly too small or the twist plate will not be secure. Cut a bit and test, cut a bit more and test and so on. Don't worry, go slow and all will be well.
, Sandwich the fabric bag flap in between the front and back parts of the twist plate (at the hole you have just made) and screw the back of the twist plate to the front plate.

Use your lunch bag.",How to Make a Lunch Bag," Making your own lunch bag is easy, but you will need some special materials to do it. Before you get started, you will need to get:Vinyl or oil cloth
Fabric in the print of your choice
Accent fabric (a very small piece for adding a pocket)
Ribbon
Velcro
Spray adhesive
Sewing machine
Scissors
Ruler
Chalk;
, You will need to have different cuts of the vinyl, printed fabric, and accent fabric. Cut the fabric into the following pieces:








2 - 8 ½” by 4” pieces of vinyl.
2 - 8 ½” by 4” pieces of printed fabric.
1 -25 ½” by 7” piece of vinyl fabric.
1 - 25 ½” by 7” piece of printed fabric.
1 - 4” by 4” piece of vinyl fabric.
1 - 4” by 4” piece of accent fabric.

, You will also need to cut your ribbon and Velcro into some special pieces to create your reusable lunch bag. Before you get started, you will need:








1 – 3 ½” piece of Velcro
2 – 7 ½” pieces of ribbon

, Vinyl is thicker than normal fabric, so a standard needle may not be strong enough. If you have a heavy duty, then you may want to use it for this project.If you do not have a leather needle, then you can try using a heavy duty needle or test stitch a small piece of the vinyl with your other fabric to see how your machine handles it.

, The vinyl is what makes your lunch bag waterproof and it needs to be on the entire inside of the bag. To line the inside of the lunch bag with vinyl, you will first need to match up your like-size pieces of vinyl and fabric. Then, spray the wrong sides of the vinyl with spray adhesive and press the wrong sides of the fabric onto these pieces.








Start by spraying the adhesive onto the wrong side of one of the vinyl pieces.
Then, carefully line up the wrong side of the fabric with the side of the vinyl piece you just sprayed.
Make sure that the edges are even and then smooth out the fabric with your hands.
Trim any excess fabric from the edges.
Repeat this for all of the matching vinyl and fabric pieces that you cut out.

, The pocket will need to be placed on the fabric side of the vinyl and fabric combo piece that you just created. Measure from the short end of the piece and use your chalk to mark the fabric at 7 ½” from the end. Then, measure again from the side of the fabric and mark at 1 1/8” from the edge.The areas you have marked will help you to place the pocket when you are ready.
The 7 ½” mark will indicate the top of the pocket and the 1 1/8” mark will indicate the side of the pocket.

, You should have a 4” by 4” vinyl piece and a 4” by 4” accent fabric piece that you connected with spray adhesive. Take this combo piece to your sewing machine. Then, sew along the outer edges of these two pieces.








Stitch these two pieces close to the edge, about 1/8” away from the edges.

, Next, place the pocket on the location you marked. Make sure that the vinyl side of the pocket piece is facing the fabric part of the bag piece. Then, sew along three of the edges to create the pocket.








Make sure to leave one edge open. Do not sew around all four edges.

, Before you sew the Velcro onto the vinyl and fabric sides of your vinyl and fabric combo piece, pull the strip apart. Then, take a moment to mark the vinyl and fabric with the chalk. This will help to ensure that the Velcro is centered and placed in the correct locations.








Mark the vinyl about 3/4 of an inch from the short edge. Make this mark so that it is above the opening of the pocket on the opposite side.
Then, mark the fabric about 3 ½” from the other edge on the side below the bottom of the pocket.

, Next, you can sew the Velcro onto the locations you have marked. Double check to make sure that you have placed the Velcro where you marked your fabric and vinyl. When you are ready to sew, sue your sewing machine to stitch along the edges of the Velcro.








Go around the Velcro a couple of times to ensure that the Velcro pieces are secured.
Velcro is available in sew-on and adhesive backed types.Since you will be sewing the Velcro on, you do not need the adhesive type.

, The handle will just be made from the two pieces of ribbon that you cut. To make the handle, line up the two pieces of ribbon and then use your sewing machine to sew the edges together. Sew a line down the center of the ribbon pieces as well to make the handle extra durable.








Make sure that the two pieces of ribbon are lined up evenly before you start sewing.
You might want to go around the edges twice to ensure that the stitches are secure.

, Next, you can attach your handle to the bag. The handle will need to go on the fabric side of the vinyl and fabric combo piece. Place the handle a few inches above the pocket, but below the Velcro that is attached to the vinyl side.








Push the edges of the ribbon in so that the ribbon creates a handle shape.
Then, sew along the ends of the handle, but not in the center. Go over the ends of the handle multiple times to ensure a sturdy handle.

, To finish the bag, you will just need to connect the side pieces to the main bag. Sew one edge at a time, starting with one of the 8 ½” edges.








Line up one of the side pieces with your large bag piece. Start by sewing a side piece to the side of your bag that does not have the Velcro on it.
Line up the top edges and sides and make sure that the vinyl sides are facing each other.
Then, sew along the side edge where the two pieces meet. Do not sew along the top (short) edge.

, Next, you will need to sew the short edge of your 8 ½” by 4” piece to the side of the large piece. To do this, bend the large piece and line it up with the short edge of the 8 ½” by 4” piece. Then, sew along this edge.








Make sure that the vinyl sides are still facing together as you sew and line up the edges evenly.
You will have to manipulate the fabric and hold these pieces together tightly as you sew them.

, To complete one side of the bag, you will need to bend the large piece up again and match it up with the remaining long side of the 8 ½” piece. Sew these pieces together.








The vinyl sides should be facing each other and the edges should be even.
Hold the fabric tightly as you sew to prevent the pieces from slipping.

, To complete your bag, you will need to sew the second side piece onto the other side of the bag in the same fashion. Repeat the same sewing pattern of sewing along the side, short end, and remaining long edge of the side piece.








Remember to make sure that the vinyl sides are facing each other.

, After you finish sewing the second side piece into place, your lunch bag will be ready to use! You can fill it with lunch items for yourself or for your child.

, Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the long edges and one of the narrow edges down by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeter). Secure the edges with sewing pins, then iron them flat.Do this step for both fabric rectangles.

, Do not sew the two fabric rectangles together just yet. Simply sew along both of the side edges and the bottom edge on each piece. Remove the pins as you sew.

, Take one of the fabric pieces, and turn it so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold the top, raw edge down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron. Fold it down again, but this time by 2 inches (5.08 centimeters), and press it flat with an iron.Secure the folded edges with sewing pins, if you need to.

, Sew it as close to the bottom, folded edge of the casing as you can. If you used sewing pins to hold the fabric down, be sure to remove them as you go. You can use a thread color that matches your fabric, or a contrasting color for something more interesting.

, Use a color that either matches your bag, or contrasts with it. Avoid using cord that is too thin or too rough, or it will ""bite"" into your shoulder when you wear the bag.

, The paper side is the smooth side. The rough side is the adhesive side.


Iron-on adhesive is also called ""no-sew fusible web"" and ""heat-n-bond.""

, Make sure that you are pinning the iron-on adhesive to the wrong side of the fabric. Also, make sure that the smooth, paper side of the iron-on adhesive is facing up.Consider using a contrasting or color for the fabric. For example, if your back is a solid black color, choose a colorful print for your appliqué.

, Each iron-on adhesive will be a little different. If you are in doubt, start with a lower heat setting. Avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become stiff., Cut right along the lines that you drew; there is no need to leave seam allowances.

, Make sure that you are pinning the appliqué adhesive-side-down. Also, make sure that you are pinning it to the right side of your backpack piece.


You can also pin the appliqué to a pocket piece instead. You must do it before sewing the pocket onto the bag, however.

, Again, avoid using too much heat, or the glue will harden and become brittle. Once the appliqué cools, pull the sewing pins out.

, You can use a thread color that matches the appliqué, or you can use a contrasting one. If you are using a straight stitch, try to sew as close to the edge of the shape as you can. If you are using a zigzag stitch, sew right over the edge instead. This will help anchor your appliqué to the backpack as well as add some design., You can use the same color as your bag, or a contrasting color. Here are the recommended dimensions for the pockets:Inside: 6 by 7 inches (15.24 by 17.78 centimeters)
Outside: 8 by 10 inches (20.32 by 25.4 centimeters)

, Turn the fabric so that the wrong side is facing you. Fold both of the short edges and one of the long edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). If you need to, use sewing pins to keep the fabric in place.


Leave one of the long edges alone. You will be folding it differently.

, Fold it by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) first, then press it flat with an iron. Fold it again, by this time by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Press the edge flat with an iron once more. This will be the top edge of your pocket.

, Try to get as close to the bottom fold as possible. You can use the same color thread as your fabric, or a contrasting one.

, Pin the big pocket to the right side of your first backpack piece. Pin the small pocket to the wrong side of your other backpack piece. Try to pin the smaller pocket towards the top of the backpack piece.


If you wish to add an appliqué to the outside pocket, do that before you pin it.

, When sewing your inside pocket, use a thread color that matches the backpack fabric. This way, the stitching won't be visible as much from the outside. You can use any thread color you want for the outside pocket: the same color as the pocket, or a contrasting on.


Do not sew along the top edge of the pocket.
To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times along the start and end of your sewing.

, Make sure that everything is aligned.

, Start just below the casing, and finish just below the casing. To prevent unraveling, sew back and forth a few times over the start and end of your sewing.


Do not start sewing from the top of the bag. If you do, you will sew the casing shut, and won't be able to use your bag.

, Clip a safety pin to one of the 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords. Starting from the front-left side of the bag, push it all the way through the front and back casing, until it comes out the back-left side of the bag. Repeat this step with the other cord, but start from the right side of the bag., Make a mark on the fabric where you need the grommets to go first, then make a small ""X"" shaped hole using a craft blade. Set the grommet using the manufacturer's instructions.


Do not make the hole too big. You want the fabric to stretch around the base of the grommet as you push it through. If you make the hole too big, the grommet will fall out.

, Take both of the left-side cords, and pull them through the left grommet; you want the cords to be coming out of the front of the bag. Tie the ends of the cords into a tight, overhand knot. Repeat this step for the cords on the right side of the bag.


If the cords are too thin or the grommet is too big, the knot may not be able to hold the cords in place. Instead, pull just one of the cords through the grommet, then knot both ends of the cord together.

, Place these at 2.5cm/1 inch intervals. These form the fringe.

, Cut all of the vertical lines up to the horizontal line. Do not cut beyond the horizontal line.


This includes cutting open the sides of the t-shirt from the base to the horizontal line.

, Cut as close to the seam as you can manage.


For the neck hole, you may choose to leave it or cut it. Estimate how much space there is to fit in groceries before deciding.
Always undercut the neck space; you can always cut more if needed.

, Tie front and back fringe strips together using square knots. Do this right across the bag until all the fringe strips are tied in place. This will make the base of the bag. If you don't like the small gap holes this process leaves, run a line of stitching across the base, just above the tied fringe.

, This step is optional but pretty. You can tie on beads, bells, etc.

, The bag is now ready for carrying your groceries.

Any type of fabric will work, whether you want to use denim from an old pair of jeans or buy expensive satin to make a fancy tote bag. Here are a few things to keep in mind when you're picking out fabric:









If you're going to use the tote to carry heavy items like books, you'll want to choose a sturdy fabric. Go for heavy cotton, corduroy, or some type of thick polyester fabric. Lighter fabrics will rip if you try to carry something heavy or sharp.
There are many great patterns to choose from, but if you plan to decorate your tote bag, you might want to go with a solid color to offset the decorations.
If you'd like to make a lined tote bag, pick out two types of fabric. Liner is usually made from a softer fabric, while the outer fabric is usually something sturdier.
Note that heavy fabrics will require stronger needles and/or a heavier-duty sewing machine to sew.
If you're using brand new fabric, you might want to wash and iron it first so that it doesn't shrink after you make the tote.;
, You get to choose how large or small the tote bag will be. Measure out a rectangle and use a pencil or a fabric pen to mark where you're going to cut. Use fabric scissors to cut the rectangle out neatly. Repeat with a second piece of fabric so that you have two fabric rectangles.









Keep in mind that the finished tote bag will be an inch or so smaller than the rectangle, since the fabric will be hemmed.
If you're making a lined tote bag, cut out two rectangles of the outer fabric and two rectangles of the liner fabric.
Here are a few size suggestions:

12 x 14 inches for a very small tote
14 x 16 inches for a medium tote
24 x 20 inches for a large beach tote



, Fold the rectangles in thirds lengthwise and use a fabric pen or pencil mark the two inside creases. These marks will show you where to center the handles later, so be sure to fold across the length of the fabric, and not down it, to position them correctly.








, It's easiest to hem the top edges of the tote, which will become the two edges at the opening, before you sew the body of the tote. To do this, lay out the rectangles so that the ""wrong"" side of the fabric - the side on which the pattern is less bright - is facing up. Fold the top edge of the fabric down by one inch. Use straight pins to keep the fold in place, and run an iron along its edge to create a crease. Repeat with the other rectangle so that the hem will be the same on both pieces. Use a sewing machine or work by hand to create a straight stitch 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) below the folded edge of the fabric on both rectangles.









If you're making a lined tote, lay the lining rectangle on top of the rectangle of outer fabric. Fold the edges down together, use straight pins to keep them in place, and sew the pieces together with a straight stitch.
If you sew an uneven line, use a seam ripper to rip out the stitch and start over.

, Place the hemmed rectangles back-to-back so that the wrong sides of the fabric are facing out. Sew along the sides and bottom using a straight stitch. Remember to keep the top open.








, Fold the bag so that, instead of coming together at a 90-degree angle, the bottom and side seam are stacked on top of one another. Now sew across the corner, keeping the new seam perpendicular to the existing seams. Repeat this process on the other corner. When you flip the bag right-side-out, the corners will be blunted.








, Decide how long you want the handles to be (keeping in mind that they will be looped) and cut two 2-inch-wide strips of equal length from the fabric. Fold each strip in half so that the inside of the fabric faces outward. Use an iron to crease the fold.








, Use a sewing machine or work by hand to make a straight stitch along the long edges of both handles. Turn the handles right-side-out by feeding a wire from a coat hanger through the tube, attaching it end to the end of the tube (whether by hooking or tying it), and pulling it back through to invert the tube. Flatten the handle with an iron.









Alternatively, you can fold the raw edges of the handle to the middle and zig-zag-stitch them in place (as seen in the image).

, Fold the ends of your handles under by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) and iron them to create a crease. Place the ends over the marks you made to show where the handles should go. Place the ends approximately 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) below the edge of your bag opening and pin or baste them in place.








, Top-stitch a square onto the overlapping handle fabric to hold it firmly in place.








, This is a popular way to decorate tote bags. Create a neat design and make it into a stencil, then use paint or ink to apply the image to your tote bag. Be sure to choose a color that will show up well against the fabric.








, If you want your bag to sparkle, consider adding some rhinestones. You'll need a hot glue gun and a bag of sparkly stones. Glue the rhinestones to your tote bag in a fun shape, such as a star, a heart, or a swirl.








, Get some fabric paint from an art supply or craft store, and use it to decorate your bag in whatever way you choose. You can work with stencils or freehand to make an interesting design.








, This is a trendy, inexpensive way to decorate your new tote bag. Use old buttons you already have or pick some up at the fabric or craft store.








, Create an applique design and sew it to your tote bag in the form of a patch. You can make an applique using your favorite photograph, your initials, or an original drawing - the sky's the limit.

, On what will form the top side of the felt, draw the appearance of your scissors on the felt with tailor's chalk. See the image for guidance. Repeat with both pieces of felt if you like.

, Choose a thread color that complements the fabric nicely.

, Use paint, markers, glitter, buttons or other glue-ons, or anything else you like. Be creative, and do as much or as little decorating as you want.

, Cut out two pieces of cotton lining 2mm smaller than the felt fabric pieces. This should be a thin piece of cotton that you can easily attach to the case without weighing it down or bulking it up. It will add strength and durability to your case and keep the scissors from catching on the felt when slipped in and out.

, Make sure you glue the cotton to the bottom or inside of the felt, rather than the outside - you don't want it to cover up any of your decorations. Use Tacky Glue to secure the lining, but be careful not to use too much as it can soak through the felt and leave unsightly stains.

, Lay the two pieces of felt together, with the attached lining sides facing inward towards each other.

, Make sure to sew as close as possible to the outside of the felt - sewing too far in from the edge will limit the amount of space inside the case and possibly make it too small for the scissors. Do not sew the top; this is where the scissors are pushed in and pulled out from.

, Check that your scissors fit snugly and it's all set to use."

, Draw the outline approximately 1 centimeter (0.4 in) larger than what is necessary in order to give space for sewing.








, No jagged edges should remain on the pattern.








, Use a fabric pencil to trace the design.

Fold leg pieces together so you will have formed two sides of one leg (essentially the pant will look like the original sewed pair but folded).,
Sew the sides of the fabric together with fine stitching, using your sewing machine or a needle and thread.,
Fold down the top of the pajama bottom the height of the elastic for the waist (about 1cm).,
Turn one leg inside out and slip it inside the other leg.,
Sew along the crotch line.",How to Make Pajama Pants3," When you have an even match, pin sides together.








,









Make sure the patterned/ colored side of the fabric is facing each other. #*Do not sew the top (where the waist would be) and the bottom (at the foot of the pajama leg).

, Stitch a horizontal sewing all round the waistband. Leave a little space at the side where you would slot in the elastic later on.








, Match up side seams and pin up both sides to the crotch area.








, Remove pant leg from the other and turn pants inside out (they should now start looking like actual pants).

Create the area to hold the waistband and elastic by folding down top of the fabric approximately ½ “ and press using an iron.,
Sew this area around the pins.,
Cut a piece of ½” elastic that is long enough to fit around the waist.,
Bunch pants up so that the open ends get closer to each other.,
Finish pants by hemming the bottom.",How to Make Pajama Pants4,"









Fold pant tops down again approximately 1” and press.
Pin all the way around the waist and leave an opening on each side that is around 3” (so you can add the elastic).

, Remove pins as you add stitches. Stop at the opening.








, Add an extra three or four inches to be on the safe side.









Place a large safety pin at the end of the elastic. The pin will act as your guide to push the elastic around the inside.

,









Push the elastic through, pin side first so it circles the inside of the waistband and comes out the other end.
Sew ends together and then trim off the excess elastic. Sew the open part of the pants together.

, Fold the ends upward and inside the legs to the desired length. Pin and then sew ends closed.

Sew the crotch piece together.,
Line the seams up and sew.,
Add a cotton lining.,
Admire the finished product.",How to Make a Thong1," Take a measuring tape and measure the circumference of your hips, or wherever you desire the thong to rest, to determine the length of the band for your thong. Then, to figure out how long your crotch pieces need to be, take the measuring tape and measure in line with your belly button, slightly below your hips, and pull the tape underneath your crotch, through your legs, and top the top of your hips on your backside.;
, Purchase lace trim that is as long as the measurements for the waistband and two times the measurements for the crotch. Depending on the width you desire for your thong, the lace should be about two inches wide. You will also need a piece of cotton fabric for the lining that is about three square inches. Make sure the cotton fabric is similar to the color of lace you choose.

, You will divide your lace into four pieces, two for the band of your thong, and two for the crotch of your thong. Taking your hip measurements, divide by two, then cut the lace into two pieces for those measurements. Next, you'll cut your crotch piece by taking your crotch measurements and cutting two equal strips to be the length of the measurements.


For example, if you measured 38 inches for your hips, you'll divide by two and you'll come out with 19 inches for each strip. Then if you measured 10 inches for your crotch piece, you'll just cut two 10 inch pieces of lace.

, Before you begin sewing, you'll need to pin your lace together. First, pin your hip pieces together by laying one on top of the other and then place one pin vertically on each end.

, Lay your crotch pieces on top of each other, but instead of two vertical pins, you'll create a line of horizontal pins through the middle of the lace. Start at one end of your lace and place pins horizontally going across the fabric. As you start to reach the other end of your lace, begin pointing pins toward the bottom corner of your fabric, creating a down diagonal. , Using a sewing a machine, or a needle and thread if you are courageous, sew both pieces together. For the best stitch, you'll want to use a serger or a zigzag stitch. Taking the waistband, sew both ends together, allowing the stitch to hang over the lace, meaning you shouldn't have any extra fabric sticking out past the stitch. , This piece will be sewn a bit differently as you'll be sewing through the middle of your pieces rather than the end. Follow the pins that you placed through your thong, sewing through the middle and then down the diagonal towards the bottom corner. This will create a wider piece for the front of your thong that meets with the waistband. , Taking your crotch piece, line up the wider side with one side of your waistband, both with the insides facing out and sew along the top of the crotch piece and the bottom of the waistband using a zigzag stitch. Then, do the same with other side of the crotch piece to the other end of your waistband.


You should see a continuous seam, meaning you matched the seam of the crotch piece up with each seam on the waistband.

, This isn't necessary, but it is good for hygiene purposes and comfort. Taking your cotton fabric, cut a piece that fits nicely inside the crotch of your thong, and sew along three sides of the fabric, leaving the highest side (the side that will be more in the front of the thong) open.

, After you've finished sewing, turn your thong right side out and try it on. Because the lace is stretchy you shouldn't have had to add any extra material. If you decide the bands are too thick or not thick enough, consider buying lace trim that is less than or more than two inches wide.

Sew the thong together.",How to Make a Thong2," For this type of thong, you will need a piece of fabric about 10 inches by 12 inches that is somewhat stretchy. You'll also need some elastic for the waistband and leg holes in your thong. Pick a color you want to match your fabric because this elastic will show. If you find that elastic is uncomfortable, you can always try substituting it for some stretchy lace, although it may not attach quite as well to your underwear.

, Before you cut your fabric, you'll want to create a pattern for your thong that feels most comfortable to you. A good starting point is to cut a triangle out of a piece of paper with the two longest sides at 9 inches and the top, shortest side at 7.25 inches. Hold the triangle up to yourself and decide if it needs to be bigger or smaller, and then cut it to fit the dimensions you would like for your thong.When making your thong, the tip of the triangle should point down, so cut your fabric with that in mind.

, Once you have decided on the dimensions for the pattern for your thong, lay the paper pattern over your fabric, trace a triangle onto your fabric, and then cut it out. If you are using a very stretchy fabric you can cut the exact dimensions of the pattern, but if your fabric has only a little stretch to it you may want to cut a slightly bigger piece so you have more fabric to work with. , You will need elastic for the waistband, the back of your thong, and for the two sides of your thong. The elastic for the sides should be one inch shorter than the side length of the triangle (you will stretch it as you sew) and the piece for the back should be about 8 inches, but you can adjust for your comfort.

, Elastic for the waistband needs to be about one inch shorter than your hips or waist measurement, depending on where you plan to wear your thong. Use a measuring tape to measure waist or hips, and then cut a piece of elastic one inch less than that measurement.


Depending on where you want your thong to sit will determine if you use your hip or waist measurements, and will also determine the length of your back elastic. If you want a higher thong, you'll need more back elastic and less elastic for your waistband, but if you want your thong to sit on your hips you'll likely need more elastic for the waistband and less for the back elastic.

, Take your elastic and place it on top of your fabric at the edge, on the two longest sides of your thong (the sides that point downwards to make a V). Then, place a pin at the top of the side elastic and one at the bottom. You'll then want a pin in the middle of the fabric, so pull the fabric from both sides to stretch it out, and place a pin in the elastic towards the middle, while fabric is still stretched. When you let the fabric go your fabric may crumple up a bit, but once you sew the elastic into it and put it on, it will stretch to fit.

, Once you have finished pinning, using a stretch stitch or a zigzag stitch, sew along the elastic, pulling and stretching the fabric as you go so that it lines up evenly.

, After you have sewn the elastic to the sides of your fabric, you'll want to connect your back elastic to the front of the thong by attaching one end of the back elastic to the bottom point of your triangle, and sewing a small seam, making sure the elastic is in the back of the fabric.

, Before you sew your waistband to your thong, you'll want to sew the ends together, making a nice circle with your waistband. Then, sew the loose end of the back elastic to the waistband, making sure the back elastic is inside the waistband. , Fold the waistband in half, with the back elastic resting on the fold of the waistband. The opposite fold will be the center of your thong -- place a pin there. Then, take the center of the top of your triangle and line it up with that pin, connecting it with another pin. Your elastic waistband should be on top of your triangle fabric, to match the sides of the triangle.

, Sew along the elastic, connecting the waistband to the top of the triangle fabric and making sure to stretch the fabric as you go. Then, cut any extra threads and try your thong on, admiring your finished product! "

Add the final touches.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Garter for Homecoming1," You will need three lengths of 1-1/2 inch (3.8 cm) base ribbon and two lengths of 5/8 inch (1.6 cm) accent ribbon.


Use your two main school colors for the ribbons. Alternatively, you could also use colors that match your homecoming dress.
The accent ribbon should be made of an opaque material, like satin. The base ribbon can either be opaque or sheer. For instance, organza ribbon is a relatively easy sheer ribbon to work with.Measure the circumference of the wearer's leg and add 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) to that number. Cut two lengths of base ribbon and another of accent ribbon using this measurement. These pieces of ribbon are for the garter itself.
Cut 12 inches (30.5 cm) of base ribbon and accent ribbon for the rosette.
To prevent the edges from fraying, use an anti-frying craft gel or sew the edges by hand using a zigzag stitch.;
, Use a running stitch to gather the ribbon and sew up the back with a backstitch.


To make a running stitch, allow the needle to run along the edge of the ribbon from the front to the back, and then to the front again. Repeat this pattern for the length of the ribbon. Instead of pulling the thread all the way through, allow the ribbon to gather on the needle, creating a ""bunching"" effect.
Your stitches should be even and about 3/8 inch (1 cm) long.
To make a backstitch, pull the thread taut against the ribbon. Push the needle back through to the back, pulling it taut once more. Repeat until the ends are completely sewn together, making your stitches as close together as possible.
Alternatively, you could skip the rosette and decorate your garter with a simple bow made from a small strip of your accent ribbon.

, Repeat the same method used for sewing the base. Attach the accent to the top of the rosette using fabric glue.


Sew the accent using a running stitch to gather the ribbon. Sew the ends together with a backstitch.

, Use your sewing machine to sew the two ribbons together down the center.


Use a thread color that matches your accent ribbon.
Pin the accent ribbon to the exact center of your base ribbon before sewing.
Sew a straight line down the exact center of both ribbons, fixing them together.

, Pin the extra length of base fabric to the back of the garter front. Sew the two together with a sewing machine.


Use thread the same color as your base ribbon.
Sew both edges of the base ribbon, leaving 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) seam allowance on both sides.
Do not sew the rough ends together. You will need to leave these open for the elastic.

, Attach the elastic to a safety pin and push the pin through the tube, pulling the elastic through so that there is about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overhang from both ends.


The elastic band should be 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) wide.

, Sew your elastic together by machine using a zigzag stitch to secure it in place. Use a straight stitch to close the open seam of the garter.


Before stitching it closed, tuck one end of the garter ribbon into the other to hide the extra elastic and the extra ribbon end.

, Glue the rosette over the seam. In the center of the rosette, glue a charm or button that personalizes your garter.


A good choice for a charm would be a school emblem or school pin. You could also use a sparkly football charm or something that appeals only to your personal interests.

Measure and cut your tulle and elastic.,
Sew the tulle together.,
Bunch the tulle.,
Sew the ends together.,
Create an elastic loop.,
Attach the elastic to the tulle.,
Add decorations.",How to Make a Garter for Homecoming2," Measure the wearer's thigh and multiply the number by 0.75. Add 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to this number for a seam allowance.

Use tulle that matches the color of your dress or one of your school colors.
The length of elastic should match this measurement.
You will need to cut three separate strips of tulle, and each length of tulle should be three times as long as this basic measurement.
After cutting the three strips of tulle, stack them and cut them down the center lengthwise. You may need to pin the tulle strips together to make sure that the cuts are even.

, Stack the six strips of tulle and pin the stack in several places along the length. Use a sewing machine to stitch down the center of the tulle.


Set a long stitch length and let the bobbin and needle threads stay long on both ends. Do not back stitch the ends. Back stitching secures the ends in place, but for this project, you need to create a gathering stitch.

, Gently pull one of the long bobbin threads to gather or ""bunch up"" the tulle.

Continue gathering the fabric until it is 2/3 the length of your tulle strips, which should also be two times the length of your original measurement.
Use your fingers to gently maneuver the bunches of tulle along the gathering thread. The bunches should be distributed along the thread evenly.

, Fold the tulle in half widthwise and stitch the ends together by hand or with a sewing machine.

Place the ""right"" or ""top"" sides of the tulle together. Sew a straight line 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) from the end.
Turn the right sides out. You should now have a uniform tulle loop.

, Fold your strip of elastic in half widthwise and sew the ends together 1/4 inch (0.635 cm) from the end.

Use a sewing machine to sew a straight line across the ends. Reinforce the seam by backstitching it.
The ""right"" side or ""top"" side of the elastic should be placed together.
Turn the elastic right-side-out.

, Pin the elastic loop to the tulle loop in four places. Use a sewing machine to stitch down the center of the tulle in a straight line, securing the tulle and elastic together.

Note that the elastic loop will be smaller than the tulle loop.
Set your sewing machine to produce a narrow zigzag stitch.
Gently pull on the elastic lengthwise as you sew. As you pull, the length of the elastic should be made to match the length of the tulle.
Make sure the sew around the entire garter.

, Use fabric glue to attach a charm of your school emblem or mascot to the garter.

You could also glue feathers, craft gems, fake-pearl buttons, or other charms and decorations to the garter. Get creative and decorate it according to your own unique personality.
Attach the decoration over the spot at which the two ends of the tulle ring overlap.

Adjust a lace headband to fit around the wearer's thigh.,
Attach an embellishment to a thin piece of tulle.,
Stitch the tulle and embellishment onto the garter.",How to Make a Garter for Homecoming3," If you use a petite lace headband, you probably will not need to make any adjustments. If you use a standard-size lace headband, you might need to take it in.

You can use a white headband, but you can also try to find one in a color that matches your dress or your school colors.
A petite lace headband is the sort of headband worn by babies and toddlers.
To take the headband in, clip apart and remove the ribbon holding it together. Turn the headband inside-out and fold one end of the lace down until the entire length matches the length the garter needs to be. Line up the fold with the other end and stitch them together using a triple stitch or narrow zigzag stitch. Turn the garter right-side-out again.

, Cut 10 inches (25 cm) of narrow tulle. Fold it together and attach your embellishment with glue.

You should have about eight layers of folded tulle. Even at this thickness, the tulle will be light enough to prevent it from being seen at a distance.
Put a small amount of hot glue in the middle of the tulle before firmly fixing your embellishment on the dot. Let dry.
You could use fake pearls or gems for an embellishment, but for something more themed to homecoming, use a charm of your school mascot or school emblem. You could also attach a football jewelry charm or a small bow made with ribbon in your school colors.

, Hand stitch the tulle onto the center seam of the lace headband to complete your garter.

Trim your tulle down before attaching it. Cut it near the embellishment, leaving just enough to sew into.

Grab your measuring tape.,
Join the two cut edges.,
Sew the top of the tulle at the waistline to prepare for gathering.,
Grab some petersham grosgrain.,
Pull out the buttonhole thread.,
Sew the grosgrain to the tulle with the zigzag stitch.,
Add bias binding to the opposite side of your grosgrain.,
Add a hook and clasp to either of the open sides.",How to Make a Petticoat1," You'll need to measure from your waist to the desired spot on your leg for length and around your waist. The first one will be how long your petticoat is (from waist to knee, say) and the second one gives you the proper length around (it'll bunch up significantly).


Once you have your waist measurement, multiply it by 2 1/2. That's how long your piece of material needs to be. Cut your fabric (tulle or crinoline) with these two measurements in mind.

For the purposes of this article, tulle will be referred to as the fabric.

;
, This will form the base of your skirt shape. Since tulle is rough to the touch, you'll want to use your sewing machine to sew down both sides of the seam, keeping it from being itchy and irritating.


Start from the bottom and go to the top, leaving an opening to step into.

, There are a few ways to do this and if you know of another, by all means use it. Here is one method to get the job done:


Use a buttonhole thread and zig-zag across it, creating a channel to use for gathering later. You may need a special foot on your machine to do this. The thread should be able to be pulled out when you're finished.
Sew from the inside-out; the material will travel better as you sew along the loop if you do it from this side.

, You'll want a length that's long enough for your waist, plus an inch or two (2.5 to 5 cm) for overlap. Place a pin at the mid-point and quarter-points. Do the same to your tulle (this is to make sure your fabric gets spread evenly along the waistband).

, It will force the tulle to gather as you do so. Continue this action until the tulle is gathered to the desired width for your waist. When the pins match up, that's it!


Pin the grosgrain to the top of the tulle at different lengths. For the final pin, wrap the buttonhole thread around it to keep it from moving as you sew.

Pin the tulle evenly to the grosgrain as this will be how it lies when finished.



, Since tulle rips fairly easily, the zigzag is a good stitch to use. Once you've sewn all the way around, remove all the pins. Double-check to see if you've missed any!


If there's any excess tulle above your seam, trim it down with a pair of scissors. It'll be less itchy and less likely to tear.

, This fills out the waistband, reinforces it, and keeps the edge of the tulle from irritating your skin. Just eyeball it as you sew.


You can use a straight stitch for this part. Sew the bias binding at the top and bottom, with a negligible seam on either side.

, Remember how you didn't sew it all the way up at the beginning? That's so you can hook it together as need be. Now's the time to add a hook and clasp and then you're finished!


Whatever style you have at your disposal should work. The grosgrain and bias binding are sturdy enough to support most clasps.
If you'd like ruffles, use the same method you did with the waistband and simply add a long, wide strip to the bottom.

Grab your slip and measuring tape.,
Cut your fabric.,
Stitch each of the strips together across the short ends.,
Set the stitch length on your sewing machine to its longest setting.,
Pull the top threads in each stitch line to gather the top of the petticoat strips to the same size as the slip.,
Pin the widest strip to the slip.,
Subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the strip width base.,
Pin the last strip the same distance above the top of the middle strip.",How to Make a Petticoat2," Measure the width of the slip at the widest point on the hips. Multiply that measurement by 2.5 and add 1 inch (2.54 cm). You will use this as the length of the tulle or crinoline strips. It needs to be considerably wider than your waist to allow for gather.


Once you have that, measure the desired length of your slip and divide it by 4. This will be the width of the first strip (the subsequent strips will be based off of this length (and referred to as the ""width base."")). Pieced together, they will comprise the length of your petticoat. Allow an extra inch (2.5 cm) for seam overlap.
In case you haven't noticed yet, this tutorial uses a slip instead of making your own waistband -- it's a bit easier this way.

, Both crinoline and tulle work -- tulle is puffier but it's also itchy and rough to the touch. Either way, you'll end up with three pieces that are exorbitantly long and ranging for not very wide to marginally wide. The technical terms, if you will.


The first strip should be the strip width base by the strip length.
The second strip should be 2 times the strip width base by the strip length.
The third strip should be 3 times the strip width base by the strip length.

, Use a 1/2-inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance. Your result will be 3 loops of equal length and non-equal width.


Once you've completed this part, zigzag stitch one long edge of each strip to keep it from unraveling. The zigzag stitch is great for reinforcing and preventing tears.

, Make a line of stitching 1/4 inch (.6 cm) from the unfinished long edge of each tulle strip. Using the straight stitch here is fine.


Make a second line of long basting stitches 1/4 inch (.635 cm) from the first. The two parallel lines are strengthening, pleasing to the eye, and aid in gathering.

, What was once 2.5 times the width of your waist should now resemble a human-sized width. They should all be perky and ruffly now!

, Align the top hem of the strip and the bottom hem of the slip to one another. Stitch the strip to the slip with a 1/2"" seam allowance. Again, a straight stitch is appropriate here.


Make sure you pin it on and sew evenly! You don't want it bunched in certain areas and laying flat in others.

, Pin the middle strip that measurement above the top of the strip you attached to the slip. Basically, if your widest strip is 15"" (38 cm), you would have 4"" (10 cm) of it showing at the bottom of your petticoat. Stitch the second strip to your slip using the same method as you did with the first.


Pinning first is always easier and guarantees that your ruffles lay evenly.

, Then, stitch it to the slip using the same method. Your petticoat is now ready to wear under your skirt! Your once boring slip is now frilly and adds volume to any dress!


If it's not ruffly enough for you, simply add another tier. Or three.

Try on the onesie.",How to Make a Onesie," Lay the sweatshirt on a flat surface, and use scissors to cut the threading connecting the sweatshirt pockets to the waistband of the sweatshirt.Make a small snip at the connected threading, making sure not to cut any of the actual sweatshirt fabric.

Once you have cut the thread connecting to pockets to the waistband, gently pull the pockets away from the waistband until the threading comes loose and unravels.;
, Starting at the area right next to the zipper, cut vertically, parallel to the sweatshirt zipper, and then turn the scissors horizontally to cut around the sweatshirt and remove the waistband from the sweatshirt. Try to cut as close to sewn edge of the waistband as possible. Once you cut all the way around the bottom of the sweatshirt and get back to the other side of the zipper, turn your scissors vertically to again, cut right alongside the edge of the zipper. The zipper should look untouched, hanging about an inch or two longer than the cut edge of the bottom of the sweatshirt.It is very important that you leave the zipper intact by cutting along the sides of it. You will use the zipper later to get into the onesie, and if you cut it, it will most likely not function later on.

, Reinforce the portion of the zipper that is hanging from the sweatshirt with some fabric glue.Focus on applying the glue from the height where the waistband had been cut off, and extending a bit below that, toward the base of the zipper closure. The zipper has to be fastened securely, so it won’t unravel later.

You could even use some needle and thread to sew around the zipper for added security.Consider stapling the zipper as well.

, Once the zipper is tightly secured and the glue has had time to completely dry (approximately 2 hours), cut off the remaining zipper extending past the point of the waistband. To be sure that the zipper won’t unravel, add a little bit more glue to the cut off edge of the zipper, and cover it with a small piece of left over fabric.The left over fabric will help keep the rough zipper edge contained, and prevent it from unraveling.
The added fabric will also make the rough zipper edge less irritating while wearing the onesie.

, Just like you did with the sweatshirt, lay the pants on a flat surface and cut off the top waistband on the pants.Be sure to stay as close to the waistband edge as possible., This step is optional, but if you want the bottom of the pant legs to be scrunched and not loose, you can feed elastic into the pant leg hem to cinch the pant leg bottoms.Unravel the fabric elastic and cut off two pieces approximately 8” – 12” long, depending on the circumference of your ankle. Attach a safety pin to one end of each elastic strip.

You can wrap the elastic around your ankle to see how much you need, but always err on the side of caution and cut extra elastic, rather than not cutting enough.

, Use the scissors to make a small incision on the inside hemming of one of the pant legs, big enough that the safety pin and elastic could enter through the slit easily.Use the safety pin to guide the elastic inside the hem, and feed it around the hem of the pant, coming out the other side of the incision., Once the elastic is hanging out of the pant leg from both ends of the incision, use a needle and thread to sew the elastic ends together.The sewing of the elastic doesn’t require a lot of meticulous precision, because it’ll be hidden inside the pant leg hem.
However, do make sure that you sew and secure your stitching, so the elastic doesn’t come loose in the pant hem.

, Use a thread with similar coloring as the sweat suit to sew and close the slit of the hem incision.Again, this closure sewing doesn’t require exact precision, but the stitchings should be secure enough that they won’t unravel later on and expose the elastic.

Repeat this entire process (feeding the elastic through the pant hem, sewing the elastic ends together, and sewing the incision point closed) for the other pant leg.

, Turn the top and bottom of the sweat suit inside out.Moving in small sections, match up the top and bottom edges of the sweat suit, by lying either the top or bottom piece of the sweat suit on top of the other piece., Use sewing pins to fasten the matched edges, and keep them in place.Do this by pushing in a pin down into the matched up fabric (about 1/4 “ away from the fabric’s edge), then tilt and bring the pin back up through the fabric (a centimeter or so over from the entrance point), and even out the pin, so it acts as a skewer. The pins should lie parallel to the edges of the sweat suit.

Weave sewing pins in this manner all around the matched edges of the sweat suit, until both free edges are evenly held in place.

, Use a sewing machine to stitch the edges of the top and bottom pieces of the sweat suit together. You do not have to remove the pins in order to sew the fabrics together; simply sew on the other side of the pins, toward the bulk of the fabric.However, if you are worried about the pins catching the sewing needle and potentially breaking it while you sew, you can remove each pin as you come up on the area of the fabric it's holding together.
You may need to change the sewing machine settings to a “stretch stitch,” to accommodate sewing on stretchy material.If you don’t change the settings, your sewing machine can jam the threading with the fabric.
Do not sew over the zipper.

, Remove all the pins once you are finished sewing, and turn the onesie right side in.At this point, unzip the onesie, step into it, and try it on."

Draw a triangle (for the dart) at the fullest part of the curve (the triangle in this tutorial is 55 degrees, and the sides are 3.5cm long). Ensure that when you fold this dart triangle in half, there is paper hanging off. Check by physically bringing the straight sides of the triangle together. Measure 5 degrees from the top line and draw the line. Fold your pattern in half along the crease line and cut it out.

, Continue to cut two pieces of lining; two pieces of iron-on interfacing; and two pieces of heavy sew-in.

, Make up your pattern for the handle tabs as shown in the photo. From this pattern cut: 2 pieces of silk; 2 pieces of lining; 2 pieces of iron-on interfacing; and 2 pieces of heavy sew-in.

, Iron the iron-on interfacing onto the wrong side of both of the silk pieces. Make a sandwich with the one of the the silk pieces (right side up) on the the bottom, a lining piece (the right side down) in the middle, and a heavy sew-in piece on the top. Pin the sandwich and stitch together leaving a 10 centimeter (3.9 in) gap in one of the long edges. Make notches into the 'V' of the handle tab, and clip off the corners. This will reduce bulk and make for a smoother result when you turn the handle tab right side out. Turn the tab right side out through the gap and press. Repeat for the other bag handle tab.

, Clip off the corners of the point as shown.

,, Take one of the handle tabs and fold it in half (make sure the half or the tab which has the gap in the bottom of it is facing outwards (the exterior side (not the lining) of the bag - this will be sewn shut later.) On the tab half which will face the inside of the bag, find and mark the centre of the tab and push one of magnetic snap parts into the tab so as the make two prong marks/indentations. Using a stitch ripper, make two small cuts into the markings you have just made (don't cut through both halves of the tab, just one half). Take one of the magnetic snap parts and push the prongs through the right side of the tab. Slip a metal washer over the prongs at the back of the tab and then press the prongs down away from each other.

,, Magnetic snaps comprise of 4 parts; 2 washers, and a male and female. Find the centre of the tab, and make prong marks/an indentation by pushing a mag snap part into your fabric. Push the mag snap part into the right side of your tab and slip a washer on the back.

, Iron the iron-on interfacing onto the wrong side of both of the silk pieces (usually it would not be advised to use firm iron-on interfacing on silk but in this case we want the interfacing to make the silk more crunchy because we are after those 'sculptural qualities' for this bag). Take one of the silk exterior pieces (right side up), lay it on the heavy sew-in interlining piece, and treat as one layer. With the silk right side up fold the dart triangle in half and and stitch the dart (with 1 cm seam allowance) as shown in the photo.


Repeat for the other 3 darts. Sew the 4 darts in the lining pieces in the same way.
Fold dart triangles and sew dart as shown in image.

, Pin the 2 exterior halves (with wrong sides out) together. Whilst pinning together, ensure that the dart lines meet each other (so that the darts will run smoothly from the front of the bag to the back). Measure 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from both top edge corners and mark. Starting from one of the markings sew around the sides and bottom of the exterior and stop at the other marking. Turn right side out.


Sew lining bag bag in the same way. Except that you must leave a 15 centimeter (5.9 in) gap in the bottom and do not turn the lining bag right side out.
Measure and mark 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from the top edge on both sides. Sew by following the blue arrow.

, With the right side out, slip the exterior bag into the lining bag. The right sides of the lining and the exterior bag should now be touching each other. Make the 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) markings as in Step 5.


Slip exterior bag into lining bag as shown.
Measure and mark 7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) down from the top edge on the left and right sides of the lining. Sew by following the blue arrow.

, Pop the lining into the exterior bag and smooth everything out. Stitch the gap in the lining shut by tucking the raw edges into the hole and top stitching for a neat finish.


Pull it through. Stitch a hole in the lining, and press.
This should be the result (after a spot of ironing!)

, Mark the centre top edge of the flap with a pin. Pleat the flap as shown in the picture. Hold the pleats in place with paper clips. Important - ensure that after pleating, the flap is the same length as the handle tab casing. This part will take a bit of fiddling and adjustment, so take your time and get it right at this stage. Hand sew a few stitches to keep the pleats in place. Repeat with the other flap.


Look at the front view of pleats. Notice how the outer edges bend upwards? Don't worry about that, just make sure that when you place one of the handle tabs over your pleats (position the tab on the blue line which is 1cm down from the centre top edge) everything lines up nicely - in other words, the bag sides flow up into the handle tabs to create a smooth line. To get the width of the pleats right will take a bit of fiddling about (it would be good to have a cup of tea handy for this bit!). Secure pleats with some paper clips and then with a few hand stitches.
This is how the pleats should look from the lining side.

, Take one of the handle tabs and fold it in half over the pleated purse flap and slip one of the handles onto the tab. Ensure that the mag snap is facing inwards! Because there a quite a few layers to sew through, and this stage is all about positioning the tab correctly over the pleats, we are not going to trust pins to hold everything in place. Instead we are going to glue the tabs onto the pleats and then sew - this will save you a lot of grief!


Slip a handle onto the tab. Apply some fabric glue to the lining side of the handle tab and the top edge of the pleats. Wait for a minute or two and then bond pressing the edges firmly. Repeat for the lining side of the pleats. Be careful to line everything up as best as you can, ensuring that the bottom of the edges of the tab are even on both the lining side and the exterior side of the bag (in other words, one edge should not hang lower than the other). Make sure that you get a nice straight diagonal line from the sides of the bag through to the handle tabs.

, When the glue has dried sew the handle tab onto the pleats 2 or 3 mm from the edge. Ensure that you catch all of the layers as you sew (which, if you positioned everything correctly earlier, everything will be fine). This is where you will sew the gap in the bottom of the tab shut. Take your time! Repeat for the other handle tab.

, Go slowly! It's a bit bulky and awkward but if you take you time you should get a nice straight/ish line. You will find out here that gluing it first just a brilliant idea!

Take careful measurements.",How to Make a Custom Corset Pattern1," You'll need to measure the following:


Bust
Waist: This measurement should be taken at the natural waist, near your bellybutton.
Waist to Underarm Measurement: Starting at your side, measure the distance from your waist to an inch or so beneath the armpit or to the top edge of your bra.
Center Front: This will be the height in the front. A good starting length is 12 inches (30.5 cm), but you may need more or less depending on your back waist length. This length will increase or decrease depending on the style of corset you want as well.;
"
"
Create a one inch grid on either large paper or newsprint.,
Draw a vertical line along the right side of your grid paper.,
Divide your bust measurement by 2.,
Draw a horizontal line connecting from the top edge of your vertical line.,
The next point (let's call this point ""X"") on your pattern will take into account your bra cup size and over all circumference.,
Transfer the distance down from the last step over to the left end of your horizontal line.,
Divide the distance between the front vertical line and the point X into half.,
Connect X, Y and Z.,
Divide your waist measurement in half.,
Bring down the line from point X above until in touches the bottom waistline.,
Draw a line from Y down to M. This is your back seam line.

,
From point N, move up the grid an inch and a half.,
Draw a curve up from M through O back to the bottom of your right hand vertical line.

,
Done.",How to Make a Custom Corset Pattern2," This grid will be your starting point for creating your custom pattern.


Note: you can purchase poster board already grid-lined in one inch increments to use for this purpose if you like.

, Make the vertical line the length of your center front length. (this will be the center front of your corset, use it as the starting place for your remaining pattern.) For example, if the front center length was 12, you would draw a 12 inch (30.5 cm) vertical line.

, For example, if your bust is 36 inches (91.4 cm), 36 divided by two is 18.

, The length of this line should be half your bust measurement. Subtract one more inch from this length. For our example of 36 inches (91.4 cm), half would be 18, one inch less would be 17 inches (43.2 cm).

, You want a point approximately 2/7ths or 28% of your bust measurement to the left. And the point should be down from the top line by two inches plus 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) per cup size. Using a 36C, the point would be 36 divided by .28 over to the left of the original vertical line. The point would be one inch down for an A cup, 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) down for a B cup, and 2 inches (5.1 cm) down for a C cup. (2.5 for a D, 3.0 for a DD, etc) This is the underarm point.

, You can call this point ""Y"".

, Measure that half distance out along your horizontal line from the right side and mark it. Call this point ""Z"".

, Make your line a flowing curve rather than sharply angled. You now have the top edge of your Corset!

, From the bottom of the vertical line on the right, measure out half your waist measurement and mark the end of it. Let's call this point M.

, Mark the point where the line from X intersects the bottom ""waist"" line. Call that intersection ""N"".

,, Mark the point as ""O"".

,, You now have a pattern that you can follow for sewing up your Renaissance Fair corset.

Keep in mind that a simple, basic corset pattern will usually be better for a novice than a complex one. Corsets can be difficult to make, so take it easy on yourself the first time or two around.
You can find corset patterns for free and for sale, but the best kind usually fall into the latter category. You should be able to find an easy to follow corset pattern on the internet or in the sewing department of a craft store.
Alternatively, you can also make a custom corset pattern, but the process involves intricately plotting out your measurements on graph paper.;
, A good pattern has multiple sizes marked on it, ranging usually from 6 to 26. Most patterns allow for 2 inches of ease in the back for lacing up the corset, so don't be alarmed if the pattern seems especially small. Find your size by taking your bust, waist, and hip measurement. Once you have the appropriate size, cut out the pattern.


Wrap a tape measure around the widest part of your bust while wearing a standard bra for your bust measurement.
Find your waist measurement by wrapping a tape measure around the thinnest part of your waist, 2 inches (5 cm) above the navel. The corset is a garment worn to shape your body. Normally, you'll subtract 4 inches (10 cm) from your waist measurement.
The hip measurement can be found by wrapping a tape measure around the widest part of your hips. This is roughly 8 inches (20 cm) below your waist measurement.

, The best material to use for a corset is corset coutil, because it is specifically designed for corsets, 100% cotton so it's breathable, very strong for its weight, and has little give in any direction. If you don't have coutil you can use a sturdy cotton duck (canvas) or quality linen.If you use duck fabric or linen, know that your corset will have more give in the finished product and will likely fit a bit larger than if made from coutil.
You can also add inner lining to your corset for extra comfort. Use a firmly woven cotton or cotton blend and cut and sew the lining following the pattern for the corset.
When you choose thread for your corset, test it first to check the quality of the thread. All-purpose thread should be fine, but before you use it, unravel a length and try to snap it with your hands. If it doesn't break easily it is fine to use, but don't use thread that breaks easily because it will undergo a lot of tension in the corset and you want it to be sturdy.

, Wash and dry the fabric before you use it and iron it flat to remove any wrinkles or folds before cutting the fabric.


Check the grain. If you examine fabric closely you'll see that it has a ""weft thread,"" which is the thread that is horizontal across the fabric, and a ""warp thread"" which intersects the waft thread at a right angle and is vertical across the fabric. These terms are also interchangeable with the terms ""grain line"" and ""cross-grain."" You'll want to cut the fabric along the stretchiest grain line, so stretch the fabric in both directions, determining which direction is more stretchy. Often times fabric will have a red line with arrows showing the grain line, and the perpendicular line to that is the cross-grain., Lay the pattern vertically over the fabric, following the grain line with the most amount of stretch, which is most likely the cross-grain. You should avoid excess stretch encircling your waist. Pin the pattern onto the fabric.You could also use pattern weights, which can be stones or weights that help hold the pattern in place. If you opt for this method, outline the pattern with chalk before cutting. Sometimes this is a better option because it prevents any distortion when cutting the fabric.

, Make sure that you cut the pieces out according to the pattern instructions. Be a perfectionist when doing this, because the fabric needs to be the exact measurements as the pattern, or your corset won't fit correctly.


Depending on the fabric pattern you have, you may need to cut some of the pieces twice. Some patterns require you to cut the center-back pieces twice, the center-front piece once, and all other pieces twice, with all cuts on the fold and with no seam allowance at the back. Follow the pattern's instructions for how many cuts you need to make., Assemble all the pieces as directed according to your pattern's instructions. Pin the pieces in place to prevent them from moving around as you sew.


You could also loosely baste (temporary stitches intended to be removed) the pieces together to accomplish the same result.
If your seams are trued, meaning that they match properly, you might be able to match up the top edges and guide the machine as you form seams without using pins or basting.

, Using a very small straight stitch, stitch your pieces together in order of the pattern. Start from top to bottom and go very slowly down the fabric, making sure the fabric doesn't shift or bunch. When you are finished, you should have two halves of your corset.Make sure when sewing pieces together that you are sewing the right pieces together. It could help to number the pieces on the back with a piece of white chalk.

, Once all the seams have been stitched, you should press them open toward the back. They should lie flat when done.


Trim off excess fabric if necessary to prevent bunching.
Note that you could also press the seams open as you go along.

, You won't be sewing your corset together past this point, you'll be using the busks and grommet area to attach it together, so you'll want all of the edges of your corset to have a nice clean seam.


Make sure not to sew the top and bottom of your corset, as this will be sewn with binding.

, Cut two pieces of waist tape for the two halves of your corset, with no stretch. Lay the waist tape across the line of most tension in your corset (you can figure this out by pulling your corset to find the tension). Sew the waist tape to the seam allowance on the back of your corset, basting it in place along the line of the tape.Waist tape can be twill tape, a sturdy ribbon, or tailor's tape of 5/8 inch or 7/8 inch width. To find the measurements for your waist tape, use your desired waist measurement, add two inches and then divide by two, cutting the two pieces to equal the final measurement.
When sewing your waist tape, make sure it lines up on both halves of your corset by lining up your corset on one side.

, Fold boning casing tape so that the long edges of the tape meet in the center of the backside of the tape. Then, stitch the tape to the center of each corset panel to create 3/8 inch wide boning channels, or if you want less seams on the front of your corset you can stitch it along the already made seams.You can also use 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide strips of fabric if you don't want to purchase casing tape.

, Take the inside of the right side of your corset, draw a stitching line in chalk 5/8 inch from the edge of your corset. Then, line your eye busk (the side with the hooks) up with your sewing line, leaving 3/4 inch from the top edge of your corset, making sure you are looking at the back of the busk. Sew along the busk, attaching it to your corset.


The busk is the piece with the ""eyes or hooks"" that the knobs or pins hook into on the front of your corset to attach it together (and will prevent you from having to untie the lacing on the grommet area each time you want to put on your corset). You can buy busks at a sewing or craft store.

, Taking small metal knobs or pins that fit into your busk holes, line them up with the busk on the right. Then stick them through the left side of the fabric near the edge and connect them completely to the fabric by attaching them with a stitch on the back.

, This is what will close up your corset and hide any ragged edges of the fabric. To use faux leather or real leather as your binding, place clear, water-soluble dressmaking tape along the bottom outside corner of one panel of your corset. Then, press the binding onto the tape, fold it over the edge, and tape to the inside of your corset as well.


You can also use satin, cotton, or another type of pre-made bias binding.

, Use your sewing machine to straight-stitch the taped binding into place.


For now, you should only add binding to the bottom. You need to add your boning to the corset before you can finish the top.

, Measure the length of the bone channels and cut spiral steel flats to the length of your corset leaving about 1/4 inch edge from the top and bottom of your corset, and insert bones into bone channels. You can cut these bones yourself or buy pre-cut bones (which is sometimes much easier).


You can also use spring steel flats, but spiral steel flats will do a better job of following all of the curves of your corset.To prevent rough edges of the bones you can use durable hot glue or craft glue to tip the bones.

, Use the same taping and sewing technique you applied to the bottom edge of the corset to bind the top of the corset with additional, matching binding.

, Space your eyelets/grommets roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart along both sides of the back of your corset, near the edge. As you reach the waist, space four pairs of eyelets more closely together by about 1/4 inch (1/2 cm). You can buy these at a local craft or sewing store.Grommets are the holes in the back of your corset in which you lace up your corset.
Use a fabric punch, leather punch, or awl to punch the holes out for your eyelets.
Hammer the eyelets in place from both sides with a rubber hammer.

, Start at the top and lace the corset down to the waist using a crisscross pattern. Work from the bottom up in the same manner, again stopping at the waist. Tie your laces together at the waist in ""bunny ear"" or ""tennis shoe"" style.


You need about 5 yards (5 m) (4.5 m) of lacing total.
Ribbon and twill are the most historically accurate forms of lacing, but flat lacing and cable cord hold up better in the long-term.

, The top of the corset should begin just above the nipple area, and the bottom should extend over your hips without riding up.


Cinch the waist of the corset in by pulling the loops at the waist.

, You can use a color that matches the color of your fabric, or a contrasting one for a more interesting design. Do this for both pieces of fabric., Pin the fabric pieces together, with the right sides facing inward. Starting just below the casing, sew all the way around the side, bottom, and side edges of the bag, using a ⅝-inch (0.59-centimeter) seam allowance.Leave a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide gap at each bottom corner. If you forget to do this, that's okay. Simply use a seam ripper to undo some of the stitching at each bottom corner. You'll be using these gaps to slide the cording through.

, Use something thin, such as a pair of scissors, a chopstick, or knitting needle to push out the seams first. This will give you a neater finish. Be sure to press all the side edges as well as the top casing., Attach a safety pin to one of the 58-inch (147.32-centimeter) long cords.

, Take the two cords on the left side of the bag, and knot the ends together. Repeat this with the two cords on the right side of the bag., Pull the left cord through the left gap, and the right cord through the right gap. The knots should be resting just outside the seam., Be sure to go back and forth over the gap a few times to hold the cords in place. Use a ⅝-inch (0.59-centimeter) seam allowance as before.

A zigzag stitch will be the best for this., It is now ready to use! To close the back, simply scrunch the top of the bag shut along the cord. Use the two cords as straps. Keep in mind that this bag is delicate, and that it won't hold up to heavy things, like text books."

Shoulder straps: two 10 by 66-centimeter (3.94 by 25.99-inch) strips
Handle strap: one 10 by 24-centimeter (3.94 by 9.45-inch) strip

, Pin the two flap pieces together, with the right sides facing in. Use a glass and a pen to draw the curves first, then cut them out with a pair of scissors., Sew along both of the side edges and the curved, bottom edge. Leave the top, straight edge open, so that you can turn the flap inside out.

Cut little notches into the curved edges. Be careful not to cut into the stitching. This will help reduce bunching and bulk when you turn the flap inside-out.

, After you turn the flap inside out, use something thin and slender, like a pair of scissors, a chopstick, or a knitting needle, to push out the curves. Press the edges of the flap down with an iron using a heat setting suitable for the fabric. When you are done, topstitch all the way around the flap, about 6 millimeters (0.24 inches) from the edge.You can use a matching thread color, or a contrasting one.

For a fancier touch, pin some bias tape all the way around the edges, then top stitch it down.
You can topstitch the top, raw edge this time around, if you want to.

, Turn the strips so that the wrong sides are facing you. Fold and press each of the long edges by 1 centimeter (0.4 inch). Do this for both of the shoulder straps and the handle strap.Leave the narrow edges alone., Fold each of the strips in half, lengthwise. The folded edges should now be on the inside, and the right-side of the fabric should now be on the outside. Pin the edges in place, then topstitch along them, about 6 millimeters (0.24 inch) away from the edge. Do this for both of the shoulder strap pieces and the handle strap., Pin the two body pieces together, with the right sides facing each other. Starting from the top-left corner, stitch down 5 centimeters (1.97 inches) along the long edge. Leave a 3-centimeter (1.19-inch) long gap, then continue sewing the rest of the way down to the bottom corner. Repeat for the right side.Use a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance.
Do not sew along the bottom edge of the bag.

, An easy way to do this is to turn the body piece inside out, and turn it so that one of the seams is on the ironing board. Run the iron through the tube, pressing the seam allowances open and flat. Repeat this for the other seam allowance, then turn the back inside out again so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you., Fold and press the top edge of the bag down by 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) first. Then, fold it down by 4 centimeters (1.58 inches), and press it again.Make sure that you are folding evenly all the way around the top edge of the bag., Sew as close to the bottom edge as you can—about 6 millimeters (0.24 inch). seam allowance. Use a color that matches your fabric; for a more interesting design, use a contrasting color. When you are done, turn the back inside out, so that all of the seams are on the inside, and the right side of the fabric is facing you., Make sure that the bag is turned inside-out first, so that the right side of the fabric is facing you. Then:

Pin the shoulder straps 13 centimeters (5.12 inches) apart, just below the casing. The top edges should be facing top of the bag, and the bottom edges should be facing the bottom of the bag.
Pin the ends of the handle strap between the shoulder straps. The ends of the handle should be facing the top of the bag, and the loop of the handle should be facing the bottom of the bag.

, Position the flap so that the top, raw edge is just below the casing, and aligned with the raw edges of the straps. The raw edge should facing the top of the bag, and the curved edge should be facing the bottom of the bag., Use a 1-centimeter (0.4-inch) seam allowance both times., Make sure that you are only pinning them to the back of the bag. Do not pin them through both layers of fabric, or you won't be able to attach the base., Fold the base into fourths. Use a glass to trace a curve on top of the loose (not folded) corner. Cut along the line that you drew, then unfold the base. You'll get a rounded rectangle., Turn the bag inside-out so that the wrong side of the fabric is facing you. Pin the base to the bottom of the bag. The long edges of the base should be at the front/back of the bag. The short edges of the base should be at the sides of the bag.

, Find the top center of your back panel. Measure down 4 to 4½ inches (10.16 to 11.43 centimeters), then cut straight across. You will end up with two pieces: a curved top piece and a rectangular bottom piece. The top piece will be referred to as ""Part A."" The bottom piece will be referred to as ""Part B."", Make sure that the right side of the fabric is facing you, then place the shoulder straps on top. They need to be about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to cc centimeters) away from the side edges. Make sure that the top edges of the straps are aligned with the straight, top edge of Part B, and that you are pinning the straps to the right side of the fabric., Make sure that the bottom, straight edge of Part A is aligned with the top, straight edge of Part B.

Baste the zipper on top of the seam. Make sure that wrong sides of the fabric and zipper are facing you; the right side of the zipper should be facing the seam.It may seem like you won't be able to use the zipper because of the seam. Don't worry, you will open the seam later so that you can use the zipper.

, Sew the left and right sides of the zipper down first, then the top and bottom. Be sure to sew across the top and bottom a few times so that it is nice and strong., Turn the zipper panel so that the right side of the fabric is facing you. Find the top and bottom stitching for the zipper. Open the seam between those two spots using a seam ripper. You should now be able to open and close your zipper!

Be careful not to rip the top and bottom stitching that are holding the zipper in place.

Gather your materials.,
Cut your fabric.,
Sew the sides of the square piece together.,
Fold over the edges.,
Turn the case inside out.,
Glue or sew the edges of your strip of fabric.,
Attach the band to the case.,
Measure the band and cut off excess fabric.,
Stick Velcro onto the ends of the band.,
Use your pencil case.",How to Make a Bow Pencil Case," Making a bow pencil case is easy as long as you have the necessary materials. Before you get started, you will need:








some fabric (any color or pattern you want)
needles and thread or a sewing machine
a glue gun with glue sticks
scissors
a ruler or measuring tape
Velcro;
, You will need to cut out two pieces to create a bow pencil case. First, take your fabric and cut it into a square that is a few inches longer than a pencil. Start with a 12-inch by 12-inch square and trim it down more if desired. Then, cut a long narrow strip of the same fabric or of a different fabric that you want to use. This piece of fabric will need to be about 10 inches long and three inches wide.








To get the right measurements for your square piece, you can also hold a pencil next to the material and cut the fabric so that it is a couple inches wider than the pencil on all sides

, Next, you will need to sew up the sides of your material to create a pouch. Fold your square piece in half and use your needle and thread or your sewing machine to sew the two shortest sides. Sew about an inch away from the edge of the fabric to ensure that you have a strong seam. When you are finished, you will have a small pouch.








Before you sew, you may want to slip a pencil in between the fabric to make sure that you leave plenty of room for your pencils.
Make sure that you sew the sides and do not glue them. It is okay to use glue for other minor details of this pencil cases, but you should not glue the main seams of the pouch because they will be more prone to tears. Sewing will ensure a longer lasting, stronger seam than gluing., Next, fold over the edges of your pouch so that about an inch of fabric is hanging over on all sides. Take your hot glue gun and use it to secure this edge all around your pouch. This will ensure that you have a nice even seam around the top of your pencil pouch.








Only glue a small area of fabric at a time and press the fabric together as you apply the hot glue. Make sure that you hold the hot glue gun close to the fabric as well, or it may dry before it reaches the fabric.You can also sew the edges together if you prefer.
If you do not have hot glue, then you can use fabric glue, but you will need to leave it to dry overnight.

, After you have glued or sewn the top edge of the pouch, turn the pouch inside out. You should not have any visible fabric edges after you turn the pouch inside out.








If you glued the edges, make sure that they are dry before you turn the fabric inside out.

, Next, you will need to fold over and either glue or sew the edges of your strip of fabric. Take the fabric and lay it out flat, then take one of the long sides and fold it in towards the center. Glue the underside of this piece to secure it. Then, fold over the other side of the fabric and glue the underside of this fabric as well.








You can also sew the two edges of the strip together and then turn the strip inside out if you prefer.
If you do not have hot glue, then you may also use fabric glue, but you will need to let the glue dry overnight. You may also want to place a heavy book over the fabric to ensure that fabric stays stuck together as the glue dries.

, Next, take one end of the band and use your hot glue gun to attach it to the center of your pouch, near the bottom. The rest of the band will need to come up and over the top of the pouch, so make sure that you attach the band with this in mind.








Do not apply any hot glue to the other side of the pouch. This side needs to be loose so that you can adjust it to look like a bow when the pouch is closed.

, After the glue has dried, take your fabric band and wrap it around the center of your pouch so that it crosses over the pouch opening. Then, adjust the band to determine where you will need to trim it.








Keep in mind that the band should be loose enough to allow your pencils to fit inside the pouch, but tight enough to create a bow effect. Try adjusting the fabric to see what length works best.
When you have found the ideal length, trim off the excess fabric.

, Next, take your Velcro and hot glue gun. Use the glue gun to apply one piece of Velcro to the end of the band that you glued to the pouch. Then use your glue gun to attach the other piece of Velcro to the other end of the band.








Make sure that you place the Velcro so that the two pieces will be able to connect.
If you are using fabric glue, then press down the pieces with a heavy book and leave them to dry overnight.

, When you have finished attaching your Velcro, put your pencils into the pencil case and secure the band. Then, flip over the case and adjust the material on the other side to make it look more like a bow. Your bow pencil case is now complete!

Complete the first side and add the next one.,
Repeat the same process for the other side.",How to Make a Lunch Box," Before you touch scissors to fabric, you'll first have to choose the kind of fabric you'll be using. The printed fabric will make up the most visible part of your lunch box, and the accent fabric will be used for a pocket. Sturdy fabrics, like linen or some kind of cotton blend, should be prioritized, as these will hold up better to wear and tear.In all, for the printed fabric and vinyl, you'll need about 15"" by 50"" (38.1 by 127 cm) of material. For the accent fabric, you'll only need about 5"" by 5"" (12.7 by 12.7 cm) of material.
Your imagination is the limit when you're choosing fabrics. For kids, you might want to choose themed fabrics, such as dinosaur or princess prints.
You should be able to purchase themed or patterned fabrics at your local craft or hobby store.
Avoid vinyl with cloth backing. The vinyl will line the inside of your lunch box to protect the fabric if something spills.;
, Your lunch box will be made of a single piece of fabric that has been lined with vinyl on the inside. Two smaller pieces will close off the sides of your lunch box. To make these pieces, you'll need to:


Measure 25½"" by 7"" (64.87 cm by 17.8 cm) on the vinyl and fabric with a ruler, then cut these free with scissors.
Use a ruler to measure and use the scissors to cut two pieces that are 8¼"" by 4"" (21 cm by 10.2 cm) from both the fabric and vinyl.
You can ensure straighter cuts by using chalk to mark out the dimensions of the fabric pieces., Many lunch boxes have a small pocked in the front for the sake of convenience. You can make your lunch box a pocket by using scissors to cut a 4"" by 4"" (10.2 cm by 10.2 cm) square from both your accent fabric and vinyl.







, The top of the lunch box will need a strip of Velcro to serve as a fastener, but it'll also need a handle to make it easier to carry. To make these parts:


Cut two pieces of Velcro that are 3½"" (8.9 cm) long.
Cut two pieces of ribbon that are both 7½"" (19 cm) long., For each fabric piece you have, you should also have a vinyl piece. Attach the cloth and vinyl pieces together by laying the vinyl on a clean drop cloth, spraying it with adhesive, then pressing the fabric into place atop the vinyl.









Spray adhesive can create a big mess if you're not careful. A clean drop cloth will protect your work surface and prevent glue from spreading around your work area.
The fumes that come off some spray adhesives can be harmful to your health. Make sure the area you do your gluing is well ventilated to prevent the build up of dangerous fumes.
Smooth the fabric with your fingers so it lies flat against the vinyl. To prevent bunching, you may want to smooth it starting from one side to the opposite.
Longer pieces can be difficult to glue while keeping the fabric and vinyl in alignment. Try rolling up longer fabric pieces and unrolling them onto the vinyl. In this way, you can glue long pieces a little bit at a time., Sewing together the component parts of your lunch box before the glue is completely dry could cause the seal between the two to weaken. Different brands of glue will have different recommended dry times. Follow the glue manufacturer's instructions for best results.









If you're unsure about how long you should allow the glue to dry, you may want to allow it to dry overnight, as many glues set within 8 to 10 hours., Lay out the 25½"" by 7"" (64.87 cm by 17.8 cm) piece of fabric, which at this point should be glued to an equal sized piece of vinyl, pattern side up on your work space. Use a ruler to measure 7"" (17.8 cm) inward from one of the short edges of the fabric. Then:


Use a chalk to mark this 7""-mark close to the middle of the fabric. This mark will be where the top of the pocket is.
Use a ruler to center the pocket so that it has an equal amount of free space on either end of the short side of the fabric.
You might have an easier time sewing these parts together if you hold accent pieces, like the pocket, handle, and velcro in place with pins., Above the mark you've made with the chalk for the top of the pocket, you're going to mark the placement of the first piece of Velcro. Do so ¾"" (1.9 cm) before the short edge of the piece on its vinyl side. Mark the position of the second piece of Velcro 3½"" (8.9 cm) inward from the side opposite the first Velcro piece.


Both pieces of Velcro should be centered so that the margins around the Velcro are equal.
The long side of the Velcro pieces should be parallel with the short ends of the piece of fabric/vinyl, the short side of the Velcro will be in line with the long side of your fabric/vinyl.
You may want to use pins to hold the Velcro in its proper place while sewing., This is a nice little touch that will really make your lunch box look professional, though this isn't absolutely necessary. Take the pocket and sew a border 1/8"" (.32 cm) from its outside edge with a sewing machine.


If you don't have a sewing machine, you can always hand sew your lunch box, though using a sewing machine generally yields a sturdier end product., You'll be sewing the pocket onto the large piece of fabric/vinyl on all sides except the top. You'll want to leave the top open so you can easily slip items into it. Use the sewing machine to attach the pocket to the fabric/vinyl.









The top left and right sides of the pocket will experience more wear and tear, so you may want to add some reverse stitches to reinforce the sides., The Velcro fasteners should already be in place, one on the pattern side of the fabric and the other on the vinyl side. While sewing the Velcro onto the large fabric/vinyl piece, stitch as closely to the edges of the Velcro as possible, around its entire perimeter.









Before sewing on the Velcro, it's a good idea to fold the fabric/vinyl piece to make sure that the fasteners can connect and are centered., Using three lines of stitches, you'll be connecting the two pieces of ribbon to make a handle. Since ribbon can be glossy or slide around when you're sewing, you may want to hold the pieces together with pins while sewing. Holding the doubled ribbon so the long side is directly in front of you:









Sew one line of stitches 1/8"" (.32 cm) from the top, the second directly down the center of the ribbon, and the third 1/8"" (.32 cm) from the bottom., The left and right sides of the ribbon handle will be ¾"" (1.9 cm) margin between it and the edge of the fabric/vinyl and 4½"" (11.4 cm) from its top. When sewing the ribbon to the fabric/vinyl:









Attach both ends of the handle by sewing a 1"" (2.5 cm) box to connect handle and fabric/vinyl. By sewing in this shape, you'll make the handle sturdier.
In some cases, the sewing machine may cause some loose threads to form in the ribbon. Use scissors to trim these and make a more professional looking handle.
The ribbon will be longer than the width of the fabric/vinyl piece. Due to this, you'll need to bunch the ribbon at the middle so that the sides of the handle can be sewn in the correct place., Lay all three fabric/vinyl pieces pattern side up on your work space. You'll be attaching the two small pieces to the long sides of the big one, starting from the side opposite the handle. Do this by:









Turning the large piece so the vinyl side is facing up. Lay either one of the small pieces so its outside edges are even with the outside edges of the large piece.
Sew the outside edges together. You may want to add some reverse stitching to strengthen the seam.
Leave ¼"" (.64 cm) free at the corner of the small piece that is closest to the handle side of the large piece., You're going to need to continue sewing the outer edge of your smaller fabric/vinyl piece so that the large piece wraps around it, meeting it edge to edge all the way around. The ¼"" (.64 cm) free space you left should allow you to:


Fold the long edge of the large fabric/vinyl piece in an L-shape so it matches the edges of the smaller piece to form a corner of your lunch box.
Continue folding the large piece to meet the remaining edges of the smaller piece.
Whenever a corner is formed, leave ¼"" (.64 cm) free, giving you enough slack to bend the large piece around the smaller one.
After you have matched the edges of the large and small piece, begin your next round of stitching by closing off the free space left in the corner.
By using pins to hold large and small pieces together, you'll be able to sew much neater, cleaner lines for the sides of the bag., Your lunch box should be taking shape at this point. All you have to do is repeat the process of stitching the outer edges together of the large piece and the sole remaining small piece.









Once you have finished the second side, your lunch box is ready to be used and shown off."

If you don't know how to sew, you can use fabric glue or hot glue instead.If you are sewing it by hand, you can use a simple straight stitch or a blanket stitch.
If you used fabric glue, hold the edges shut with clothespins or binder clips until the glue dries.

, This is not absolutely necessary, but it will help give your pouch a nicer finish. If you used a blanket stitch, don't trim the sides down, or you'll cut through the stitching., At this point, you can topstitch along the top, folded edge to help hold the flap down.You can also simply press it flat with an iron., If you don't have any fusible webbing, skip this step.

Each brand of fusible webbing will be a little different, so be sure to follow the instructions on the package.

, Draw a tooth shape on the back of the felt, where the webbing is. It need to be about 2 by 2 inches (5.08 by 5.08 centimeters). Cut the tooth out when you are done., Avoid using too much glue, of the glue will soak through the felt., Place your tooth inside the bag and fold the top flap shut.

It can be as large or small as you'd like, but working with flowers smaller than about two inches across will be difficult. Around 4"" will work well. Cut along the line. Then use the first flower shape to trace the same shape on four to nine other pieces of fabric. Cut out all the flower shapes.To draw a flower shape, start with a circle, then draw half circles around the circle. If you want, you can print out and use of the templates provided here http://www.oneprojectcloser.com/make-fabric-flowers-tutorial/.
How many flower shapes of fabric you use depends on how thick the fabric you're using is. Make fewer when using thicker fabric.

, Cut out a small circle of fabric. If you cut your flower shapes around 4"" wide, a 2"" inch wide circle will do. Place a dot of hot glue in the center of the circle.

, Fold one of the flower shapes in half. Place the edge of the flower on the dot of hot glue so that when the flower is unfolded it is centered on the circle

, For each of the other flower shapes, place another dot of hot glue in the center of the flower, fold the flower shape in half, and place it on the hot glue. Rotate the base slightly in between gluing each flower shape so that the shapes aren't aligned. Stop before you use the last two of your flower shapes.

, For the final two flower shapes, fold them in half, then push the two outer edges inward so that they touch. Do this with both of the last flower shapes. Then glue them to the center of the flower., If your fabric rose is lying a little flat, you can use your fingers to ruffle and wrinkle the petals. That way it looks more flower-like.

Leave 1 end open and turn the fabric around, so the right side is showing.,
Take a needle and thread and stitch up the last side.",How to Make Gifts from Old Sweaters3," Put the sweaters in the washing machine at a high temperature, with soap. Dry them on high heat, and you have your felted sweaters., This will give you large pieces of raw material from which to choose your design., For example, you may want to use part of a body pillow or a floor pillow for a large pet. You can probably use a normal head pillow for a cat or small dog., You may need to tape a few pieces of paper together to get the entire measurement of the pillow. Cut the paper to the exact size of 1 half of the pillow, fitting it to the curves of the sides., For an interesting look, experiment with making your squares different sizes and shapes - small, thin, thick, rectangular and square., Cut out any excess material that goes over the paper piece., Place the side you want to show in toward the center and pin, so that you are stitching on the side that will not show. You will want to leave approximately a 1/8-inch (0.3 cm) seam on each piece., You will need to go back to your pattern and continue pinning and sewing new rows, until your patchwork pet bed is completely sewn together. You may want to do it 1 square at a time, to ensure you follow your pattern.,, You may want to do stripes or do a simple 1 or 2 color combination across the back, because it will show less than the front side., Pin through both layers at about 1 inch (2.54 cm) from the edges. Sew up your rectangle at 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) from the edges, back stitching at the corners., Slip the pillow into the patchwork case., You can also affix a zipper to either edge of the last open side for easy washing."

Use as needed.",How to Make a Cooler," You will need three types of material: an insulating material, a waterproof material, and an outer material.


Thermal batting is the best insulating material, but if you're on a budget, you can recycle thin flexible foam or bubble wrap.Craft foam and packing foam can also work but will create a stiffer cooler.
Laminated/coated cotton, PUL lining, and vinyl are your best options for waterproof materials. If you're sticking with recycled materials, though, you could use thin plastic sheets, plastic table cloths, or plastic shower curtains.
The outer material can be the same as your waterproof material, but you could also choose something different. Pick a fairly durable material, like canvas or denim.;
, You will need to cut three rectangles from each of your three materials.


The large rectangle will need to be 10 inches by 26.5 inches (25.4 cm by 67.3 cm). Make sure that you cut out a rectangle with these dimensions from your insulating material, outer material, and waterproof material.
The other two rectangles are smaller but should be equal in size to each other. These rectangles should be 6.5 inches by 10 inches (16.5 cm by 25.4 cm).

, Spread out the large rectangular section of outer material so that the right side faces up. Lay one smaller rectangle of outer material right side down, aligning it to the upper right edge of the larger rectangle. Pin in place.


The larger rectangle is the “main section” of the cooler and the smaller rectangles are the “side panels.”
The long sides of both the main section and side panel should be positioned at the top and bottom; the short sides should be to the left and right.
The upper right corner of the side panel should fall inside the upper right corner of the main section. In other words, no part of the side panel should fall outside the perimeter of the main section.

, Stitch down the long edge of the side panel, partially attaching it to the long edge of the main section.


Use a seam allowance of 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
Begin at the corner edge and work your way inward. Stop 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) away from the left edge of the side panel piece. This excess material will make it easier to bend the material in the next step.

, Fold up the right side of the main piece until the short left edge of the side panel lies flat on top of it. Pin this short edge of the side panel to the top edge of the main section beneath it.


Use your fingers to smooth out the material at the bend between your long and short sides.

, Sew the side panel and main piece together along this short edge using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


Start as close to the previously stitched edge as possible.
As before, stop stitching once you are within 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) of the loose edge of the side panel.

, Turn the main piece over so that the remainder of the top edge meets with the loose long edge of the side panel. Pin the two edges together.


If done correctly, the two edges should end at the same point.

, Stitch down this final side to finish the first side panel.


Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.
Start stitching as close to the end of the previous side as possible and continue stitching all the way down to the end of this final side.

, You will need to sew the second side panel (small rectangle) to the other long side of the main section in the same manner.


Since the main piece is no longer perfectly flat, doing this might be a little trickier. Follow the same basic steps, though.
Keep the right sides of the main section and side panel together.
Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance on all sides.
Pin one long side in place, then sew it on. Pin one short side in place, then sew it on. Finish the panel by pinning the other long side in place, then sew it on.

, Before you can sew the different panels in place, you need to loosely hold the insulating material and waterproof materials together.


Spread out the waterproof material with the right side down and the wrong side up.
Lay the insulating material down on top of the waterproof material. This material will not be visible in the final product, so it doesn't matter whether it is right side up or right side down.
Make sure that all four edges match, then pin the two materials together around all four sides.
You should do this separately with each of your rectangles. In other words, you should pin together the main (large) insulating piece and the main (large) waterproof piece, then pin together one side (small) insulating piece and one side (small) waterproof piece, then the final side (small) insulating piece and the final side (small) waterproof piece.

, Loosely stitch around all four edges of all three sections, sewing by hand or by machine.


Your basting stitches should have a seam allowance of 1/4 inch (0.6 cm).
You do not need to stitch the pieces down securely at this point, but your basting stitches do need to be sturdy enough to hold the layers together.
If you don't want to baste the pieces together, another option would be to evenly and lightly apply spray adhesive in between the separate layers. Spray the adhesive onto the wrong side of the waterproof layer and carefully press the insulating material on top. Let dry before continuing., Follow the same procedure you used with sewing the first side panel of outer material to the main section of outer material (review the “Assembling the Outer Cover” section).


Flatten out the main inner section with the right side of the waterproof material facing up. The insulating material should face down.
Line up the right corner of the side panel with the right corner of the main section. The waterproof layer should face down and the insulating material should face up.
Pin and sew the first long edge of the side panel in place using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.
Rotate the main section so that you can pin and sew one short edge of the side panel and the other long edge of the side panel in place. Continue along with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.
When all three sides of the side panel have been stitched on, this panel is complete.

, You will need to attach the other side panel to the main section in the same manner. Make sure that the waterproof sides face each other and the insulating layers face out.


Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance around all sides.
Once this panel is attached, the inner section of your cooler is complete.

, Turn the inner lining right-side out but keep the outer cover inside-out. Then, slide the outer cover into the inner lining.


The two pieces should fit together snugly. Make sure that all four edges around the opening match up. The stitched edges of the side panels should also line up.

, Fold all four edges down by 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). Pin in place.


Since the three layers of material will be thick, you may need to press the folded edge of the hem with an iron to help hold it in place, especially if the sewing pins are not holding well.
The edge should be folded in so that the raw edge is visible from the waterproof layer but not from the outer material layer.

, Stitch the hem in place using a sewing machine. Make the stitch line as close to the raw edge of the hem as possible.


A zig-zag stitch placed along the raw edge works best, but a standard straight stitch could also be used.
Overlap your beginning and ending stitches to help secure the thread.

, With the outer and inner layers now attached, flip all of the material right-side out.


The “right” side of the outer cover should be visible from the outside.
When you peek inside the cooler, you should be able to see the waterproof layer but should not be able to see the insulating layer.

, Cut two strips of 1-inch (2.5-cm) self-adhesive Velcro. Each strip should measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.


You'll use the Velcro to give your cooler a sealing mechanism. To separate pieces will create a better seal than one long piece would.
Keep both sides of each strip (the fuzzy side and the spiky side) sealed together as you attach them to the cooler.

, Peel off the paper backing from the spiky side of one strip. Press the adhesive side of that strip to the open edge of the cooler. Repeat with the second Velcro strip.


Both strips should be placed roughly 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) down from the open edge.
Both strips must also be attached to the long edge of the opening, not to the short edges.
The first strip should be placed 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) in from the left side. The second strip should be placed 1.5 inches (3.75 cm) in from the right side.

, Peel off the paper backing from the fuzzy side of both Velcro strips. Carefully fold together both long edges of the cooler opening, keeping them aligned with one another. Press the opposite edge into the Velcro adhesive using your fingers.


Work slowly to make sure that the placement of the Velcro strips line up evenly along both long sides of the opening.

, You should be able to open and close the cooler using the Velcro. The cooler itself can now be used to carry drinks and other small items that need to be kept cool.


Thanks to the waterproof lining, you can use both ice and cool packs in your cooler. Be aware of the fact that water from any melted ice can leak out from the top opening if you accidentally tip it over, though.

Measure the area where your Draft Dodger will be placed (along the bottom of a door, the inside ledge of the window, etc.).,
Select fabric and thread.,
Cut your fabric the same length as the inside of the bottom edge of your window (or along the bottom edge of your door), plus 1 1⁄4 inches (3.2 cm) to allow for a 5⁄8 inch (1.6 cm) seam X 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm) wide.

,
With the ""right"" sides of the fabric facing, fold the fabric length-wise and pin it together along the open edges, placing the pins about 4"" apart.,
On the sewing machine, sew one end and the long side of the tube closed, using a 5/8"" seam.,
Turn the tube right-side-out.,
Stuff the tube.,
Close the tube.,
Admire your work and place your Draft Dodger where it will serve its purpose!",How to Make a Draft Dodger," This will help you determine how much fabric you will need. The average amount is about 36"" x 8"" - about a quarter of a yard.;
, Select a fabric that's a little on the heavy side. Corduroy, denim, upholstery fabrics (one leg of a pair of denim jeans is just about perfect). Select thread that is compatible with the fabric weight and color you've chosen.

,, You now have a pinned, rectangular ""tube"" that is inside-out.

, Do NOT sew both ends closed. Remove ALL pins.

, Begin at the closed end of the tube. Insert the handle end of a spoon or other blunt-ended tool (even a pencil will do) into the closed end. This can be a little tricky to get started. Working with your fingers, manipulate the tool through the full length of the tube until the spoon brings the closed end out the open end. Now you have an open-ended tube that is right-side out.

, Using a dowel, (broom handle, yardstick, etc.) fill the tube with chunks of stuffing; a little at a time. Push each ""chunk"" as far as it will go each time. Leave enough room at the open end to form a 5/8"" seam. (TIP: When using pourable filling materials, like kitty litter or sand, use a funnel to pour into the Draft Dodger--leaving one inch unfilled at the top.)

, Carefully fold the raw edge of the open end of the tube towards the INSIDE of the tube to form a neat edge for hemming. Pin it closed. Using a needle and thread or on the sewing machine, stitch the end closed.

, You'll be amazed at the difference it makes!

Stock up on 4 to 7 shirts for the first month in size 0 to 3 months. Buy a few simple shirts that have buttons along the shoulder, or opt for tee shirts and turtlenecks that have larger neck holes.


Ask friend and family members if they have any hand-me-downs that they would be willing to pass along to you.;
, Speed up diaper changes by dressing your baby in pull-over pants or leggings. Buy pants with elastic bands, and look for pants that are fastened with Velcro or easy-to-open pop buttons.Keep 5 to 7 pairs of pants on hand during the first month.

Plan to have 6-8 sleepsuits and 6-8 bodysuits during the first month.Babies grow very quickly, and although it may seem like a lot of clothing to have at home, you will be thankful for the selection when some are dirty or are in the wash.


Store a variety of hassle-free bodysuits and sleepsuits, including a few long-sleeved and a few short-sleeved options.Stock suits that will fit a 0-3 month-old infant., Dressing your baby in layers not only makes a diaper change more efficient, but it will also help you regulate your child’s temperature. Babies lose heat more rapidly than adults do.Keep a sweater or a cardigan on hand to easily warm up your baby if they are cold. If your baby was born during the winter months, plan to stock up on 2 or 3 of these warmer items.


Look for sweaters that have buttons down the front so you do not have to struggle placing the sweater over your child’s head., It is important to protect your child’s head from both the cold weather and the heat. In the winter, have a warm cap or a winter hat to ensure that your baby does not lose heat through the top of their head. In the summertime, make sure your 1-month old has a wide-brimmed hat to protect them from the sun’s harmful rays., Your newborn will need 3-4 pairs of socks and booties to keep their feet warm and protected.Socks are easily lost and kicked off, so be sure to have some extra pairs around during the first month.

Use the cloth diaper the next time your baby needs a change.",How to Make Cloth Diapers," Making cloth diapers is not difficult, but you will need some special tools and materials to do it. To create your own cloth diapers, you will need:flannel material
microfiber towels
precision knife
cutting mat
sewing machine
serger (optional);
, Lay one of your microfiber towels over your flannel fabric and then cut the flannel so that it is the same size as your microfiber towel. You will need two pieces of flannel material to go on the outside of the microfiber towels, so cut out two pieces of flannel., Next, lay down a piece of flannel material pattern side down. Then, lay down three microfiber towels over this piece of flannel. Then, complete the fabric sandwich by placing another piece of flannel pattern side up on top of the microfiber towels.








Pin the materials together in several places to keep them in place when you sew them. Make sure that the pins go through all of the layers of material.

, Next, sew across the layers of fabric that you just pinned together. Sew several parallel lines across the fabric to keep it in place. Sew slowly to ensure that you do not end up with any bumps or uneven spots.








Make sure to avoid the serged edges of the microfiber towels. They may break your needle if you try to sew through them.
Remove the pins as you sew.

, Sewing through already serged edges may break your needle. To avoid breaking your needle on the serged edges of the microfiber towels, you will need to cut off the outer edges of your microfiber and flannel material square.








Use your cutting mat and precision knife to cut off these edges.
You can also use a ruler or other straight edge to ensure that that you cut the fabric evenly.

, Use a ruler to measure the squares into four-inch wide strips. Then, cut the pieces into these strips. You should be able to create three strips out of each square. Each of these strips can be used as a diaper insert.







, It is important to serge or zigzag stitch the edges of the strips to prevent them from fraying and to make them last longer. Take your strips one at a time and serge across the edges or use a zigzag stitch if you do not have a serger.








If you have cloth diapers and just needed some inserts, then your project is finished! However, if you need the outer cloth part of the diapers, then you will need to make these next.

, Flannel cloth diapers are popular because the fabric is soft, but you can also choose terry, twill or a soft jersey or cotton blend. You will need a fabric for the outside and a fabric for the inside, so buy at least a yard (0.9 m) of each.


To save money, you can also use old flannel sheets or shirts instead of buying fabric by the yard.

, If you search the internet for ""cloth diaper pattern,"" you should find many free options to choose from.However, you can also purchase a cloth diaper pattern. The pattern will look similar to a large spool of thread or hourglass.


Another pattern option is to buy a cloth diaper and trace it onto a pattern made of thick paper, like butcher paper.

, Use a light marker or fabric marker to trace your pattern onto the fabric and then cut it out. Repeat this process so that you have two cloth diaper shapes. One will go on the outside and the other will go on the inside of the diaper.

, Center one of the soaker pad inserts on the middle of one of the cloth diaper pieces so that it is extending from one end of the diaper piece to the other. Then, lay your other piece of fabric over this one and pin the diaper piece into place.

, Pin the layers into place around the edges of the cloth diaper and through the soaker pad insert. Make sure that all of the edges are even.

, Take the cloth diaper to the sewing machine and sew a straight stitch around the outer edges of the pad to secure it in place. Remove the pins as you go.

, Next, sew a straight stitch 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) from the outside of your layers, making sure to back stitch at the ends.


If you do not want the raw edges of your material visible, then you can fold over the edges as you sew, but it is not necessary. A little extra fabric on the outer edge of the seam is okay and may even offer some extra leak protection.

, Mark the places where you want the 3/8 inch (1 cm) sew-on elastic to go. You will need some elastic at the top backside of the diaper and the edges of the legs. The elastic should stop about two inches (5 cm) from both ends of the diaper at the top and legs.

, The elastic will need to be even with the straight stitch that you just made on the legs and backside of the diaper.

, When you have decided where to place your elastic, go over the elastic with a large zig-zag stitch. Back stitch a couple of times also.


It is important to go over the elastic multiple times to ensure that it will stay in place.Make sure that you tug on the elastic as you sew to ensure that it will have the desired cinching effect around the waist.

, Do not add elastic at the bottom of the diaper where you will pull it over the baby's stomach. The elastic should pull the fabric in when you are done.


As you sew on the elastic, make sure to stretch it slightly to ensure that it will pull in the fabric around the legs and back of the diaper.

, To avoid having elastic right up against your baby’s skin, you will need to sew your third diaper cutout over the inside of the diaper. Line up the fabric with the inside of the diaper and then pin it into place. When you are ready, sew through the outer edges of this piece, the elastic, and the other cloth diaper pieces.

Make sure that you stretch the elastic pieces as you go.

, Cut a length of 1 1/2 inch-wide (3.8 cm-wide) Velcro. You will need enough Velcro so that it goes most of the way across the bottom outside edge of the front of your cloth diaper. Then, cut two small squares of the opposite side of the Velcro, also known as the hook side.


It is best to make the hook side of the Velcro your long piece because this piece can be irritating to your baby’s skin.By placing the hook side on the outer front side of the diaper, it will be less likely to come into contact with your baby’s skin.

, Pin the length of Velcro into place along the bottom outside edge of the diaper. This will be the front of the diaper.

, After you have pinned the Velcro where you want it to go, use a zigzag stitch around the outside of the Velcro strip to attach it to the diaper. Remove the pins as you sew.


Make sure to backstitch a couple of times to be certain that the Velcro is in place., Next, pin the two Velcro squares to the inside edges of the top of the diaper using pins. This is the back piece of the cloth diaper, which will wrap around your baby’s waist and connect with the front piece to secure the diaper.

, To secure the square pieces, use a zigzag stitch again. Remove the pins as you go.


Backstitch the squares a couple of times as well to be sure that the Velcro stays in place., The diapers are now finished and you can use them as soon as you need them!

Attach your buttons by hand-sewing, if you are using a button closure.",How to Sew a Baby Dress2," Align them and smooth them out to remove wrinkles. Press it flat with an iron, if it is wrinkled.

, You may want to cut a slight curve in the middle, but remember baby clothes tend to have a very small scoop compared to older children and adult clothes.

, Leave the space open in the middle. You can add button closures to give more space for your baby's head at the end.

, Choose a complimentary or contrasting color, depending upon the look you prefer.

To make your own bias tape cut inch-long (2.5 cm) strips of material from a t-shirt or other soft fabric. Make sure that the cloth stretches lengthwise along the strip before you cut it with fabric scissors. You may want to make the tape fabric slightly wider and longer for the neck hole.






Iron the fabric in half lengthwise. You can cut off any excess length after you have pinned it in place.







, Place the outside of the fabric down on the table.

, Use 1 piece that extends from the bottom of 1 armhole across the neckline to the base of the second armhole. You will sew the 2 sides together later on.

, Allow the dress fabric to bunch very slightly at regular intervals, creating a gathered look at the arm holes.

, Repeat on the opposite arm. Leave a 1/4-inch (0.6-cm) seam allowance.

,

Use a straight edge to mark a line down the back where you will create the closure. Cut down that line.






Fold and iron the fabric toward the inside of your dress at approximately 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) on both sides. Sew a square seam around the folded fabric on each side.






Attach several small elastic loops on 1 side and sew on several buttons at the same level on the other. You may choose to do this after you have completed the rest of your sewing so that your dress will pass easily through the sewing machine.







, Pin the bias tape at the top of the neck, so that it curves around the neck opening. If you have a button closure, make sure there is a gap in the bias tape so that it can open and close.

,, Pin the sides together.

, Take care to attach the pieces of bias tape at the arm holes together.

, You can attach the elastic loops by hand or with a seam on your sewing machine.

Cotton tees are a good choice because they are soft against the baby's skin and they tend to be more breathable. Be aware of your baby's skin, especially if it is very sensitive.
Try to avoid using the hems of the t-shirts if possible. If you buy new tees be sure to wash them first, especially if they are dark or brightly colored as the dye can transfer.;
, The yarn that you use should be strong enough to securely hold the loops together, plus support the weight of the baby. A yarn that will not stretch or pill is important for added security.
/images/thumb/e/e9/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-2.jpg

You have the option of using other materials such as twine here, but do cover it with something to prevent scratching or irritating the baby's skin.
You can use an extra scrap of the discarded t-shirt parts to make a cover by simply snipping off a piece, folding it in half so that the raw edges are not showing and then tying it around the yarn or twine. This also can be done for pure aesthetic purposes as well.

, All that you will need for this project are: three t-shirts, one piece of yarn and a pair of scissors. The t-shirts should be pre-washed if they are new and should be in your regular size or perhaps, one size up.
/images/thumb/4/4b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-3.jpg

Do not think that you need to make the carrier too big, because the material will relax slightly and this will make the carrier too large for safety.

, This will give you three fabric tubes. Save the top portions for other projects if you are so inclined.
/images/thumb/8/8b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-4.jpg

This is the step where the yarn will come in - gather the yarn around both tubes, going up and through the middle so that when they are tied the two form what will look like a figure eight.
Tie the yarn several times so that it is very secure and then cut off the excess.

, With your scissors cut from the top, left hand corner and then diagonally to the bottom right hand corner, but only through the top part of the tube. What you will end up with is a wide piece with two narrow flaps in front.
/images/thumb/d/dc/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-6.jpg

This may sound confusing at first, but it is really quite simple. With the tube laid flat you have a top and a bottom part.
The bottom part will be the part which is laying on the surface you are working from. Only cut the top part diagonally across, cutting from top to bottom.

, Let them fall to your waist. The tied section should form an X and this part will be on your back to help distribute weight and make the carrier more stable and more comfortable.

This is one of the reasons that using different colored t-shirts is suggested - this way, you know that you have the blue loop (for instance) on your left shoulder and the red one on the right shoulder.

, Take the baby and slide him down your chest and then place one leg into each loop. Make sure that both legs are not in the same loop. Once his legs are in the proper place you should spread out the material to give him support and to prevent painful bunching.

, While the carrier is a great way to carry your baby, you'll need to be sure that you have positioned him correctly. Until he is six months old or so, you will want the baby to face inward rather than outward to prevent problems with the hip. Follow these positioning tips:
/images/thumb/6/69/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-10.jpg

The baby should appear to be “seated” with his knees coming just above his bottom and comfortably bent.
You can tell if the baby is in the proper position on your chest if you can bend and kiss his head without strain.
The baby’s knees should be wide apart instead of forced inward. A good carrier keeps the hips and knees spread and supports the thighs., Take the third t-shirt piece and wrap the widest part (the back side of the tube) around the baby’s bottom and lower back area. Wrap the two flaps around your own waist and tie them securely to help support the baby.
/images/thumb/3/3b/Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg/v4-549px-Make-a-No-Sew-Baby-Wrap-Carrier-from-T-Shirts-Step-11.jpg

This will also provide some additional support for your own lower back and should make the carrier much more comfortable to wear.
Again, spread out the material to prevent bunching. Now you are ready to go with your easy, no-sew baby wrap carrier.

Pick out a soft and pliable felt.,
Make your own pattern.,
Cut the pattern pieces out.,
Pin the upper to the sole of your booties along the front edge.,
Sew the back of each bootie together, forming the heel.Take the two flat edges that were the top of the ""v"" of your upper and overlap them slightly, but keep them parallel.,
Attach the rest of the upper and sole.,
Finish up your little booties by adding any decorations or reinforcements you like.,
Put the booties on your baby!",How to Make Fabric Baby Shoes1," There are many types of felt out there, so be sure that you purchase one that is soft enough to come in contact with your baby's skin. Avoid synthetic fibers, instead opting for a high-quality thick natural felt.


You will need very little felt for this project. A piece that is 6 inches by 15 inches should be more than enough to make a pair of standard baby booties.
You may want to purchase a few colors of felt. The shoes you are making each have several pattern pieces, so you could easily make them multi-colored.
If you prefer, you could make the bottoms of the booties out of leather instead of felt. This may be a good idea if your baby is actually walking on them, as leather will hold up much better than felt.;
, Making simple booties only requires two pattern pieces, the upper and the sole. The upper pattern piece will be a rounded ""v"" shape and the sole will simply be the shape of the outline of your babies foot with quarter inch of seam allowance added all the way around the outside.


The upper pattern piece is the most difficult to make yourself but can be done rather easily. The general shape of the piece is a ""v,"" but with the bottom very round, as it will be the toe of your shoe, and the sides as tall as you want the shoe. The two tops of the ""v"" will be very flat, as you will sew them together to make the back of the shoe.
Begin by measuring around the outside of your babies foot. This length, plus an inch for seam allowance, will be the length of the outside of the ""v,"" from the top, down to the bottom, and up to the other side of the top. The opening of the ""v"" does not need to be very wide, only a few inches at its widest. Remember that the width of each side of the ""v"" will determine the height of the sides of your shoe, so that measurement is up to you.

, Once you have cut them out, position them so they both fit on your felt. Then pin each pattern piece onto the felt before cutting each piece out.


Remember that you will need two of each pattern piece to make a pair of booties. However, they each need to be the opposite of the other, so that you have a left and right bootie. To avoid confusion, cut out one set of felt pieces (the upper and the sole) and then flip both pattern pieces over and cut out a second, opposite, set. Keep the sets together at all times, or mark them lightly, so the pieces don't get swapped.
Felt can be a hard fabric to cut cleanly. Make sure you are using good sewing shears to cut out your pattern pieces, so that the edges of the booties look nice and neat.

, You basically want to attach the two pieces together only at the toe of the bootie. Once you have it pinned, sew the two pieces together.


Remember to line up your upper and your sole piece well. The top and the bottom of the toe section of each piece should be the same shape, so they should match up nicely. If their shapes are slightly off, trim one to match the other.
You can either sew your shoes with a sewing machine or by hand. However, because the shoes are so small, you might consider sewing them by hand with a decorative stitch. Consider using a buttonhole stitch around the outside with a contrasting color of thread., Pin them together and then sew along the overlap, so the outside edge is contained inside your stitches. This will round the back of your shoe and open up the middle of the shoe where your babies foot will be inserted.


The easiest way to contain the exposed edge on the back of the shoe is to use a wide zig-zag stitch on your sewing machine or to sew the back by hand. Either way, you should make sure that your stitches are neat and sturdy.

, Pin the pieces together all around the edge, except around the front, where you have already sewed them together. Once pinned, sew around the edge using the same stitch as you used on the front, making sure that your stitches are kept as close to the edge as possible.

, It may be nice to reinforce the upper edge of the sides of the shoes with a simple blanket stitch, or you could add a few stitches to the center point of the ""v,"" in order to reinforce a spot that might split due to pressure.


There are endless ways to decorate these little shoes. Add some embroidery or other types of embellishment, anything that will give your little baby shoes a little decorative interest.

, They should fit your babies feet perfectly, as they were made specifically for him or her.

Put the shoes on your baby!",How to Make Fabric Baby Shoes2," Purchase fabrics that will hold up to the demands of being on their feet. However, avoid synthetic fibers, as they will not let your baby's feet breathe.


It is a good idea to get several types of fabric for this project. The soles can be made from a bonded fleece, soft leather, or other heavy material, while the uppers can be made from any light weight fabric.You can also get a several colors of fabric if you like.

, In addition to fabric, you will need fusible interfacing (about a square foot) and 1/8 inch wide elastic (18 inches long).


You will also need to use scissors and a sewing machine, or a needle and thread, as well as an iron, to finish this project.

, Making cloth baby shoes requires three pattern pieces, the top, the heel, and the sole. Begin by making the pattern piece for the sole. Trace your babies foot but then round out the front half, around the toes, so that the pattern piece is symmetrical from side to side. Then add a 1/4 inch all around the outside, for seam allowance.


For the top piece, copy the front half of your sole piece, making a straight line across what would be you babies arch.
The heel is the hardest piece to make. The heel is basically a rectangle, with one of the long sides slightly curved out and one end of the short sides pulled in a bit because of the curve. Measure around the back of the sole pattern piece, from where the arch starts, around the back, and around to where the arch starts on the other side. This will be the measurement of both long sides, although you will need to give a slight curve to one of them. The width of the piece will be determined by how high you want the side of the shoe, so that's up to you.
It may be easiest to find an existing pattern online, download it, and then print it out. This is especially true if you have had no experience making sewing patterns in the past.

, For each shoe you will need one sole piece, two top pieces, and two heal pieces. The second top and heel pieces will form the lining the lining of the shoes.


Because the pattern pieces are symmetrical, you will not need to flip over the pattern pieces to make the lining fabric pieces.Consider using a contrasting color for the lining of your baby shoes. This will add interest and color to your little shoes.
Once you have fit and pinned all the pattern pieces onto your fabric, cut them out.

, Only sew them along the straight edge of both. Make sure to line them up exactly.


For the heel piece, once sewn, iron the seam open. Then iron the edges of the short edges in toward the wrong side of the fabric. This will make sure that you have finished edges instead of frayed ones. Once the short edges are folded in, fold along the first seam you sewed, but so that the wrong sides are facing each other. Once ironed into place, you will need to sew along both of the short edges, top stitching 1/4 inch from the edge.For the top piece, once sewn, iron the seam open. Then fold over at the same seam, so the wrong sides are now facing. Iron and then top sew 1/4 inch below the seam.Finally, make two small slits on the lining side of the fabric, right below the last seam you sewed. The slits should run perpendicular to the seam, as they will create an opening to run your elastic through. Be sure not to cut through both layers of fabric. Use a seam ripper to accomplish this.
You can either sew your shoes with a sewing machine or by hand. However, it may be easier and quicker to complete this project with a sewing machine.

, Fold the top seam of the heel piece, the straight long edge, over onto the lining side of the piece, so that it creates a casing for the elastic. Stick the elastic into the casing and then sew along the bottom, making sure not to sew into the elastic., With right sides facing, line up the top piece and the sole piece and then pin them together. Sew around the edge, making sure to stay close to the edge.

, You will need to pin the curved long side of the heel piece to the sole piece. Line up the center point of the heel piece edge to the center point of the back of the sole piece. Pin it there and then pin around both sides, making sure that they line up all along the edge, before sewing all around the edge.


Remember to have the wrong side of the heel piece facing the wrong side of the sole piece.

, Run each piece into the hole, cutting off any excess after you have pulled it tight. To secure it, put in a few stitches across both ends of elastic.


The top of your heel pieces should be slightly scrunched once the elastic is tightened.
Be sure that the opening for your baby's foot is big enough but will not allow the shoe to slip off easily. It may be a good idea to slip your baby's foot in the shoe to check the fit before you secure the elastic permanently.

, Push out all the edges from the inside, making sure that all seams are sitting as they should.

, There are endless ways to decorate these little shoes. Add some embroidery or other types of embellishment, anything that will give your little baby shoes a little decorative interest.

, They should fit snugly but not too tight.

Subtract 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) from that measurement. This will be for the waistband of your dress.

, Find some elastic that is about ½ to ¾ inch (1.27 to 1.90 centimeters) wide and cut it according to the measurements that you took for the top of the dress ad for the waist. You will end up with two pieces of elastic.

, Take your top elastic and bring the two ends together, forming a circle. Overlap the ends by placing one on top of the other. Secure the two ends with fabric glue, hot glue, or superglue. You can also sew the ends down using a needle and thread. This will make the dress more durable. Repeat the process for the waistband.

, Tulle sold by the spool is about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) wide, which makes it the perfect size for making a tutu dress. You can find it at most arts and crafts stores. Tulle by the spool comes in many different colors. It is also available with glitter embedded in it. Sometimes, it has glittered patterns, such as dots, wavy lines, and swirls. You can purchase the tulle all in the same color and pattern, or you can purchase different colors and patterns to create a multi-colored dress.


If you are making a short dress, or a dress for a baby or toddler, you will need two or three spools of tulle.If you are making a longer dress, or a dress for an older child, you will need three or four spools of tulle., Take the measuring tape and place one end at the armpit, where the elastic band will sit. Measure down to where you want the dress to end and add 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) to the length. This is because the tulle will poof up when you tie it to the elastic, making it appear shorter., The board must also include the 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) that you added to the length. You can also use a picture frame, a baking sheet, or anything else, so long as it is the right length and not too thick.

, Place one end of the tulle along the bottom edge of your board and begin wrapping it around the board. Do this until you have used up the entire spool.

, Slide your scissors along the bottom edge of your board and cut through the tulle. You are only cutting one side. Do not cut the other side of the tulle. Each strip of tulle will be twice as long as your dress needs to be. This is because you will be folding the strips of tulle in half later.


For a more interesting shape, consider cutting the bottom of each strip at an angle.

, You will need something to hold the elastic while you tie the pieces of tulle to it. You can use anything cylindrical, as long as it is close to the same thickness as your you'd waist. You can also make your own dress form by taking a piece of poster board, rolling the ends together until they are the same size as your child's torso, and then taping the poster board so that it doesn't unroll.

, Make sure that the space between the two bands is the same as the space between your child's armpit and waist.

, Fold a strip of tulle in half. Stick the looped end under the top elastic, and pull the loose ends through the loop. Gently tug downwards on the loose ends to secure it. Repeat with the rest of the tulle. If you are using more than one color, alternate the colors of the tulle. Do not put any tulle on the bottom elastic yet.









The tighter you squish the pieces of tulle together, the fluffier your dress will be.

, Take the first piece of tulle (both strands) and slide it under the waistband. Bring the strands back up and tie a knot. Gently tug the strands back down. Repeat for the rest of the pieces.








, Take a tape measure and measure from the waistband to the bottom of the skirt. Double the number that you get, and cut pieces of ribbon according to that number. Fold the ribbon in half, and slide the looped end under the waistband, right between two pieces of tulle. Bring the ends of the ribbon up and through the loop, just as you did when tying the tulle to the top elastic. Gently tug the ends of the ribbon back down. Add more ribbon every few inches until you have gone around the entire waist band.

, You can make the dress look angled or ragged depending on you you cut the tulle. For an angled dress, cut the tulle on the front shorter, and leave the back untouched. For a ragged dress, cut random pieces of tulle shorter.

, The ribbon should be four times the length of the top elastic. You will be wrapping it around the top elastic to hide the knots. The ribbon should be no more than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Avoid using wired ribbon as the wires can scratch and poke the child. Instead, try to find a soft ribbon that is satin on both sides.

, Weave it between and around each loop of tulle, creating a candy cane effect. Tuck the two ends of elastic behind the loops of tulle and secure them with fabric glue or hot glue. You can also sew the two ends together.








, To make a halter top for the dress, find the center of your dress and loop a length of ribbon around the elastic the same way you looped the tulle. Instead of pulling the ribbon downwards, pull it upwards. The ribbon will tie behind the child's neck in a bow. How long the ribbon is will depend on how big the bow is and how long the tail ends of the bow will be. The ribbon should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide.


Consider using a satin ribbon that is shiny on both sides.
For a more delicate look, consider using a sheer ribbon or a piece of tulle instead.
Avoid using ribbon with wire inside it, as it can poke your child.

, To make some shoulder straps, put the dress on the child first. Take a length of ribbon and loop it around the elastic at the front, just as you did with the tulle. Instead of pulling the ribbon downward, pull it upward instead. Bring both strands of ribbon over the child's shoulder, and tie it to the elastic on the other side. The ribbon should be about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide.


For a standard look, use a ribbon that is satin on both sides. For a more delicate look, use a sheer ribbon instead. For a fancier dress, use an embroidered ribbon.
Consider using pieces of tulle for the shoulder straps instead. This is perfect for a princess dress.
Avoid using wired ribbon. The sharp ends can poke your child.

, Take a piece of ribbon that is at least 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. The length of the ribbon depends on how big you want the bow to be when you tie it. It should be at least twice the circumference of your child's waist.

, Find the middle of the ribbon and glue it to the center of the waistband. The patch of glue should be no more than 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide. Wrap the ribbon around the dress and tie it in a bow in the back. You can leave the ends long, or cut them short.

, You can embellish the top of the dress by attaching flowers or brooches to where the straps join the elastic. Here are some ideas:


If you made a halter top dress, glue a silk flower or brooch onto the ribbon loop, right where it meets the elastic.
If you made a dress with shoulder straps, glue silk flowers or bows onto the front of each strap.

, You can glue little silk roses onto the shoulder strap ribbon. Put a drop of glue onto the back of a silk rose and press it against the ribbon. Glue another flower 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the first one. Keep doing this until you have created a line of silk roses down the center of the ribbon.

, The bodice of the dress is the space between the waistband and the top of the dress. You can attach silk or ribbon flowers to the pieces of tulle using fabric glue or hot glue. You can also attach rhinestones, gemstones, and even craft butterflies!

, You can transform a tutu dress into a fairy dress by gluing silk or ribbon flowers along the waistband. Do not take the dress off the dress form just yet. Place a drop of fabric glue or hot glue onto the back of a silk or ribbon flower, and press it against the waistband. Hold the flower in place for a few seconds before adding another flower. You can also use silk leaves as well.

, If you used a plain ribbon for the waistband, you can draw swirls and squiggles on it using glittery or pearlescent puff paint.

, Purchase some rhinestones and glue them to the waistband of the dress using fabric glue or hot glue. You can also outline each rhinestone with glittery puff paint for extra sparkle.

, Glue some silk or ribbon flowers to several strands of tulle on the skirt of the dress. You can also glue craft butterflies and appliqués.If the dress is for a little witch instead, use some plastic spiders instead for a scary effect.

, To make the tutu dress look ruffled, take a contrasting color of tulle and cut it into 5-inch (12.70-centimeter) wide strips. This will leave you with 5 by 6 inch (12.70 by 15.24 centimeter) rectangles. Take a rectangle it turn it horizontally, so that the short ends are facing left and right, and the long ends are facing the floor an ceiling. Hold it against one of the strips of tulle from the dress. Position it so that it is about 2 ½ inches (6.35 centimeters) from the bottom, and tie a knot., You can make the dress look like it is made from flower petals by knotting the bottom end of each strand of tulle. Try to get the knot as close to the end as possible, and tie it tightly. Use a pair of scissors to snip any extra tulle off, and try to cut as close to the bottom of the knot as possible., You can cut the strips of tulle that make up the skirt of the dress into different lengths, creating a tattered effect. This is perfect for a little pirate or witch!

, If this dress is for a princess, you could make a cone hat to go with it. Simply roll a piece of poster board into a cone shape, and tape it shut. Decorate the cone hat with tulle, rhinestones, and glitter., Take a 12-inch (30.38-centimeter) dowel and wrap a pretty ribbon around it, making it look like a candy cane. Secure the ends of the ribbon to the dowel with some glue. Use hot glue or super glue to attach a rhinestone, bead, or button to the bottom of the wand. Cut several long pieces of ribbon and tie them to the top of the wand. Bend a pipe cleaner into a star or heart shape, and glue it to the top of the wand.


You can also paint a heart or start-shaped piece of wood a pretty color, and glue it to the to of the wand instead of using a pipe cleaner.
You can also use other items to top the wand, such as Christmas ornaments, silk flowers, and plastic figurines.

Wear the sling.",How to Make a Baby Sling," It's very important to choose the right fabric for your sling, no matter which type you make. Be sure to choose a strong fabric that will not tear or lose its shape. It's also preferable to have a breathable fabric. Linen and denim are both excellent choices.Fabrics like flannel, muslin, quilting fabrics, and cotton gauze will not be strong enough.
Avoid fabrics with too much elasticity, such as jersey, as they will not provide the needed support and will stretch out with wear.
Don't use any type of rough fabric because it may harm the baby's skin.;
, If you are making a ring sling, you will need two rings that are 2.5-3 inches (6.4-7.6 cm) in diameter to hold your sling together and make it adjustable. You can purchase metal and plastic rings specifically designed for this purpose online. You may also be able to find sturdy metal rings at the hardware store, but you may have a difficult time finding a size that will work for you.Make sure your rings are at least 3/8 inches (1 cm) thick.
Keep in mind that rings that were not specifically designed for this purpose may not be as safe for your baby to put in his mouth.
Don't use D-rings, as these can slide through each other, causing your sling to slip.
Don't buy rings at a craft store, as these are not designed to be weight-bearing.If your ring has a weld, make sure it is not rough or it might tear the fabric.

, Slings can pose a serious suffocation risk if the baby is not placed correctly. To minimize this risk, make sure your baby is always in the proper position.Make sure the baby's mouth and nose are visible not covered by the sling's fabric.
Make sure the infant is not positioned in such a way that his chin is curled to his chest. In young infants, this position restricts the airway, limiting the baby's supply of oxygen.
Take extra care with very small babies and babies who have breathing problems (even from a cold), as these factors both greatly increase the risk that a baby will suffocate in a sling.

, To make a ring sling, you will need 2-2.5 yards (1.8-2.3 m) of fabric that is at least 36 inches (91.4 cm) wide. You will also need matching thread, a sewing machine, and two rings.


The exact length of the fabric needed will depend on the size of the sling wearer.
The width will depend on the weight of the fabric you are using. If you choose a lighter-weight fabric, you may want more than 36 inches of width.

, To get started, hem both long sides of your fabric and one short side by folding 1/4 inch (6.35mm) of the edge of the fabric onto the wrong side and sewing a line of stitches to secure.


Depending on the type fabric you use, you may be able to get away with not hemming. If the fabric frays, you will definitely want to hem.

, The next step is to pleat or fold the un-hemmed end of the fabric lengthwise. One of the easiest ways to do this is to fold the material back and forth along the long edge like a fan, making the folds slightly bigger than the diameter of the rings.


To ensure that they don't unravel during the next step, secure the folds by taping the fabric together. You can also secure the folds with straight pins or a loose stitch.

, Feed the folded or pleated edge of your fabric through the two rings. Then fold the edge of your fabric back over the ring so that that the wrong sides of the fabric are together and secure with a sturdy seam.


This is a weight-bearing seam, so make sure it is extremely strong. You may want to sew two straight lines approximately 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) apart to reinforce the seam. Zig-zag stitching can also be added to ensure the stability of the sling.
Once your seam is in place, you can remove the tape, pins, or stitches that were temporarily securing your pleats.

, To wear your sling, feed the short edge through both rings, coming up from the wrong side of the fabric, and then thread the end back through the bottom ring only. The sling will be worn around the body and over one shoulder, with the rings at the shoulder, forming a pocket for the baby.


Pull on the tail of fabric that was just fed through the rings to tighten the sling the desired amount to secure the baby in position.
If you find that your tail is too long, hem it.

, You can use the same type of fabric that you would use for the sewn version, or you can recycle a fabric item that you already have, as long as it is a strong enough fabric. Pashmina scarves work nicely, although they may not be long enough for everyone., You will need two rings for this sling, just as you do for the sewn version. To attach them, simply thread your fabric through both of the rings. Then, with the rings about twelve inches from one end of the fabric, thread the fabric back over the first ring and under the second.


If you are using very thin fabric and/or large rings, you can wrap the fabric through the rings this same way a second time for added strength.

, If you find that your fabric is bunched up after being threaded through the rings, gently pull it apart so that it is more evenly distributed around the rings. Your sling will not be as comfortable or as sturdy if your fabric is bunched.

, When you are finished, the longer end of the fabric should be long enough to wrap around your body and fasten in the rings securely. The shorter end of your fabric should be at least 10-12 inches long.

, You will need fabric that is at least 23.5 inches (59.7 cm) wide. (Many fabrics are sold in widths of 45 inches.) To calculate the length, measure from your shoulder to your opposite hip. Then double that number and add six. In addition to fabric, you will also need matching thread and a sewing machine., If you are starting with fabric that is 45 inches (114.3 cm) wide, cut it in half length-wise. Each of the resulting pieces will make one pouch sling.

, Hem both of the long sides of your fabric by folding the edge of the fabric down 1/4-inch (6.35 mm) onto the wrong side and securing with a row of stitches.

, Fold the fabric in half lengthwise, and then again widthwise so that the four corners are lined up. Then cut a small arc from the bottom (folded) area to the top edge, as if making half of a smile. Cutting all four of your corners at once will keep your arcs symmetrical.

, Now sew the four corners that you just rounded together using your sewing machine. This seam will be weight bearing, so it's best to use a strong seam, like a French seam.


For a French seam, start with the wrong sides of the fabric facing each other and sew a seam just above the raw edges. Then turn the fabric inside out and sew another seam just above the raw edges. Try to make this seam as narrow as possible. This should encase your first seam. Lastly, turn the sling right side out again and stitch the seam flat along the inside., To wear your sling, fold it in half lengthwise with the hemmed edges together, putting your head and one arm through the center. It should be draped over one shoulder like a sash with the edges up and the seam in the front. This makes a pocket in which to place the baby.

Cut strips of fabric 1–3 inches (2.5–7.6 cm) wide and remove seams.,
Tie two strips in a simple loose knot.,
If you want stripes in your rug, arrange your strips so that they alternate A,B,A,B when you lay them flat.,
Continue taking each right-hand strand and going under, over, under.,
When you get a braid about half the length of the rug you want, it's time to turn.,
Work your way back down to the starting knot following the exact same pattern as you used to make the original braid, just tucking the end through each time.,
Once you get back down to the original knot, and work your way around the curve, skipping and tucking as necessary to lay flat, it's time to add a strip!,
Braid all of the way down to the end and back up the other side to the original knot.,
Pick up that right-hand gray one, and go under, over, under, over, under, over, under, over, under-->TUCK!

,
Every time you work yourself back to the beginning knot, add another set of strips until you get the size rug you're looking for.

,
Once the rug is the width you want it across the middle, it's time to work yourself back down to 8 strips, then 6, 4, 2, and finally none in a way that doesn't throw off your overall shape.,
Cut a hole in the ends of both strips you want to join.,
Shove the new one through the old one.

,
Then push the tail end of the new strip through its own hole and tug until snug.

",How to Weave a Rag Rug," The length only matters for how often you want to be taking the time to join new strips.

, You'll be trying to shove fabric through this later, so if you make it too tight, you might get aggravated. Also, notice that the pieces in the picture are uneven. At the end of every strand, you'll have to join a new one, and it looks better if that's staggered.

, Then take the one on the right side and go under, over, under.

, Notice that it's not a tight braid. It's just snug enough to lay flat and hold its shape.

, Go under, over, under with that strip on the right (a gray one in this picture) and then turn the entire braid to the right so you can tuck the strip in the edge of the original braid.
Depending on your material, your rug may not want to lie flat if you turn it too quickly, so you may not get to tuck every strand into the original braid. Sometimes you might have to skip tucking a couple so you can turn the corner smoothly.

, (If you want the stripes, tuck it in its own color as you come around and down.)

, To maintain the stripes, join one of each color together and stick it through the starting knot in a way that keeps the pattern. Then continue braiding the same way you have been all along, but now it's under, over, under, over, under-->TUCK!

, Add another strip where ever you can sneak it in to make eight strips.

,,, As shown in the picture, go under, over, under, over, under-->TUCK-->TUCK AGAIN under two more blues horizontally--->snip off the excess. Continue until you run out of strands.

Sew up the hole.",How to Sew a Blanket," Batting is padding which fills your blanket up. You can buy prepackaged batting (insular material) in Twin, Queen, and King sizes at your local fabric or craft store. You can also buy a custom size directly off of the bolt in store. If you go the custom route, you will want to make sure that your batting is rectangularly shaped (Twin sized batting for example is 72X90 inches) so that it covers your entire body lengthwise.The size of the batting you choose to buy will depend on how large you want your blanket to be. Prepackaged batting usually comes in standard widths of 45 and/or 60 inches. However, if you buy the batting custom cut, you can get it in any size you wish.
You can choose either cotton or polyester batting. Cotton is more soft to the touch, while polyester is more stiff. Often times cotton batting comes pre-shrunk as well which is an added bonus.
You will also need to choose whether your batting will be high or low-loft quality. High-loft quality is a thicker batting. Low-loft quality is a thinner batting that helps to lay your blanket out flat.
Try to find batting which is in sheet form rather than loose. Sheets of batting are much easier to handle, cut, and sew.;
, There are many different designs out there on the market, including floral, animal print, and striped. You may also find a solid color you like such as a dark green or hot pink. The choices are nearly endless. Note that the color of the flannel will appear when you either use or fold your blanket, so you may want it to match the surroundings, such as the cushions in your living room.Because flannel comes in so many different colors you can, in general, only buy it prepackaged. If you are making a custom sized blanket, buy a prepackaged flannel which is slightly larger than the size of your blanket. You can then cut it down to the proper size later on.
The labels on the prepackaged flannel will also detail the thickness, which varies depending on brand.

, There should be a section at your local arts and crafts store which sells ""Soft and Comfy"" fabric. Plush fabric is made of 100% polyester fiber, and comes in different styles such as shaggy, stripes, dots, and fluffy. Choose a plush fabric which goes with your flannel design and color. Usually people go with white as their plush fabric which goes with any color, but you can choose whatever color or design you like.If you buy plush fabric off of the bolt, make sure that you get the same dimensions as both the flannel and batting.
If you buy it prepackaged, make sure that it is slightly larger than the flannel and batting so that you can cut it down to the proper size later on.
Since this is the fabric which will touch your skin as you lay underneath, you will need to check whether the material bothers your skin. You should also check the added dyes in the fabric and whether or not you have an allergy to it.

, If you will be using a sewing machine, you will need to buy standard, single strand sewing thread. If you wish to hand-sew the blanket, you should grab some 6-count embroidery floss. Even if you decide to use a sewing machine, you will still need some 6-count embroidery floss to finish the blanket's edges.Try to get a color which matches the flannel and plush fabric. If you wish to see the stitch design, make sure to purchase a high contrast color of thread and embroidery floss.
You will also need to buy a needle with a large eye so that the 6-count embroidery floss can easily slide through.

, Do this before you begin sewing. This will prevent the blanket shrinking into a strange, uneven shape when you wash it. If the flannel and plush fabric are both prepackaged, you can wash them normally with cool water and a safe fabric detergent.It they were cut directly off of the bolt, and therefore cut, put them in separate mesh laundry bags. You can then wash them with cold water and a safe fabric detergent.
You do not have to wash the batting if it is already preshrunk. If it isn't preshrunk, gently hand wash the batting with cool water, a soft washcloth, and a touch of fabric detergent. Run it under cool water when you are done to get the fabric detergent out.
The flannel and plush fabric can be dried in your home dryer on low heat. Batting that has been washed should hang dry.

, This step is only for people starting off with different sized fabrics. You need to have them all the same size before you begin to sew. Place all three fabrics (flannel, batting, and plush fabric) on top of one another. Match all three up at one corner, so that the sides coming off of that corner are flush with one another.Pin the pieces of fabric together so that they do not slide as you cut them.
You can either cut them with a pair of scissors or a rotary blade. If you use a rotary blade, make sure you do the cutting on a safe surface.
Cut the fabric in sections. You can use a ruler as you go down to make sure that the dimensions of your fabric stay the same all the way down. Use a small, light pencil mark when you are marking where you want to cut.

, After you have your fabric cut, and they are all equal sizes, lay down your batting on a smooth table top. On top of the batting, place the flannel right side up. On top of the flannel, place the plush fabric right side down. This means that the flannel and plush fabric right sides will be facing one another.Once you have them in the correct order on top of one another, straighten them out. Place pins through the inner part of all three layers so that they stay straight when you begin to sew.

, This means you will be placing tape around the backside of your plush fabric. For example, if you want a 1/2 inch inseam, place masking tape all the way around your rectangle 1/2 inch from the edge of the fabric. The edge of your tape will be 1/2 inch away from the edge.Use a ruler or a straight edge in order to keep the masking tape straight. Leave the tape on until you are done sewing.
You can also replace tape with a simple light pencil line, although this may be hard to see as you are sewing.

, Place the fabric underneath the needle of your sewing machine. Go slowly, and pull consistently, as you move your fabric down. Make sure the seam of your thread is sewing on the outside edge of the masking tape (1/2 inch away from the edge of the fabric for a 1/2 inch inseam).You can create curved stitch marks at the corners, or stop your sewing machine, and reposition your material 90 degrees so that you create a sharp sewn corner.
When you get close to finishing, leave a hole about 6-8 inches long, from where you stopped to where you began sewing.

, If you do not have a sewing machine, or prefer a more handcrafted look, choose this step instead of the previous one. First, you will need to thread your needle with 6-count embroidery floss. On the long, hanging end of your thread, tie a knot. Start at the corner of your blanket, and move down the sides. Stick your needle in the underside of the corner of just the plush fabric. Pull the needle all the way through until the knot catches. Pull your needle all the way around the edge of the three fabrics. For more information on the blanket stitch, see: How to Sew Blanket StitchStick your needle underneath the batting, and through the top, already threaded hole in the plush fabric. Pull the thread through, while holding a finger near the edge of your fabric so that the thread does not pull through all the way.
Stick your needle through the loop created by your finger. Pull the needle all the way through until the stitch is tight.
Stick your needle underneath the batting, about 1/2 inch away from the previous stitch, moving downwards. Slide the needle through all three fabrics, while keeping your finger near the edge to create a loop. Stick your needle through the loop and pull tight.
Repeat the previous step over and over again, until you have made your way around the blanket. If you need to add another piece of floss, simply tie a knot and begin again at the spot where you left off. Remember to leave a 6-8 inch hole between where you finally end, and where you began sewing.

, You do not want a bulky edge for your blanket. Use a pair of scissors or a rotary blade to cut around the edge of your blanket, about 1/4 inch away from the inseam. If you use a rotary blade, make sure you are using a safe surface to cut on.After you have trimmed the excess, you can peel off the masking tape, and pull out the pins that were stuck in your blanket to hold it down.

, Pull up the edge of the top layer of plush fabric. Take your iron, turn it on low, and gently press the edge of fabric down. Make sure that when you pick the iron up, the edge of fabric stays flat. Do this all the way around the edge of the blanket.Once you are done with the top edge, flip your blanket upside down. Turn your iron on low again, and press the edge of the flannel down. Do this all the way around the edge of the blanket.

, Up until now, the batting has remained on the outside, and the plush fabric has been right side in. Stick your hand in the hole between the flannel and plush fabric (not between the flannel and batting). Push your hand all the way in until you can feel the seam on the other side and gently pull.It is important to do this slow so that you do not accidentally rip out any of the stitching.
Once you get the bulk of it flipped inside-out, tuck your hand back into the hole and poke your finger into the corners. You can also pull from the outside to make them straight and not bunched inward.

, Turn your blanket over so that the plush fabric is on top. Just like before, the goal is to sew a blanket stitch. Slide the 6-count embroidery floss through the eye of your needle. Tie a knot at the long, loose end. slide it underneath the plush fabric, and out the top, until the knot catches. Note: you are only sliding the thread through the plush fabric, not the flannel or batting. For more information on the blanket stitch, see: How to Sew Blanket StitchTake your needle all the way around the edge, and slide it into the flannel underneath. Stick your needle all the way through the three fabrics, and up through the hole you already sewed through. As you are pulling the thread through, place your finger on the edge of the fabric so that the thread does not go all the way through.
Take your needle and slide it through the loop you created with your finger. Pull the thread tight. Slide your needle underneath the flannel about a 1/2 inch down from the previous stitch. Slide your needle through all three fabrics as you hold your finger on the edge of the blanket to catch the thread.
Put your needle through the loop you created with your finger, and pull your thread tight. Repeat the previous steps over and over again until you have stitched the hole together. Tie a knot in the thread when you are done.

A traditional bedspread is large enough to cover the entire bed, generally extending to the floor, and has a medium thickness.
Comforters are the thickest bedspreads and cover only the mattress, allowing you to integrate a bed skirt into the bed dressing.
Coverlets are thin bedspreads that cover only the mattress and are often used as a layer between the sheets and a thicker bedspread, or as the primary bed covering during the warmer months.;
, Using a tape measure, deduce the length and width of your intended bedspread. Keep in mind how far to the floor you want your bedspread or comforter to reach, and add space for seam allowances.

, This will determine the type of batting (padding) that you will use. Keep in mind that if you want to make a comforter, you will need twice the batting while, to make a coverlet, you will need no batting at all.

, You will need a face fabric, which will be displayed, and a backer fabric.

,, This may require piecing 2 or more lengths of fabric together

, Place the face and backer pieces together, outside in, and stitch around 3 sides, leaving 1 width-wise end open.

, For large bedspreads or thick comforters, you will likely have to piece several pieces of batting together to create the size and thickness you desire, and then trim it to the appropriate size. If you are making a coverlet, skip the steps pertaining to batting.

, By hand, loosely stitch the corners of the batting square you created onto the corners of the backer fabric. Be careful not to sew the batting to both the face and the backer fabric, or you will not be able to turn the bedspread out.

, You will need to adjust the batting, face and backing in order to line them up for finishing.

,,, Keep your stitching as close to the edge as possible.

, Do this by stitching around the entire outside perimeter of your bedspread, being sure to include the batting. You may want to stitch inside the bedspread to hold the batting in place using a purchasable, pre-designed pattern.

However, if you want a bigger quilt and you don't have enough t-shirts, you can make blocks out of the plain fabric on the back of your t-shirt or buy patterned cotton fabric.


Approximately 12 t-shirts (3 by 4 blocks) will make a throw sized blanket. 20 shirts (4 by 5 blocks) will make a twin bed sized quilt. 30 shirts (5 by 6 blocks) will make a double sized quilt. 36 shirts (6 by 6 blocks) will make a queen sized quilt and 42 shirts (6 by 7 blocks) will make a king sized quilt.;
, Treat any stains before you throw them in the wash. It will be hard to remove deep stains later on in the process.

, The amount you need will depend upon the size of t-shirt quilt you would like. You want to have 2.5 inch (6.4 cm) borders and 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces for sashing.


Choose something that either matches your décor or matches your t-shirts. You may also want to use the same fabric for the back of your blanket.

, Use cold water and low heat in the washer and dryer to ensure dark colors do not fade.

, Decide if your block designs will fit in a 12 by 12 inch block or if they need to be 14 by 14 inch blocks. All the blocks need to be the same size.

, You will adhere this to the back of your t-shirt squares to keep your blanket squares from stretching. Buy enough to have approximately 17 inch (43.2 cm) squares of interfacing for all of your blanket blocks.

, Center the logo and cut 15 inch (38.1 cm) squares with a rotary cutter, if your final blocks will be 12 inches (30.5 cm). Cut 17 inch (43.2 cm) squares if your final blocks will measure 14 inches (35.6 cm).

,, Lay the t-shirt square with the logo down. Lay the fusible interfacing with the resin side down, on the back of your t-shirt square.

, Follow the package instructions to ensure you attach the fusing correctly.

, Use a rotary cutter or fabric scissors. This will give enough room for seam allowance.

, Determine how you want your quilt to be arranged. Try to put intricate designs next to simple ones and light colors next to dark ones.

, They should be either 15 inches (38.1 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm) or 13 inches (33.0 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm), depending upon the size of your blocks. Pin the sashing to the bottom of the blocks, with a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.


The bottom blocks of the blanket do not need horizontal strips, because they will be next to the border.

, Use a 1/4 seam allowance for the entire project. Sew 4, 5, 6 or 7 columns together, depending upon the size of your quilt.

, You do not need to measure and cut vertical sashing strips for the outside edges, because you will have borders. Sew 1 sashing strip to the right of each column.

, Cut off any excess fabric around your blanket top. Once your columns are sewn, it is time to begin your borders.

, The strips should be 25 inches (12.7 cm) wide. Pin the borders to your blanket top.

, Measure a layer of batting that is the length and width of your blanket. Set the layer of batting on top of your quilt top.

, It should be the length and width of your completed quilt top. Cut it with a rotary cutter or fabric scissors.

, Stitch around the outside of your quilt with a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. Leave 1 side of the quilt open so that you can turn the quilt right side out.

, Pin the remaining open side closed by turning the edges under. Hand sew the remaining side with a needle and thread.

, Alternately, you can hand stitch down the sashing on your quilt. This will keep your batting and quilt blocks from moving around and bunching on the inside of your blanket.

Start off with two one-yard strips of fleece material.,
Lay your first piece of fleece with the rougher side facing up and then lay the second yard of fleece on top, soft side facing up.,
Slide your self healing mat under the fleece and cut off the rough selvage edges of the fleece using scissors or a rotary cutter.,
Pin your four-inch by four-inch square template to any corner of your fleece and cut around it so that there is an outward facing right angle chunk cut out.,
Take your tape measure and lay it across the fleece from the top of one right angle to the other so that there is a four-inch strip of fleece below the tape measure.,
Keep the tape measure in place and use your scissors or rotary cutter to cut strips of fleece one-inch thick all along the four-inch section.,
Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece, making sure to pin the tape measure in place.,
Separate the top layer of fleece from the bottom layer of fleece for each fringe and tie the two together in a double knot.,
Double-check to make sure that each tie is tightly knotted and you're finished!

",How to Make Baby Blankets1," You can choose any color or pattern you desire.


Fleece tie blankets are extremely easy to make because they don't require any sewing and fleece is a relatively cheap material. You can buy yards of patterned or solid colored fleece at any craft store.
For example, you might want to choose your child's favorite color or a theme pattern with animals, a sports team, or flowers.
You can also mix and match patterns and solids by using a single color on one side of the blanket and a patterned print on the other. In this case you will need one yard of each style you plan to use.;
, In other words, the rougher sides of the fabric will be touching each other.

, Make sure to use the lines on your template for a straight cut. You do not need to cut the other edges unless they are uneven or you are using a rotary cutter with a patterned cut.

, Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece.

, It's helpful to pin the tape measure down so that it doesn't move.

, Only cut to just below the tape measure line.

, You should now have fringes along all sides of the fleece that are one-inch thick and four-inches long.

, Continue to tie each fringe together until you have made your way around the entire blanket.

, The side that you already cut may not match up with the lines that you drew on the right. This is fine. Ignore the lines that you drew, and use the left side as a guide for cutting the right. This ensures that your tail is symmetrical., The fabric can be any color you want. It can be the same color as your tail, or a different one.

, The bottom, pointed end of the tail should overlap the top edge of the fin fabric by about 9 inches (22.86centimeters).If this is for a child, the overlap could be smaller--about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters).

, Start drawing the fins at the top edge of the fin fabric. Extend the pins past the 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) overlap. They can be any shape or size you want. Most mermaid fins are shaped like two leaves joined at the tip.You will be cutting your fins the same way you drew your tail, so you can draw half a fin if you'd prefer.
Draw the fins a little bigger than you want them to be. You will need 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for the seam allowance.

, Next, use the lapping point from your tail to cut a V shape into your fins. When you are done, you should have a set of fins with a V shape cut into the top edge that is the same shape as size as the bottom 9 inches (cc centimeters) of your tail., This is not absolutely necessary, but it could give your tail a nice touch. Simply use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew a series of vertical lines going from the top of your fin piece to the bottom. Do this for the fin pieces separately. Do not topstitch them together.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.
For a more realistic touch, angle the lines slightly so that they are closer together at the top and wider at the bottom.
Make the lines about 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart.

, Pin the front fin piece to the front tail piece. Start pinning up one side of the point/notch, then down the other. Repeat this step for the back pieces.


Make sure that you are pinning the fabric with the right sides together.
It may help to cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slit into the bottom of the V on the fin.

, For now, sew just the front fin piece to the front tail piece, and the back fin piece to the back tail piece. Use a 1 inch (2.54 centimeter) seam allowance and a stretchy stitch, such as a zigzag.Be sure to remove the pins as you sew.

, Once you have sewn the fins to the tails, it's now time to pin everything together. Sew your first tail down, right side up. Place your second tail down on top, right side down. Pin around the edges.

, Use a 1-inch seam (2.54 centimeters) allowance and a stretchy stitch. Leave the top edge open and remember to backstitch at the stat and end of your sewing.


Fleece does not fray, so you do not need to serge or finish the inside seams.
Consider clipping the corners on the fin. This will help reduce bulk when you turn it inside out.

, Fold the top edge inward by 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Topstitch it down as close to the inside edge as you can using a stretch or zigzag stitch.


If you have any of your fin fabric left over, you can cut a 4-inch (10.16-centimeter) wide bad out of it, and use it to make a band instead., Your blanket is now ready to use!

Lay out the ribbon and start to attach the triangles, using the hemmed edge at the top.,
Leave a gap of 3 centimeter (1.2 in) to 5 centimeter (2.0 in) between the flags.








,
Continue adding the flags until you reach your desired length.,
Hang them up!








",How to Make Bunting," Draw a triangle measuring 20 centimeter (7.9 in) wide by 20 centimeter (7.9 in) deep, then cut it out.








, If using a tea-towel, use the hemmed edge as the top edge of the triangle (this will save you having to create your own hem).








,,, Use either glue, tape, or thread depending on your material.









Use a standard straight stitch to sew the flags to the ribbon.
If you did not use the ready-made edge from the tea-towel fabric, fold the material under at the top edge, and sew onto the ribbon.

,, Keep going until you have finished sewing all the pieces onto the ribbon. Make sure you leave a longer gap at either end, so that you have enough ribbon to tie up your bunting. Using a sewing machine is quicker, but you could do this by hand.









Give the pieces a quick iron if you're using cloth.

Decide on the size of needle you want.,
Begin by casting on the correct number of stitches.,
Grab the threaded strand and pull both strands tight until you have created an adjustable slipknot that allows you to alter the size of your loop.,
Use the backward method to cast-on by twisting the yarn into a loop around your index finger and wrapping the loop over the top of the needle.,
Once you've cast on your foundation row, use a garter stitch to knit your blanket to your desired size.

,
Bind off your stitches by inserting the left needle into stitch you knitted first, and pulling it over the second stitch and completely off the needle.

,
Knit one more stitch, thread the left needle into first stitch on right needle.

,
Finally, pull it over the new stitch and completely off the needle.

,
Continue to bind off the remaining stitches and then cut the remaining yarn leaving a six-inch end.",How to Make Baby Blankets2," You can use small or large needles for this project, just be sure to use one strand of yarn throughout if using a small needle and up to three strands for larger needles.

, You can cast on by making a loop with your yarn and threading the top strand under and through the loop.

, Place the slipknot on your needle and pull tight.

, You will have a single twist that allows you to pull the yarn tight around the needle.


If you are using size 7, 8, 9 or 10 needles, cast-on about 150 stitches for a medium-sized blanket. If using a size 11, 12 or 13 needle, cast on between 70 to 80 stitches. For even larger needles, cast on between 60 and 70 stitches.

,,,,, Use your needle to draw the loose end through the last stitch.

"

Start with 18 ounces of medium worsted-weight yarn and a size H crochet hook.,
Make a foundation chain of 132 stitches.,
Stitch one double crochet stitch in the fourth chain stitch from the hook.,
Repeat the double crochet stitch for the entire 132 foundation chain so that you create one double crochet stitch for each chain stitch.

,
At the end of the row, flip your blanket so that the last stitch made is now the first stitch to be worked for the next row and make three chain stitches.

,
Make one double crochet stitch in each double crochet stitch across the row and then flip the work again and stitch three chain stitches.,
Continue this movement until you have just under a foot of yarn left.

,
Cut the leftover yarn down to about six inches and thread it through your needle, pulling it through the last loop on your crochet hook.,
For more advanced crocheters, add variation by using multiple colors of yarn.",How to Make Baby Blankets3," You may want to purchase yarn specifically for babies' skin, though any kind will work.

, To do so, slide a slipknot onto the crochet hook, wrap the yarn around the hook from the back to the front and draw a new loop through the knot.

, To do so, wrap the yarn around the hook, put the hook through the fourth stitch from the hook, wrap the yarn around the hook again, and bring a new loop through the stitch. Next, wrap the yarn around the hook again, bringing it through two of the loops on the hook. To complete the double crochet stitch, wrap the yarn around again and draw it through the last two loops on the hook.

,,, This step will be your crocheting pattern for the rest of the blanket.

,, Incorporate any loose ends into the blanket with small stitches before trimming the ends.

, To incorporate multiple colors, finish the last double crochet of a row and wrap the new color of yarn around the hook. Pull it through the remaining two stitches on the hook and continue crocheting with your new color.


Your baby blanket will be about 32 inches (81.3 cm) wide and 35 inches (88.9 cm) long, depending on the tightness of your crocheting.

Cut out 3 and 3/4-inch strips of fabric to use as binding for the edges of the quilt.,
Sew the 3 and 3/4-inch strips together on the short side to make a long piece of fabric about 5 yards (4.6 m) long and fold it in half lengthwise.

,
Pin the rough edges of the strip to the raw edges of quilt on the flannel side.,
Finally, sew the binding to edge of quilt.,
Turn the quilt over and sew the folded edge of the binding to the front of the quilt.",How to Make Baby Blankets4," Cotton is usually used in this style quilt.

, The batting and flannel should be a few inches bigger than the quilt top.


Use safety pins to hold the three materials together.

,,, Follow the tape with the foot of the sewing machine to create a second diagonal stitch.

,, This will create several small X shapes where these diagonal stitches meet the stitches you just created in the opposite diagonal direction.

,, You may want to use a solid color here to tie the patterns you used together.

,, Make sure to cover all four sides of the quilt.

If you'd like to make a reversible fleece blanket, which can be used with either side up, you need enough fleece for two complete blanket-sized layers.









The following size blankets will cover the top of a bed. Add a 1/2 (1.27 centimeters) - to - 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) seam allowance on all sides if you intend to stitch the edges, and don't count the selvage (machine-finished edge of the fabric) as part of the pattern:

Lay the scarf around your volunteer's neck.,
Cut straight below the lowest mark.,
Sew the keyring to the scarf.,
Make a little slip tube out of leather or vinyl to cover the stitches.,
Slip one stitched tube onto each end of the scarf to cover the stitches.,
Stitch the tubes in place.,
Attach your camera.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Camera Strap Out of a Silk Scarf," Mark where you want the silk scarf strap to fall to. Then make another mark about an inch and a half (3.5cm) below this mark to allow for extra sewing room.;
, Using scissors, make a clean cut.

, Fold the scarf end over the keyring circle and sew the free end firmly in place to form a loop that holds the ring. You'll have to attach your camera here, so leave about an inch (2.5cm) of wiggle-room. Do this on both ends of the scarf.

, (See ""Tips"" for other tube material suggestions.)
Measure the width of the scarf loop end you've just sewn to obtain the right width for the tube. Cut the leather/vinyl to the right width and length, leaving adequate seam allowance on each side and each end, to allow for folding over and stitching.






To prevent fraying, you'll need to stitch the edges of the tube material before sewing the tube together. This can be done by machine, or by hand; use a needle able to stitch leather. Fold each edge over slightly and sew along the entire length of each edge to strengthen.






Sew the tube together firmly. Roll the length of leather/vinyl into a cylinder and stitch the joining pieces together, tucking any additional seam allowance inside the tube to ensure neatness. See image for the completed tube.

, Make sure the inside of the tube with the stitching isn't facing outward when you position it, to avoid it showing when you wear the camera. Turn the stitching around, to face it against your body when worn.

, Grab a needle and hand sew the leather tube onto the camera strap. Sew firmly so that it doesn't come loose and slip down onto the key-chain––more stitches are better than not enough. Note that the tube does not cover the end of the scarf or keyring––these should still hang below the tube (see the image).

, Now you have a new strap (or a clever replacement). Enjoy the luxurious feel of silk and use its strength to keep your camera safely in place.

",How to Make a Fitted Sheet,"









If you are using a flat sheet, you only need to measure the depth of the mattress.;
, It should measure the width of the mattress, plus 2 x the depth, plus an additional 16 inches (20.32 cm) for seam allowances and tuck-in (8 inches on each side), and the length of the mattress, plus 2 x the depth, plus 16 inches (20.32 cm). Width + (2 x depth) + 16"" and Length + (2 x depth)+ 16""








, Along one outer edge, measure over the depth of the mattress plus 8 inches (20.32 cm) from the corner of the fabric. Mark this spot.









Measure up the depth of the mattress plus 8 inches from the marked spot. Put a dot at the spot.
Draw a line connecting that dot to the mark on the edge of the sheet. Draw another line connecting the dot to the edge of the fabric on the other side. This gives you a square on the corner of the fabric.

, Repeat on the other 3 corners of the fabric or sheet.








,









The right sides of the homemade fitted sheet should face in.

,,, You can skip this step if you are using a flat sheet.








,,









Leave 1-inch (2.54 cm) wide gaps about 8 inches (20.32 cm) away from the sewn-together corners on each side of the sheet. This allows you to thread the elastic through to make the sheet fitted.

If you can't identify the right side of the fabric, ask the staff before you leave the fabric store. You can also wash the fleece several times, then select the most attractive (least pilled) side of the fabric as your ""right"" side.

, Use a uniform 1/2"" to 1"" (1.25 - 2.5 cm) seam allowance. You have two options for how to finish the fourth edge:









Turn the blanket inside out through the open edge. Hand- or machine-stitch all the way along the final edge, securing the two pieces together.
Stitch along the fourth edge, leaving a 4-inch (10.16 centimeter) opening. Turn the blanket inside out through this opening, so both right sides face out. Hand-finish the 4-inch opening with a blanket or whip stitch.

Or skip the sewing entirely. Cut 1/2"" to 3/4"" (1.25 - 1.9 cm) wide fringe on all sides of the blanket. Tie the two pieces of fleece together, one paired set of fringe ties at a time. See below for directions.



"
"
Cut out a square in each corner.,
Mark and cut the fringe.,
Decide whether you are braiding or knotting your edges.,
Choose a piece of fringe to start with.,
Continue pulling through and ""braiding."",
Cut the very last piece of fringe in half.",How to Make a Fleece Blanket4," That is, after you have the pieces of fabric you want to work with. Cut them to size and then cut out the corners -- around 2"" (5 cm) is a good size.









Corners are virtually impossible to knot or braid. This makes everything much easier and keeps you from wondering what the heck to do with those pesky edges.

, An easy way to do this is with painter's masking tape. Mark a line down all four sides of your blanket (on the top side). Keep it in line with the depth of your corner cuts.









Make your cuts. You'll want around 1 1/2"" (1.9 cm) to 2"" (2.5 cm) for your fringe depth. The width of each piece should be around 1"" (2.5 cm). Grab your rotary cutter are start making slits down all four lengths of the blanket.

, If you're knotting, congratulations! All you have to do is double knot the top and bottom layers of fringe together. Start at one edge and grab two pieces of fringe that are laying on top of each other. Double knot and work your way around. If you're braiding, continue reading:









Make slits in each piece of fringe. That's right: there will be little teeny holes in all your fringes -- that's how they'll stay braided together.

, Any will do. Use a bent paperclip (a crochet hook will work great too) and stick it through the slit of your first fringe.









Then stick the paperclip through the slit of the fringe underneath. It will ""hook"" the second fringe and you can pull it through the first fringe.

, Once you've pulled it all the way through on your first move, your paperclip (or crochet hook) should already be through the slit of the second fringe, and you can move on to the next fringe on the top. Put the paperclip through the next slit to hook the next fringe. If you're right handed, it'll be easiest to work right to left and vice versa.









The most important thing is to always alternate between using a fringe on the top and a fringe from the bottom. When you get to the corners, just keep doing the same thing. It will naturally curve around the corner.

, Use them to tie a knot around the first fringe. Make sure to do at least a double knot and triple if the fringe is long enough. That will be the only knot on your entire blanket.









You're done! And no, the edge will not unravel. As long as you've knotted the last piece, you're good to go.

Choose your fabric.,
Clean the selvage edges up.,
Sew across the narrow edges of your blanket.,
Cut 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) slits into the selvage edges.,
Pull the threads out of the fabric until you reach your stitching.",How to Make a Flannel Throw Blanket1," You will need 1¾ yards (1.6 meters) of fleece fabric, about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. Plaid patterns work best with this, but a solid color will also look nice.Make sure that you are using flannel and not fleece. Fleece does not fray the same way flannel does.
For a larger blanket, opt for a 2-yard (1.8-meter) piece of fabric instead.;
, This blanket will only have a fringe on the narrow edges. The long edges will be left alone for a finished look. Take a look at the long edges of your fabric, and trim off any stray threads. You won't be hemming them because the salvage already takes care of that.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, cut the selvage edges off., Choose a thread color that matches your fabric, and sew across the narrow sides, 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) from the edge. Use a short stitch length. This will keep the fabric from fraying past the fringe.If you want to have a fringe on all four sides, sew around the blanket using a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) seam allowance. Turn the fabric at the corners so that you sew in one continuous line.If you want a longer fringe, leave a larger seam allowance.

, Cut the slits from the narrow edges of the fabric so that they are aligned with the selvage edge. This will make the proceeding steps easier.Be careful not to cut through your stitching!


If you want your blanket to have a fringe on all four sides, cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) square into each of the corners. Be careful not to cut through your stitching. This will make it easier to pull the threads out.
If you want to make a longer fringe, cut longer slits/bigger squares.

, Be careful not the pull the actual stitching threads out, however. You are only pulling the threads that make up the fabric out. The easiest way to do this would be to grab a thread or two with a seam ripper and then pulling it out. Keep doing this until you reach the stitching you made.


Be sure to pull the threads out from the notch you cut into the selvage edge. Do not fray the rest of the selvage.
Run your fingers through the fringe when you are done. This will loosen up the fringe and get rid of any residual fuzz.

Familiarize yourself with the qualities of cashmere.,
Buy it from a reputable store.,
Evaluate it in-person.,
Hold the blanket up to the light.,
Check for pilling.,
Compare the texture with other wool.,
Check its elasticity.,
Burn it.",How to Buy a Cashmere Blanket1," Cashmere is a wool, but it's not just any wool. Cashmere is obtained from a goat of the same name, but only the soft, ultra-fine undercoat is used for textile manufacturing purposes. Because of the extreme environments these goats live in, their undercoat is especially valued for being a great insulator, its durability, and longevity. Cashmere is incredibly soft and lightweight.Good, expensive cashmere hairs will be between 3 to 4 centimeters long each.Cashmere fibers are so thin and lightweight that they weigh 10 times less than other kinds of wool.;
, Large department stores and famous retailers have laboratories where they test all of the wool items they receive for authenticity and quality.Because of this, you can know that even before you perform your own test, someone in quality control has also already tested the fabric to be sure of its authenticity. Multiple checks, however, are a good thing, on the off-chance an inspector missed something.


While it might seem tempting to buy locally while traveling in a foreign country where cashmere goods are produced to help support local people, there are also large profits to be made off of tricking an unknowledgeable consumer into buying inferior goods.If you're particularly dead-set in purchasing a particular blanket you've found at a small store or from a local merchant, you can check the quality of the cashmere by administering a few physical tests and evaluating the fabric.

, Although it's possible that you might find a good deal online, you will want to, if at all possible, go into a store and actually interact with the product in-person. Several of the best tests to determine the quality of the fibers used can only be done by-hand. If you found a bargain online and are dead-set on making that purchase, try to find a local retailer carrying the exact same item; many department stores and home goods stores will carry similar if not identical stock in their stores.

, When you look at the fabric under the light, does it appear shiny like satin? Good cashmere should not. You also don't want to see excessive amounts of light coming through the holes in the weave: a good blanket will be tightly knit, and the light-weighted quality will be an inherent property of the material itself., Pilling is a process that happens overtime due to abrasion. The fibers unravel, resulting in the balled up ends ""pilling"" on the surface of the fabric. Although fabrics made of short, man-made fibers like acrylic, nylon, and polyester are the worst culprits, wool can also pill. Pilling will not only ruin the soft, natural texture of your blanket and its thickness, but, especially on knitted materials, it can also look unsightly.


Longer fibers will pill less and are thus considered higher quality.
Give the surface of the blanket a gentle rub with your hand; watch to see if any fibers start to roll up or shed off of the blanket. Avoid a product that indicates it will shed or pill a lot in the future.

, Mohair, alpaca, angora, and camel are all other fine, luxury wools, but cashmere is still known to be the softest.If you can, find another of these wool products in the store, or perhaps bring something from home made from made of a soft wool, and compare the textures with your fingers. If the cashmere blanket is not softer, then that should bring into question the quality of the fibers.

, A properly made blanket should not fall apart instantly: rather, it should feature a tight enough weave that it will spring back and retain its shape.See what happens when you tug on the blanket: does it start to lose its shape? If it's properly constructed, it should return more or less to its original appearance.

, This is not a test that you can administer easily in your average store: trying to do so before you have purchased the item may get you into legal trouble, and doing it after you buy the item could invalidate your ability to return it. However, in situations where you might be trying to purchase an item as a tourist in a small village, you could ask to administer a burn test to a single fiber taken from the blanket you want to purchase by using a cigarette lighter.


Watch to see how fast it lights on fire: oil-based products (typically used in man-made synthetic fibers) are particularly susceptible to fire.
If the strand produces a strong, plasticity odor while or after having been burnt, this is a strong indicator that at least a percentage of the fibers are synthetic.
After blowing out the fire on the end of the strand, look at the end to see if it has distorted into a ball shape, with a hard plastic feel. There will be no ash, and you will be unable to make the fiber crumble between your fingers. This is another indicator of synthetic fibers.
If the fiber has a natural burnt smell after burning it, check it against the smell of a bit of burnt cotton fiber to be sure that they are not identical: wool and cotton produce distinct smells when burnt."

Measure out two strips of fleece material as big as you want your blanket to be.,
Lay your first piece of fleece with the rougher side facing up and then lay the second yard of fleece on top, soft side facing up.,
Place a self healing mat under the fleece and use a rotary cutter to cut off the rough edges of the fleece.,
Cut a 4-inch by 4-inch square out of thick paper.,
Take your tape measure and lay it across the fleece from the top of one right angle to the other so that there is a 4-inch strip of fleece below the tape measure.,
Cut the 4-inch section into strips any thickness you want using your scissors or rotary cutter.,
Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece, making sure to pin the tape measure in place.,
Separate the top layer of fleece from the bottom layer of fleece for each fringe and tie the two together in a double knot.",How to Make a Blanket1," You will probably want between 1.5 and 3 yards of each fleece. You can choose any color or pattern you desire.


You can mix and match patterns and solids by using a single color on one side of the blanket and a patterned print on the other. In this case you will need one piece of each style you plan to use.;
, Make sure that the rough sides of the fleece are facing one another and that the fuzzy sides are facing outward.

, Use the lines on your template to ensure a straight cut.

, Place it in one corner of the blanket and cut the fleece around it so that a square is cut out of the corner. Repeat for the remaining three sides of the fleece.

, Pin the tape measure down so that it doesn't move.

, Usually 1-inch strips are used. Only cut to just below the tape measure line.

, You should now have fringes along all sides of the fleece.

, Complete for each fringe on the blanket.

Select your fleece blankets.,
Purchase anywhere from 1.5 to 3 yards (1.3-2.7 meters) of each fleece.,
Spread out the material.,
Consider how you will measure the cuts to make the ties.,
Cut out a rectangle from both corners with a pair of scissors (see tips).,
Start cutting strips.,
Tie the corner strips together.,
Tighten the knot.,
Tie the strips at the end between the two corners next in the same way.,
Flatten the fleece out.,
Tie the strips down each side for the length of the blanket.,
Fold the tied portion up.,
Turn the blanket around.,
Trim end and sides as needed.,
Finished.








",How to Make a Fleece Tie Blanket," Use two different fleece patterns or two solid fleece blankets that complement each other. Alternately, use a pattern on one side and a solid color on the other.









Try different combinations. Some patterns that don't seem they would go together actually complement each other quite well. You never know what will look good until you try it out in person.;
, 1.5 yards makes a decent size throw, 2.5-3 yards (2.3-2.7 meters) makes a nice twin size blanket.








, Spread it out so that the softer or more brightly colored sides face out, matching both up at one end and the sides as far as they lay flat. Trim if needed.









Consider the area you have available to spread out your material. If you don't have room to spread out the whole material or you can't physically crawl around on the floor, you can adapt by using a kitchen table or available floor room to cut and tie your fleece.

, They don't have to be exact. When cutting against the nap (usually the narrower end) the strips need to be a little longer (about 4-5 inches/11-14 cm) than along the long sides, (about 2.5-3 inches/7-9 cm) because they don't stretch as much while tying.








, Make sure you are cutting through both pieces of fleece.









Use something rectangular in shape to measure. If you have trouble seeing the graduations on a ruler, a card cut to the right measurements (for instance 3""x5""/9x14 cm) is easier to use to make corner cuts even and strips uniform in length. Use the long edge of the card for the longer strips and the short edge for the shorter ones.

, Cut strips of approximately 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) from each corner down the end and the sides for as long as the material lies flat.









These strips don't have to be exactly uniform, but they should be approximately the same size. Small irregularities will not be noticeable in the finished product.
An easy way to measure is by using your thumb. If your fingers are larger, use the width of your thumb, if your fingers are smaller, use from tip to first knuckle.

, Using a simple knot, attach the bottom layer to the top layer.








, If you have trouble getting the knot tight due to arthritic or weak fingers, hold the end of one tail of the knotted pair with one hand and slide the fingers of the other hand up to push the knot tighter.








, Don't worry if the fleece puckers.








, Use flat hands to stretch and smooth the material so it lies flat again.








, Flatten as needed.








, Move the fleece down so that more of the material lies flat (trimming if needed) and repeat steps #6 through #8 until about 2/3 of the blanket is tied.








, Spread the blanket out so that the remaining end is flat.








, Repeat from step #5 until blanket is finished.









Notice how all those little imperfections seem to magically blend into the pattern.
Fold blanket, place into gift bag(see tips), and tie handles together with ribbon.
Give it someone who will appreciate it, or give it to yourself and make good use of it.

Choose your flannel fabric.,
Pin the two pieces of fabric together, wrong sides facing out.,
Sew around the fabric, but leave a gap for turning.,
Clip the corners.,
Turn your blanket right side out through the gap.,
Press the seams with an iron.,
Topstitch around the blanket, including the gap.Use a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Flannel Throw Blanket2," You will need two pieces of flannel fabric, 2¼ yards (2.1 meters) each.It needs to be about 44 to 45 inches (1.2 meters) wide. You can use two different solid colors, two different patterns, or a solid color and a pattern.

, Spread your first piece of fabric down on the floor, right side up. Place your second piece of fabric on top, right side down. Make sure that the long edges match up with the long edges, and the short edges match up with the short edges. Pin the two pieces together along the edges.

, Sew around the blanket using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins as you sew. Leave a gap in one edge that is big enough for you to turn the fabric inside out. It needs to be about ¼ to ½ the length of one edge., Try to get as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting through it. This will help reduce bulk, and make your blanket lay smoother.

, Use something blunt, but pointy, like a pencil or knitting needle, to push out the corners. This will make them nice and crisp.

, Be sure to use a flannel or cotton setting. When you reach the gap, carefully tuck the raw edges into the blanket so that they match up with the rest of the hems. If you need to, use pins to keep the gap closed.

, You can use matching or contrasting thread colors for the topstitching. A matching thread color will blend in more easily, but a contrasting thread color will make a nice design.


If you need to, use sewing pins to hold the gap shut. Remember to remove the pins while you sew.

Be sure there is an actual tag.,
Look at the price.,
Check the fabric blend.,
Look at the country of manufacture.,
Check the brand name.,
Check the ply.,
Don't get confused by descriptors.",How to Buy a Cashmere Blanket2," If you are buying a wool or textile product within the United States, the Federal Trade Commission (or FTC) requires that the manufacturer have a proper label on it that lists the fiber content, country of origin, and the manufacturer's or responsible company's identity in order to protect the consumer.If you do not see a tag at all, or if the tag on the item is nothing but a sticker, or the tag's authenticity seems questionable (perhaps it is pinned on with a safety pin, or the tag is a large piece of paper with handwriting on it), reconsider making a purchase., Cashmere is an expensive wool to produce because it costs companies so much to get it: for every two pounds of cashmere, which is enough wool to make around 3 sweaters, it costs companies about $100 on the supply end.So even before a company has to start factoring in the cost of labor, overhead, and a margin for profit, there's a high cost involved. The only way to cut that price is if the producer combines the cashmere fibers with another, cheaper fiber. If the price tag seems too good to be true, then it probably is.


Depending on the brand and whether the blanket is 100% cashmere or a cashmere blend, the price will likely vary. For a 50/50 wool and cashmere blend blanket, you might pay between $112 and $200. A 100% cashmere throw could cost anywhere between $250 and $1200.

, The Textile or Wool Act and Rules requires that products be labeled to show the exact fiber content with names and percentages by weight for each constituent fiber, with the exception of fibers that make up less than 5% of a product.This means that you should know exactly what you're getting when you make a purchase. If price is not a mitigating factor, you will want to select a blanket that has a higher percentage of cashmere to other fibers, with 100% or All Cashmere being the ideal, and something like 95% Cashmere to 75% Cashmere being adequate.

, Some industry experts like to use the country of manufacture to determine what they buy. If a brand's goods originate in Japan or Europe, particularly Scotland and Italy which have long been considered the best of the best for spinning and knitting cashmere, that tends to be a good sign of quality. On the other hand, while China does turn out some items of decent quality, by and large their manufacturing for cashmere has only taken off in the last 30 or so years; they still lack the finesse of high-end luxury mills elsewhere., You'll want to see that the manufacturer's label of the blanket in question has the brand name of a large, recognizable company with a good reputation for quality cashmere. Banana Republic, J.Crew, Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Nordstroms are among the list of retailers that sell items at a price-point many people will find more affordable, but Saks 5th Avenue, Queen of Cashmere, and Loro Piana sell quality cashmere for a steeper price point., Ply refers to the number of threads of yarn twisted together to make a single strand.Because this twisting offsets the turns in the single bit of yarn, two-ply yarn or fabric is considered to be better than a single ply. However, two-ply is the ideal: subsequent plies (3-ply and 4-ply) don't really add any extra quality, only extra potential for color and weight (in addition to an increased price). Unless you need the extra warmth a 4-ply blanket can offer, or you've fallen in love with its particular color and look, there's no reason you couldn't go with a cheaper 2-ply blanket.

, Some of the terminology thrown around can be confusing: a lot of people seem to want to refer to ""pashmina"" and ""cashmere"" interchangeably. However, this is misleading: ""pashmina"" simply refers to ""wool fabric,"" not specifically to cashmere.While a blanket could theoretically be 100% cashmere if it is made out of pashmina, that is not a guarantee--it could also be a cashmere blend, or not even cashmere at all.


If you find a blanket, especially online, being sold for less than these prices and described as ""cashmere plush,"" or ""cashmere soft,"" take a careful look at the product description and customers' feedback: chances are it is not cashmere at all but a synthetic fiber.

Familiarize yourself with knitting, casting on and casting off if you do not know how to perform these tasks.

,
Cast on the desired number of stitches.,
Twist the yarn into a loop around your index finger and wrap the loop over the top of the needle.,
Begin to knit your blanket using a garter stitch.,
Start knitting your squares.,
Sew your squares together as your accumulate them.,
Cast off your stitches by pushing the left needle into the stitch you knitted first, pulling it over the second stitch, and finally completely off the needle.

,
Bind off the remaining stitches and trim any loose ends.",How to Make a Blanket2,", These cast on loops will serve as the foundation for your knitting squares.

, Pull the loop tight on the needle.


If you are using size 7, 8, 9 or 10 needles, cast-on about 150 stitches to make a medium-sized blanket. If using a size 11, 12 or 13 needle, cast on between 70 to 80 stitches. For even larger needles, cast on between 60 and 70 stitches.

, Knit squares to the size that you want and then knit the squares together to build your blanket.

, Use any type of wool or yarn that you choose.

, First create long rows of squares and then assemble the rows together.

,, Tie the end of the yarn into a knot and push it back through a stitch with your needle.

"
"
Choose your yarn and crochet hook size.,
Decide whether you want to make a single crochet or a double crochet blanket.,
Make a foundation chain of stitches along your needle.,
To make a single crochet stitch, wrap the end of the yarn around the hook.,
At the end of the row, flip your work so that the last stitch made is now the first stitch to be worked for the next row.,
Continue this process until you have about a foot of yarn left.,
Cut the leftover yarn down to about six inches and thread it through your needle, pulling it through the last loop on your crochet hook.",How to Make a Blanket3," You will need 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket and 6-8 skeins for a larger throw blanket.


Crochet hooks range in size from B to S, with S being the largest. The bigger the hook, the larger the stitch.

, The single crochet is the easier of the two, so beginners should learn the single crochet before attempting the double crochet.

, Slide a slipknot onto the crochet hook, wrap the yarn around the hook from the back to the front and draw a new loop through the knot.

, Start behind the hook and come over the hook and then draw it underneath.


For a double crochet, insert the hook under the fourth loop from the hook. Yarn over the hook and pull it through the center of the chain. Then yarn over the hook and draw the yarn through the first two loops from the hook. Repeat for the last two loops on the hook.

, Work from left to right.

, You can switch colors whenever you get to the end of a row before flipping your work if you like.

, Incorporate any loose ends into the blanket with small stitches before trimming the ends.

Choose your template and your fabric.,
Transfer your template to your fabric and cut out the squares.,
Sew each square together leaving a 1/4-inch seam allowance.,
Baste the quilted squares, batting, and backing together.,
Sew the quilt together starting from the middle and working out.,
Remove the temporary stitches that you used to hold together the three layers.,
Add borders to the quilt if you want them.",How to Make a Blanket4," You can either create a template using graph paper or find a free template online. You can use as many different patterns/colors of fabric as you like to make your quilt.

, Use a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat to achieve squares as precise as possible.

, Use a sewing machine to sew the squares into your desired pattern.

, Sew the three layers together with a simple stitch in each corner of the quilt. You will remove this stitch later.


Fusible batting needs to be ironed to the other two layers, but regular batting does not.

, Follow the seams in the quilt block and keep a 1/4-inch seam allowance between your stitching and the seam.

, You should be able to easily cut out the stitches using scissors.

, Sew long strips of fabric to the outside border of the quilt to create a more complex, polished pattern.

Obtain canvas webbing with a minimum of 1/4 inch openings.,
Cut your fabric into pieces.,
Sketch the design you want onto the canvas mesh.,
Hook your rag strips onto the canvas in the manner of a hooked rug.",How to Make a Rag Rug1," This is available in larger opening sizes as well from most sewing and craft stores. Most will have canvas webbing with drawn-on patterns to guide your color choices.


If you buy a kit, it'll show and/or give you everything you need. Just follow the directions on the box when it comes to choosing a hook and fabric.;
, The size you choose will depend on your webbing. If you can, be e-co friendly by using recycled fabrics such as old clothing. Cut them into strips that are a maximum of 1/2"" (1.25 cm) in width and 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) in length. Keeping the lengths uniform results in a smooth ""pile"" for your rug.









Trimming later is time consuming and more difficult than cutting to uniform length at this point. Once you cut one, just use it as a prototype and match the rest.

, That is, of course, if the canvas didn't come with a pattern on it already. Permanent markers work well for this; just take care not to get marker on any surface underneath the canvas.









Having a pattern isn't necessary. If you'd like to create an abstract masterpiece, go right ahead! It'll be just as beautiful.

, In a couple of hours, you'll have a new rug all your own. Ta da! No glue, sewing machine, or real skill required.

Move your middle finger loop to your ring finger.,
Repeat the process in ""Starting Off Your Blanket,"" beginning with step three.,
Finish your blanket.",How to Finger Knit a Blanket," To begin finger knitting, you'll first need to take a ball of yarn, and unravel a foot or so of the yarn. You will then place the strand of yarn that you have unraveled between your thumb and pointer finger, with the end of your yarn inside your palm and the rest of the yarn falling over the back of your hand. Hold the yarn in place with your thumb, leaving three inches of yarn or so across your palm.;
, Begin by first facing your palm upwards and using the yarn that is on the back of your hand, wind it under your pointer finger, and then over your middle finger. Then wind it under your ring finger and over your pinky finger. When you look at your hand with your palm facing up you should see a loop of yarn around your middle and pinky finger.Wind the yarn back the opposite direction. Taking the yarn that you looped over your pinky, you will wind it around the back of your pinky, creating a complete loop, and then over your ring finger. Then, wind the yarn behind your middle finger and over your pointer finger.

, You will then do the same process another time, first winding the yarn behind your pointer finger, over your middle finger, under your ring finger, and over your pinky. Then wind back the other direction around your pinky, over your ring finger, under your middle finger and back over your pointer finger.


When you wind the second time around you want to wind above the previous loops you created. After you have winded around your fingers twice, you should see two loops across each finger.
If you find that your loops are loose, you can pull the end of the yarn between your thumb and pointer finger, which will tighten the loops around your fingers.

, After you have looped around your fingers, you will take the bottom loop on each of your fingers and bring it over the top loop, and then pull it over the top of your finger. Once you have done this on each finger you should then only see one loop on each finger. This will create the first ""stitch"" in your knitting.


If you need to, you can tighten the loops again by pulling on the end of the yarn. To prepare for the next knitting, push the loops to the bottom of your fingers.

, Because your yarn should have ended at your pointer finger, you'll have to start the next part of the knitting by looping over your middle finger. Then, loop under your ring finger and back over your pinky finger.


Repeat this process going the opposite direction. Just as you did in the previous steps, go back the opposite direction, starting by looping the yarn around your pinky finger, over your ring finger, under your middle finger, and then over and around your pointer finger. Now you should have two loops around your fingers again.Pull the bottom loop over your fingers. Repeating the previous step, you will again pull the bottom loop on your finger over the top loop, and then all the way over your finger, creating one loop each on each finger.

, At this point you have wound the yarn around your fingers and pulled the loops over a couple of times. Now, you will repeat the process of looping under and over your fingers and then bringing the bottom loop over the top loop until you have created your desired size for your project.


Make sure you continue to push the loops down on your fingers so they don't pop off the top of your fingers.

, Once you have reached your desired length, you will finish your knitting project by bringing the loop from your pointer finger up and over your finger and then onto your middle finger. Then, take the bottom loop on your middle finger and bring it up and over the top loop and then over your middle finger.


At this point you'll want to pull your yarn tightly to make sure the loops are pulled into the knitting.
Take the remaining loop from the middle finger and move it over the next finger. Just as you did with your pointer finger, you will take the remaining loop on your middle finger and pull it up and over your finger and onto your ring finger. Then, take the bottom loop of your ring finger, and move it up and over the top loop and the top of your finger.

, Lastly, you will take the remaining loop on your ring finger and bring it up and over your finger and onto your pinky finger. Then, taking the bottom loop on your pinky, bring it up and over the top loop and over your finger, leaving one loop on your pinky.

, Once you have one final loop left, you will remove it from your pinky, making sure you don't pull the loop out. Then, cut the remaining yarn off from the yarn ball. Bring the end of the yarn through the loop and pull it to tighten and create a knot.


To finish your chain, pull both ends of your yarn to tighten. At this point you should be left with a piece of yarn sticking out of both ends of the chain. To hide yarn, you can weave the ends of the yarn back through the knitting and cut the ends off so that they won't be noticeable.

, To finger knit a blanket you will need yarn of any color (it is helpful to have bulky or weighty yarn so that the blanket will be thicker) and scissors. It can be beneficial to have a stitch holder to hold your stitch in place if you don't knit in one setting, and a crotchet hook used to pull the loops over your fingers.


The amount of yarn depends on the size of blanket you want. You may have to use several balls of yarn and tie them together at the ends if one ball is not enough (which it most likely won't be).

, Now that you know how to finger stitch, to begin your blanket you'll need to finger knit as previously explained until you achieve the desired length of your blanket. After you have reached your desired length, instead of tying it off, you will leave the final loop. This is what you will use to create width for your blanket.


Essentially your blanket will be many rows (the number depends on the length of the blanket your desire) of the finger knits lined up next to one another.

, Take the one loop that you left on your knitting chain and place it around your pointer finger. Turn your knitting over onto the backside. Your knitting will usually curl up a little, with the front curling towards the back. To find the back, lay out your chain and find the side that has its sides curling towards the back. This is the front, so you'll want to flip it over for the backside.


If you can't find a backside, don't sweat it. It affects the look of the blanket somewhat but it won't affect the actual knitting process.

, With the rest of your yarn, you'll want to loop it around your fingers. To do this, place the yarn in front of your middle finger (palm side), then slide your thumb underneath the yarn with your thumb moving towards your palm. Then, twist your thumb upwards until the yarn forms into a loop. Move the loop behind your middle finger, and then place it over your middle finger.As you are making the loop you might have to hold onto the cross section of the loop with your hand so that the loop doesn't come undone.

, Using the same technique to create the loop around your middle finger, you will create similar loops around your ring and pinky fingers.


If you turn your hand around on the knuckle side when you've finished what you should see is one loop just around your pointer finger, and then a line of yarn coming from your chain that crosses over your middle finger. Then, on your middle finger you should see that line of yarn, and underneath there should be a line of yarn that crosses over your middle finger and your ring finger. On your ring finger you should see that line of yarn, and then underneath that a line of yarn that crosses over your ring finger and pinky finger.
Essentially the yarn loops are stacked, meaning the yarn starts higher on your pointer finger and by the time it gets to your pinky finger it is two levels lower than the yarn loop on your pointer and middle finger.

, After you've looped the yarn around your fingers, you will lay your working yarn (the string of yarn still connected to the yarn ball) over the insides of your fingers (the palm side) going from your pinky to your pointer finger. Then, as you have done earlier, take the bottom loop on each finger and pull it up over the top strand of yarn. Once you have done this you should be left with one loop on each finger.

, Now that you have done a few stitches, it's time to start turning the blanket so you can achieve your desired width. Taking your chain of yarn, follow the outside edge, and look for a loop two stitches down. Then, pull that loop over your pointer finger. As you look at your chain of yarn, you should see many loops going across it. Essentially you want to use the loop on the outermost part of the chain, but the loop will have two strands of yarn in it. Do not place your finger through the outermost strands of yarn, but place it through the loop that those two strands of yarn are a part of. When you pull it over your finger, you should have one larger loop that is made up of two smaller loops (or two strands of yarn).

, Take your working yarn and place it over your fingers, above the preexisting loops. Then, on your pointer finger, pull the middle loop (the one that you just put onto your pointer finger) over your working yarn and up and over your finger, pulling it tight. Then, pull the bottom loop over the top loop you just created on your pointer finger.

, You will repeat this same process by pulling the loops on your middle, ring, and pinky fingers up and over the working yarn, creating one loop on each finger.

, Take your working yarn (it should be beside your pinky finger now) and place it back over the inside of your fingers, above the remaining loops. Then, pull each loop up and over the working yarn and over your fingers to create one loop on each finger.

, Take your chain, and look for the outside loop that is two away from the one already on your finger (not the loop right next to it but the one after that). Then, place that loop over your pointer finger as you did in a previous step, knitting as before by pulling the second loop up and over your working yarn, then pulling the bottom loop on your pointer finger over the loop you just created.


Continue to do this with all of your fingers, as you did in the previous steps, creating one loop on each finger. Finish the second row by laying the working yarn from your pinky finger over the inside of your fingers, above the preexisting loops, and pulling the loops over the working yarn, creating one loop on each of your fingers.

, To continue adding width to your blanket, after you create loops going across your fingers both directions, you'll add another loop from your chain to your pointer finger and continue the exact same process. Once you have finished that loop, you'll add another one until you go down the entire length of the chain, with only one loop left to do.


Make sure you don't add the loop right next to the one you are working with. Each time you add a loop you'll want to skip the loop next to yours and use the one right after it.

, Take the last loop and put it over your pointer finger. Pull both loops on your pointer finger over the working yarn. Then, pull the loop from your middle finger over the working yarn, but instead of continuing to your ring finger, you will pull the middle finger loop up and over your finger onto your pointer finger. Then pull the bottom loop on your pointer finger over the top loop (the loop you just added)., After you have moved the pointer finger loop to your middle finger, take your working yarn and pull the loop on your ring finger over the yarn. Then, take that loop and pull it over your ring finger onto your middle finger. Take the bottom loop on your middle finger and pull it over the top loop you just added.

, Pull the last loop on your pinky finger over the working yarn. Then pull that loop up and over your pinky finger onto your ring finger. Pull the bottom loop of your ring finger over the top loop and you should be left with one final loop. Move that loop to your pointer finger.

, You will continue to follow this process and move onto the knitting process of your blanket, repeating the steps previously mentioned until you have gone down the entire chain again. Then, bind off your chain, and continue onto your next chain, creating the desired width of your blanket.


At this point, you will probably need to flip your blanket over, so that the side you are working on is closest to you. As you complete each chain, bind it off and then flip your blanket over.

, After you have knitted your desired width of your blanket, create the last binding loop, and then cut the working yarn remaining from that loop. Then, put the end of the yarn through the loop, pull tightly so that it creates a knot, and weave through your blanket to hide the remaining yarn.

Consider cutting the fabric about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer and wider than you want it to be. You will be cutting strips into the fabric, and then tying the strips into knots. This will cause the blanket to ""shrink"" slightly.

, Trim it down so that it is 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) smaller than all four sides of your fleece pieces. Sandwich the batting between the fleece pieces. Make sure that it is centered, so that there is a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) fleece border all around the batting.

, The right sides should be facing outward. You will be using knots to ""sew"" the blanket, so you won't have to turn it inside out.

Pinning the two pieces together will help keep things even.

, Use sharp fabric scissors, and be sure to cut through both layers of fleece. This will help create nice, sharp corners once the blanket is done.

You can discard the squares you cut out, or save them for another project. You won't need them for the blanket anymore.

, The slits should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) deep. Be sure to cut through both layers of fleece. You will end up with a fringe all around your blanket.

Use a ruler to make the measurements exact. If you need to draw some guidelines, use a fabric marker. The ink will either disappear over time or when you wash the blanket.

, Take the bottom piece and the top piece and tie them in any knot you like. Try tying the first knot loosely, and the second knot tighter. This will help the blanket keep its shape. Start at one end of the blanket, and go all the way around until you are done.

Make sure that you are tying the top strip to the corresponding bottom strip.
There is no need to flip the blanket inside out. The knots are part of the decoration.

Cut your fabric into strips that are the width of your finished rug.,
Pull the ends of the strips slightly to make them curl along their long edges.,
Lay the slightly curled strips side by side with their ends even.,
Machine stitch the strips together perpendicular to the lay of the strips.,
Sew parallel lines, too.",How to Make a Rag Rug2," This method will be assuming you're making a fairly standard rectangular rug. However, it's up to you whether or not you want a fringe on the edge.









If you have some rags you'd like to use but are too short, just sew 'em together! The beauty of the rag rug is in the idiosyncrasies, not the perfections.

, This gives your rag rug volume, texture, and character. Who knew a rug could have character? Well, yours will, that's for sure.








, Do this now to see how the colors and patterns line up. You may not like how the shades frame each other and need to adjust before you make everything permanent.








, That's right; perpendicular. This makes the rug sturdy and gives it interesting visual lines.









Though you could sew away throwing caution to the wind, you may want to keep your lines evenly spaced. Every 1"" - 1 1/2"" (2.5-3.75 cm) is ideal.

, You may have some edges that look like they need to be shown their place; in that case, turn your rug 90 degrees and start sewing parallel lines. These can be spaced at your discretion.









You can have lines as little as 1/4"" (.6 cm) apart. If you think it looks good, go for it. But if you have lines that are 6"" (15 cm) apart, know that your rug risks falling apart a bit more, since it's lacking structure.

"
"
Cut your fabric into strips of equal width.,
Sew all the strips end to end to make three long strips.,
Braid the strips together tightly.,
Once you reach the end, coil up the braid.,
Sew the finished braids together.",How to Make a Rag Rug3," Somewhere around 3"" (7.5 cm) is perfect. You'll need what can only be called ""loads"" of fabric, so cut strips that are as long as possible. You'll only know if you need more fabric at the very end, once the rug is coiled together and the size becomes apparent.


Different fabrics will braid differently. Because you're braiding, it's easy to add more fabric if you've run out and your rug still isn't big enough. So don't fret! You'll cross that bridge when you come to it.

, Don't worry about the colors or material matching -- you just need three super long strips to work with.









Once you have your strips consolidated into three mega-strips, hand or machine sew the three short ends at the top together. This will be the simplest starting point.

, This'll be easiest if you can devise a way to hang the strips so you can stand while braiding your feet upon feet of fabric. A clothespin will be handy in keeping the braid together.









Braid it tightly! You don't want holes in your rug, do you?

, Start from the beginning and spiral out. If the rug is big enough, great! You're finished with braiding and can move onto sewing it into its circular shape. If it's not big enough, simply sew on a few more fabric strips to elongate your three master strips and continue the braiding process.









You don't necessarily have to coil it up and make a circle rug, but it's definitely easy and looks neat. A snake-like rectangle works, too, but takes a bit more sewing mastery on the edges.
If you had to join on a few more strips, continue braiding until you reach the new ends. Coil it up once more -- is it large enough now? Great! Moving on.

, Uncoil the rug and work from the very center. Sew along the inside edges to join the braid with the length of fabric that surrounds it, going around and around and around. Coil up your rug as you go, following with your string.









You may have to make some reinforcements once you've finished. The beauty of the rag rug is that none of these will be seen! As long as you sew on the insides, you're golden. Just add a few touch ups here and there in the same demeanor you did initially. Et voila!

Place the last piece of iron-on seam tape inside the top edge of your blanket and trim it down to fit.,
Iron the hole shut, and remove the pins.",How to Make a No Sew Blanket2," It does not matter what type of fabric you use, as you will be using seam tape to fuse them together. You can use the same color for both pieces, or contrasting colors. You can even choose a pattern for one piece, and a solid color for the other.

, Make sure that both pieces match up perfectly. You can make the blanket as large or as small as you like, but keep in mind that most fabric rarely comes wider than 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).

, Two of the pieces need to be the same width as your fabric. The other two pieces need to be the same length as your fabric. If you can't find any iron-on seam tape, you can try using fabric glue instead. Keep in mind, however, that the glue will make your fabric stiffer.

, You will be using it later.

, Make sure that you are folding inward, towards the wrong side. Also, make sure that you are folding one of the narrow ends, not the wide. These folded parts will make the ""opening"" to your blanket, so that you can later ""hem"" it shut.

, Make sure that the folded part is facing upwards, away from you.

, Do not place any iron-on seam tape on the top, folded edge. If you need to, pin the iron-on seam tape in place. Stick the pins vertically into the fabric, with the ball/head part sticking out beyond the edge of the fabric. This way, you can pull them out.

, Make sure that the folded top edge is facing away from you. It should be aligned with the folded top edge of the bottom fabric. If you need to, pin the two pieces of fabric together.

, Set your iron to the temperature specified by packaging from the iron-on seam tape. Run it over the bottom and side edges of your blanket. If you don't have the packaging anymore, then set your iron to the appropriate setting for the fabric you are using.

, Remember the hole you left along the top edge of the fabric? Pull your blanket through that hole. The seams should now be on the inside. The folded part should also be on the inside.

, If you plan on using your blanket as a duvet cover, skip this step. Consider using a quilt batting made out of polyester; it is more likely to keep its shape than a cotton or wool one.

, Make sure that you place it right between the two folded edges. Align the top edge of the seam tape with the top edge of the blanket. Pin the tape in place, if necessary.


If you want to completely close your blanket, trim the tape down so it fits the length of the hole.
If you'd like to use your blanket as a duvet cover, trim the tape down to two pieces about the width of your hand. Place the tape at the outer sides of the hole. You will simply be making the hole smaller.

, Make sure your iron it set to the right temperature, then run it over the edges of the hole. When you are done, remove the pins.

Obtain denim and flannel material.,
Rip the denim and flannel into rectangles and squares.,
Sew the equal-sized flannel and denim squares/rectangles together with the back sides together and front sides facing out.,
Begin to sew the stack of denim and flannel squares together in strips when you have a stack of them sewn.,
Sew the strips long edges together, with flannel sides together.,
Add strips to whichever edge of your ""blanket"" you choose.,
Sew a zigzag or satin stitch around the entire perimeter of the blanket, approximately 1.5 inches or 4 cm from the edge.,
Finish the chenille process by clipping each of the seam allowances to within a quarter inch (0.5 cm) of the seam.,
Wash and dry the blanket to fray your chenille.

,
Cut any long strings off.,
Enjoy your cozy new blanket!

",How to Make a Chenille Denim Blanket," You may do this by collecting old jeans, or you can buy denim yardage if you prefer. In most cases, old jeans are better as they are a cheap and easily available source of material. A cheap source of flannel could be to use an old flannel sheet, but you may also purchase it new at a fabric shop.


Wash and dry the fabrics.;
, Make the rectangles or squares a minimum of 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) wide (the width of the pant leg is usually sufficient). You can get a rip started by cutting a slit in the seam, cutting in the direction you want the material to tear.


The object of tearing the material into the desired size is to begin the fraying process. You could also cut the material to shape and let the washing machine do the fraying for you later.

, Sew diagonally from corner to corner and not around the perimeter. The purpose is to baste the materials together, so don't panic if your seams are not perfect.

, Do this by sewing the squares together with the flannel sides together and leaving a 1.5 inch (4 cm) seam allowance. For added seam strength, sew each seam twice.

, Be sure to leave the wide seam allowance. You may choose to miter the seam ends to make it easier for your sewing machine to handle the thick material.

, You can be quite random about this, so long as the edge you are about to sew is the same length of the strip you wish to sew it to. Always sew with flannel sides together and leave a wide seam allowance (it is recommend that you keep the seam allowance fairly consistent, but it can vary as much as .5 cm or a quarter of an inch with no problems).

, Do this when the blanket reaches your desired size.

, Make your clips approximately half an inch or (1.5 cm) apart. Clip all the seam allowances. You may also choose to clip the outer edge up to your zigzag seam.,, Be sure to clean out your dryer's lint trap, as it will be full by now.

Use machine needles that are thick enough to cope with layers of fabric.,
Oil your sewing machine regularly during the making of each soft toy.,
Slow down!",How to Prepare a Sewing Machine for Making Soft Toys," Unlike the normal clothes sewing process, sewing soft toys often requires the sewing of layers using fabric that can be quite thick, such as fur, felt, corduroy or thick cotton.;
, This will help it to cope with the additional strain.

, Do your stitching more slowly when sewing through thicker fabric or through felt. This will help to ensure that the strain on the machine is less and that you don't end up with bunched up fabric clogging the needles.

Decide what your monster is going to look like; will he have wings, horns, teeth, a tongue, or extra arms and legs?,
Lay your material out in front of you.,
Make the necessary cuts for the head.,
Make the necessary cuts for the neck.,
Make the necessary cuts for the arms, which will usually be a vertical line at the bottom of the sock with the cuts for the neck or a vertical line down the top of the second sock from the middle of the toe to about 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) below the heel.,
The cuts for the legs are almost self-explanatory.,
Make the cuts for any accessories or other limbs your monster might need.,

Sew buttons on the monster or glue googly eyes on him so he can see.,
Stuff the monster, starting with his ears, moving to his face, then his neck, then his arms then his torso, tail, and lastly his legs.",How to Sew a Sock Monster," Will he have a mohawk or long ears? What do you think his personality will be like; will he be shy and introverted, or crazy and extroverted?
, You will usually need two socks to create monsters, and you will almost always have plenty of extra scraps at the end of another monster's creation which will be useful for future projects; keep them safe and sound just in case. Your socks should be laying with their heels pointing up towards the ceiling.

For the monster that this article will specifically show you how to make (his name is Quiggley), you will need two socks, preferably the same, but if not, socks of similar fabrics and complimentary patterns will be the best. The socks should have colored heels and toes.

, If he's going to have ears, make the cuts accordingly.

Quiggley will need 2 slits on the side of the top of the heel and in the middle.

, It's easiest to cut a 2 1⁄2 inch (6.4 cm) vertical line 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) underneath the heel and two small slits on the sides.

Follow the above instructions for Quiggley's neck.

,

Quiggley has short arms with little 'mittens' which are made from the colored top part of the heel. You make his arms by cutting a vertical line starting at the center of the toe and ending 3 inches (7.6 cm) below the heel. From there, you cut a horizontal line across the bottom of the previous cut to separate the arms from the sock. Turn the arms wrong-side-out and stitch the edges together to from the very edge of the 'mitten' to the corner, but not the top, as it needs to be attached to the monster and stuffed.

, All that is needed is a vertical cut down any of the two places the arms could be cut, except a bit longer.

Quiggley's legs are cut from the bottom of the 'body' sock (the one that has the neck cuts). Cut a vertical line starting from the bottom center of the sock to less than halfway up the tube. Sew from the very bottom part of the leg to about 2 inches (5.1 cm) below the top so they can be stuffed and so you don't close the stuff-hole.

,

Quiggley has two large ears that are made from the very bottom part of the sock you used to make the arms. Cut a vertical line in the center where the arms stop and sew from the cuff up to the edge leaving the very top part open to sew it on and stuff it.

, The easiest way to do this is to turn the limp/appendage right-side-out and to stick in the appropriate opening, pinning the edges together and stitching around it. Pull the limb/appendage out and it will be wrong-side-out like the rest of the monster.

Follow the above instructions for Quiggley's arms and ears, being careful not to rip the seam when pulling the limb out.

, There can be as many or as little as you'd like, but try to make them compliment each other. A bunch of different buttons starts to look less like eyes and more like a bunch of buttons., Add any last minute stuffing and use a ladder stitch to sew the stuff-hole closed.

If the sock proves to be too short, you will need to use scrap materials for the ears, tail and legs. It's not a problem if you'd rather use different materials anyway.;
, Cut off the toe end., This will leave you with two pieces to form the dog's ears. Put to one side., Just a little over halfway down the length of the sock (the part that doesn't form the toe end), cut the sock. This will remove the end and forms the dog's body piece.

When determining how long to make the dog's body, bear in mind that the cut-off section must be sufficient to form the dog's legs and tail pieces (see next). This is why a long sock is essential.

,

Cut a piece straight across that measures about 2 inches (5cm). This forms the tail piece. Cut into a tapered piece with a wide base and a thin tip, just as a dog's tail looks.
Cut the remaining piece into four equally sized squares. These will form the leg pieces.

, This closes off the front end of the dog, its head., Fill with your filling of choice, such as craft supply fill or homemade fill made from scraps, pantyhose, etc., As you stitch, follow the taper of the tail so that it is larger one end and has a small tip at the other end. Leave a small section open for stuffing. Stuff it with filling, then stitch together.

When stuffing the tail, use a needle to help push the filling right up into the tip. The filling will help the tail to stand upright when attached to the dog.

, Sew the square pieces together, making them as rounded as you can for the legs. Leave a small portion and fill with stuffing then sew together.

As you stuff the legs, pull them into roughly the same shape each and use the filling to round out the leg shape.

, Place the tail at the end of the dog (what was the open leg end). Have the wide end against the dog's body and the thin tip facing up into the air, forming a convex arc (like a bowl). Stitch in place.

Be sure that the stitches are firm. Pull on the tail to test its resilience and add more stitches if needed.

, Place the four legs evenly around the base of the dog's body and stitch in place., Or, you could use a combination of both. Either is fine., You could either embroider eyes in place, just simple black circles or a large white circle with a small black circle for the pupil. Or, stitch buttons or googly eyes in place., This is easy to either embroider on or to glue on a red felt smile cut from felt fabric., Either embroider a black or brown nose tip or sew on a craft nose or a button., If wished, make a ribbon loop around the dog's neck, using wide ribbon for a collar.

, on the soft toys. There are many suitable threads, ranging from embroidery floss, wool, and strands of silk. Be imaginative and use up bits and pieces that you have ferreted away for some time.

, The thread used for seams should match the colour of the soft toy's fabric. The seams show once the toy is stuffed, so the closest possible colour match is important. Where matching proves difficult, select a slightly lighter shade of thread.

Cut a 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) wide strip of fabric according to that measurement.If you are using fabric that does not fray, such as fleece or cotton jersey, you can cut it so that it's 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide instead.
If you have a pre-made ruffle, cut it down to the length specified, then click here.;
, Fold the strip of fabric in half lengthwise with the right sides facing out. Press it flat with an iron as you fold so that you get a nice, crisp edge. When you are done, you should have a double-sided strip of fabric that's 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) wide.


If you cut a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) wide strip of non-fray fabric, skip this step.

, Sew along the raw edge using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance first. Then, sew another row of stitch right next to it, this time using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.Use a straight stitch and a long stitch length for both rows. Do not backstitch., Grab hold of both of the bobbin threads on one side of your strip. Gently tug on it while pushing the fabric back with your other hand.Stop when it is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) longer than the perimeter of your blanket. You will need this extra inch (2.54 centimeters) to overlap and sew the two ends together.


From time to time, switch over to the other end of the strip, and gather that side as well. Remember to only pull on the bobbin threads.

, Once the strip is the right length, cut the threads down to a manageable length. Tie them into tight, secure knots, then snip off the excess. Your ruffle is now ready to attach!

, Make sure that the raw edges of the ruffle match up with the raw edges of the blanket. You want the folded edge of the ruffle to be facing towards the middle of the blanket., Fold one of the edges inward by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) so that it is still tube-shaped and has a smooth, folded edge all around. Tuck the other edge in by about ½-inch (1.27-centimeter). Sew the seam down using a ladder stitch or a straight stitch and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance.


If you are using non-fray fabric, you can simply overlap the two ends by about ½-inch (1.27-centimeter). You can stitch them down using a straight stitch, or leave them be.

, Make sure that you place the second piece right side down, so that the ruffle is sandwiched inbetween.If you are adding a ruffle to a single-sided blanket or an existing blanket, you can skip this step.

, Make sure that you backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. If you are sewing a double-sided blanket, leave a 12 to 18-inch (30.48 to 45.72-centimeter) gap along one of the edges so that you can turn your blanket inside out., Use something pointy, like a knitting needle, to help push out the corners. Press the edges flat with an iron.


If you are adding a ruffle to a one-sided blanket or an existing blanket, fold the ruffles outward and the seams inward. Press the seams flat.

Catch a loop of yarn, then pull it back through the stitch., Keep a hold on the tail as you work, or you will accidentally pull your ruffle off of your work., This seems like a lot of stitches, especially for a single edge stitch. These double crochets will flare out eventually, however, resulting in a ruffle., You are doing three this time around because the initial chain counted as a double crochet., Do three double crochets in each stitch. Stop when you are one stitch away the corner., There are two ways that you can do this. The simplest way is to simply keep going, and do three double crochets in the stitch to the left of the corner, and three more double crochets in the stitch to the right of the corner. Alternatively, you can do six double crochets in the gap just under the corner., When you are back to where you started, join your last double crochet to the first chain with a slip stitch., Cut the yarn down, then pull the tail back through the loop. Gently tug on the tail to tighten the knot, then weave the tail back into your work using a yarn needle.

Choose your yarn color.,
Cast on twice as many stitches as the edge you wish to add the ruffle to.,
Knit in stockinette until the ruffle is the height you want it to be.,
Knit a row of decreasing stitches.,
Purl the next row.,
Cast off the final row.,
Finish off the ruffle.,
Knit three more ruffles.,
Bind the ruffles to your blanket.,
Bind the corners of the ruffles.",How to Add a Ruffle Edge to Blankets3," You can use the same color as the rest of your blanket or a contrasting one. You need to use the same weight of yarn, however, because you will be counting stitches.


Because of how big blankets are, it is recommended that you only use this method for small blankets, such as baby blankets.

, Count the number of stitches along the edge you will be adding the ruffle to. Multiply that number by two, then cast on that many stitches onto your knitting needle., The stockinette stitch is where your knit one row and purl the next.Keep knitting until the ruffle is about the length you want it to be, about four rows total., You will be knitting together two stitches for the entire row.Knitting together two stitches is very easy. Simply push your knitting needle through two stitches, then knit them as though they are one stitch. Here is the process in more detail:Push the tip of your right needle through the first two stitches on your left needle so that it comes out the back.
Use your right needle to catch a loop of yarn from behind your work.
Use your right needle to pull the loop through both stitches. Gently pull it tight.
Slip both of the stitches off of your left needle.
Knit together the next two stitches.

, This will prepare you for the final cast off row, which must be done as a knit.

, Start by knitting the first two stitches onto your right needle. Then, use your left needle to catch the first stitch that you knit, pull it over the second stitch, and off of the right needle. Knit another stitch. Again, use your left needle to pull the new first stitch over the new second stitch. Keep doing this until you reach the end of the row.This cast off row is now the bottom edge of your ruffle.

, Cut the yarn, leaving behind a long tail. Pull the tail through the final loop, and tug on it gently to tighten the knot. Do not trim the tail off yet; you will use it to bind the ruffles together.

, Make sure that you cast on the right number of stitches. The top and bottom edges of your blanket may be the same, but the side edges may have a different number of stitches.

, Thread a yarn needle with a yarn color that matches either your blanket or your ruffle. Start sewing the ruffle to the blanket by weaving the needle through the top edge of your blanket and the bottom (gathered) edge of your ruffle. Continue sewing the other ruffles to the other edges.


You will likely run out of yarn at some point. If that happens, simply knot the old yarn off, weave in the end, and thread a new length of yarn.
Make sure that the knit sides are all facing up and the purl sides are fall facing down.

, Thread your yarn needle onto one of the tails leftover from the cast off. Use it to weave the edges of the ruffles together. When you reach the top edge, knot the yarn off, weave it back down the seam, then trim off the excess.

Gather your supplies.,
Check your measurements.,
Sew the white fabrics for the base of your mushroom together.,
Sew the two pieces together.,
Sew the edges on the mushroom topper.,
Pinch sides and sew so it ends up in somewhat of a 'bowl' shape.,
Put the topper own and sew around the edges.,
You're finished!",How to Make Kawaii Mushrooms," Begin by getting everything you need. Just about everything can be obtained from your local craft store. In addition to what's shown below you'll also need a little bit of stuffing which is usually sold in large quantities.;
, You'll need to make sure everything's the right side or else you'll have a quite crooked mushroom.

, You can leave a small opening and then sew that after adding the stuffing.

, To do this you'll need to use a pin to hold the top and bottom together while you sew around the edges in a circular shape.

, The brown circle will later be sewn around the top however for now you will need to sew a circle around the edges. This will be a great guide for the next step.

, It doesn't have to completely fit the top of your mushroom.

, Remember, this will be your final product so be clean with it.

, You can decorate from here, use a mini-tip felt pen an add a face from here or leave it plain and cute as-is.

Use any picture from old magazines, books, etc.,
Make the picture larger or smaller using a photocopier to enlarge or by squaring off with 1"" squares using a ruler.,
Cut two identical pieces for each toy, front and back.,
Stuff with beans or use polyester filling, whichever you prefer.

,
Do not to over-stuff, if you fill with beans.,
Use the eraser end of a pencil to push the stuffing into corners (ears, feet, tail, etc) if you fill with stuffing.

,
Fold the edges in of the remaining seam and sew shut.

,
Embroider or paint a face on with fabric paint.,
Use these two pictures as an example; a Bear and a Bunny, from an old magazine and squared off.,
Finished.

",How to Make Any Beanbag or Small Stuffed Toy," Look for pictures that have rounded edges or round them as you cut. Do not use pictures that will require a lot of attachments. As much as possible try to cut in one piece, only adding ears, perhaps bunny puff tail.;
, Then on larger paper, make 2"" squares and draw the picture into the larger squares copying from the smaller picture. Square off the picture or place on a window with graph over top and trace the picture outline. The same applies to make the picture smaller; use 1/2"" squares (or as big or as small as you wish).

, Remember, you will need at least 1/4"" extra for the seam. Place the two material pieces right side together and sew seam. Bind the seam edges to keep it from unravelling.

,, You will want your toy to be squishy.

,,, You can also use small buttons for eyes, yarn for whiskers or hair, pom pom for hair or tail. Again, remember that these add-ons can be very dangerous for children (or for animals) as they are a choking hazard.

, To cut these out, you need to cut 1/4"" around away from the edge of the picture for your seam. These are a good example of how detailing can be added with embroidery or fabric paint.

Lay out black fabric and fold in two.,
With chalk (or other writing utensil visible on the particular kind of black fabric you have) trace out a human shape.,
Cut out your shape, making sure to leave seam allowances.

,
With the two pieces of fabric lined up on top of each other, wrong sides out, start sewing all around, with a sewing machine or by hand.,
Turn it right side out and insert the stuffing.,
Now cut out an oval shape in the accent colour.,
Sew the oval on the place where you want the ninja face to go.,
Embroider or sew in the eyes.,
Add any details you may like such as embroidering his/her name on the back, adding lashes or a pink (or red or any other coloured) bow to a female ninja, or embroidering a little mouth or sew in a small pink tongue poking out.

",How to Make a Stuffed Ninja," Make sure the right sides are touching each other.;
, It doesn't need to be too perfect, and it looks cuter if it isn't. Just make sure it looks sort of like a person, at the very least, with arms and legs. The easiest shape is a rectangle with tiny stubby arms and legs.

,, Leave a small opening somewhere, to turn it right side out. (1 inch/2.5 cm is good)

, With the back of a pencil or a similar object, push the stuffing in so that your ninja doesn't turn out floppy. Sew the opening closed using blind stitch.

, Skin tones (such as a light pink, white, yellowish, tan or brown shades) work best to make a more life-like ninja but you can use any colour for this.

, Use white thread so that the stitches will be less noticeable. You'll most likely want to match the face color of the ninja or use black thread.

, The possibilities are endless: use beads, buttons or embroider filled circles or even crosses if you'd rather have a knocked-out/fainted ninja. Use any colour you like or even different sized eyes for that home-made look.

Outline your frog design.,
Cut out the outlines of your stuffed frog.,
Decorate the front and back sides as you please.,
Pin and sew together your two body outlines together.,
Remove your pins and add accents.,
Stuff your toy frog.,
Tuck fabric inside the gap to reinforce the seam.,
Add finishing touches.",How to Make a Stuffed Animal1," You might choose a cartoonish image, or maybe you want to make something more true to form. In either case, take your washable fabric marker and draw the outline your animal onto the side opposite your fabric pattern for two separate pieces your fabric.


If you are less than confident in your drawing skills, you might look into how to draw a frog first, or you can get some inspiration by searching for the images of cute cartoon frogs online!
To make sewing easier, draw an outline of your desired doll size, measuring a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance around your outline.
One of your outlines will be used for the front, the other for the back.;
, Use your scissors to follow the outer line you have drawn to outline your stuffed animal. The inner line will be your seam guideline. This marks where you will sew the two pieces of your frog together.It may be easiest to cut two identical front/back pieces by folding your fabric in half, drawing your design in washable fabric marker, and then cutting both halves at the same time.
You can make cleaner and more distinct eyes by cutting each out separately from extra fabric you have. This way you can sew each onto the head at the seam allowance.
If you want to add a snout to the front, cut a small circle of fabric. Later, you can sew it in place and fill it with stuffing.

, You might want to design your frog off of a vibrantly colored tropical variety. You can do this by adding bright spots across its body with a washer safe fabric marker. Draw a cute face or some contour lines for the eyes and have fun with giving your stuffed frog character.


Use yarn or string to put a mouth, eyes and nose on. Buttons also work well as eyes, and are fairly easy to sew.
You may want to sew on plastic eyes or felt if you want more dimension., You'll want the guidelines you've drawn on your fabric facing each other. These will form the inside of your stuffed toy. The extra line you drew as a seam allowance should be visible on both sides after you pin. Use this as your sewing guide. Hand-stitch or use a machine to sew your outlines together, leaving a 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.6 cm) gap in your stitching.


The gap will be where you put the stuffing into your frog. The outer parts of your outline, like the flat section of a leg, are ideal places to leave a gap.
Sew your eyes along the top head part of the seam allowance, folding each down inside the animal while sewing to prevent interference with your seam stitch. When you turn your animal right-side-out so the pattern is returned to the outside, your eyes will look great!

, First you'll need to turn your frog right side out. Take the end opposite your stitching gap and feed it through the gap until the right sides are facing outwards. Now you can sew accents, such as your frog's snout if you've made one, to your fabric.


Simply sew your snout and/or other accents into place. You should leave a small gap in your stitching for stuffing.
Added on parts, like the snout, will be stuffed separately from the main body. It may be easiest for you to fill these with stuffing right away and sew the gap closed, though this can be done later as well.

, Take your stuffing and feed it through the gap you've left in your stitching. You'll want to pack it in until the doll holds its shape well, but you can adjust fullness to your liking until the animal is as firm as you want.

, Take one side of the fabric and push it through the gap in your stitching. Then sew the gap shut, being sure you stitch the tucked as well to make a strong seam.When sewing the gap shut, you may want to use a ladder stitch to make the seam look smoother., If you have extra fabric, you might use a thin strip to give your frog a scarf. With enough fabric, you could even sew a shirt or dress for your frog. Don't forget features like ear and nose holes! These can be made with dots of your washer safe fabric marker.

Give your homemade gift to a worthy recipient.",How to Make a Stuffed Animal2," Your cat head will certainly need pointy ears off to the sides. Also, a larger head shape might suit your purposes best. This way, you'll have more space to accommodate other features, like whiskers, a kitty-cat nose, and perhaps a w-shaped mouth. Draw two outlines with your washable fabric marker on the side opposite the pattern on separate pieces of fabric. One of these will be the front of your doll, the other for the back.


You might want to make your kitty-cat head adorably large. A 5 inch (12.7 cm) wide, 3 inch (7.62 cm) tall oval would be perfect for this!
To make sewing easier, draw an outline of your desired doll size, measuring a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance around your outline.
You can may want to draw ears on spare fabric and attach each separately. Each ear should have two pieces of fabric.

, Use your scissors to free the outlines from your length of fabric. Do so by following the outermost line, as the inner line is intended to be a guide for sewing your seam. Try to make your cuts around the ears especially clean - you probably don't want your kitty's ears to look ragged!At this point, you should also cut out any additional accents you've drawn on spare fabric. Each accent should be made of two pieces of fabric.
It may be easiest to cut two identical front/back pieces by folding your fabric in half, drawing your design in washable fabric marker, and then cutting both halves at the same time.

, Use pins to hold your outline together so that the seam lines face outward on the front and back pieces of fabric. This will make sewing easier for you, as you can follow your seam guideline. Once both halves of the body outline are in place, you should sew along your seam guideline to stitch both halves together, leaving a 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.6 cm) gap for stuffing.Pin your accents together in a similar fashion and sew both halves together. Leave a small gap in your stitching, stuff the accents piece (like ears) with filling, and finish the seam so no filling can escape.

, Carefully remove your pins from the fabric and place them in a safe receptacle, like a pincushion. Then feed your fabric through the gap you've left in the stitching so your guidelines and seam are on the inside of your doll.

, Simple accents include black button eyes, yarn whiskers, or embroidered eyelashes. You can even sew cute pink circles on the cheeks to give your kitty-cat a blush! If you've decided to make cat ears from a spare piece of fabric:


Mark ear placement lines with a washable fabric marker (optional).
Sew the base of your cat ears to the top of your cat head.

, Gently push your filling through the gap in the fabric until the shape begins to fill out. You can stuff it to the gills to give the finished doll a plusher appeal, or you might consider going light on stuffing so the doll isn't so stiff and can move during playtime.

, Stitch the final gap of your stuffed cat head closed. You can reinforce the stitch by tucking one side of the fabric in along the seam, including it in your stitch.Also, if you notice any features you've forgotten, you can make additions with a washer safe fabric marker. Dots on the cheeks are a quick fix for forgotten whiskers.

, You can take artistic liberties and make the design your own, but an effective stuffed cat doll can be made with a square or rectangular body. A 5-inch by 8-inch (12.7 by 20.3 cm) rectangle would work well for the body, and simple, rounded arms can be drawn whichever size you please.


Each part of the body should be drawn onto your fabric twice. Your body and limbs will need backs for each front - the two sides will require two pieces of same-sized fabric.
It may be easiest to cut two identical front/back pieces by folding your fabric in half, drawing your design in washable fabric marker, and then cutting both halves at the same time.
To make sewing easier, draw an outline of your desired doll size, measuring a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance around your outline.

, Take your scissors and clip free the body and limbs of your stuffed kitty-cat from the fabric. Follow your outer guideline the entire way around to free your outline from the fabric completely. By rounding the limbs of your kitty-cat, not only will it appear cute, but these regular shapes will be easier to sew., When sewing these pieces together, you'll want the seam guideline to be facing out on both front and back. Then you can pin these front and back pieces into place to make them more manageable. From there you should sew along your seam guideline and stitch both pieces together.Be sure you leave a sufficient gap, 2 to 3 inch (5 - 7.6 cm) should work well, for stuffing.

, Use care when taking your pins from the fabric so that you don't prick yourself, and be sure you put your pins in a safe container to prevent spills. The seam guidelines and the seam itself should be on the outside, you'll need to feed the fabric through the gap you left in the stitching.

, Push your filling gently through the gap in your stitching until each part is acceptably full to your preferences. Looser limbs can give your finished animal more flexibility, while a gill-stuffed doll will be more soft and plush.

, The final stitch is the one most likely to come undone, so you may want to close seams off by tucking one side of the fabric inward and sewing it along with your stitching.A ladder stitch can give a polished, professional look to the ending seam of your stuffed animal., You may want to mark the position of your limbs with your washable fabric marker before you get stitching. Then sew the body end of each limb to the body. Once the body is complete, sew the body and head together.

, Buttons on homemade stuffed toys are a cute embellishment. Your doll might look good with some flower buttons on the torso below the head. A cute and cheap skirt can be made by sewing a band of lace in a circle around your cat's ""hips.""

, Before you do, though, you may want to clip any loose threads or imprecise edges with your scissors. You can make clothes for your stuffed cat, draw a snazzy outfit on it with a washer safe marker, or even pin a ribbon atop its cute kitten head.

Prepare your cap on the ball/head.,
Cut your yarn in generous lengths.,
Make a small, thick line of glue on the base of the head.,
Apply the yarn pieces side-by-side until the entire wig is covered completely.",How to Make a Ragdoll Wig1," You'll need a swim cap, pantyhose, or some sort of hat that will cover around your hairline. If you have a manikin head, great! Throw it on there. Otherwise, you may have to trust your eyeballing skills.;
, This is ultimately up to you. The longer the hair you want, the longer your pieces of yarn should be.


Raggedy Andy has hair somewhere between 6 and 10 inches (15 and 25 cm) long.
After your yarn is cut, take one piece of yarn, tie a knot on both ends, and set it aside. This will be your control, or a length example. If you run out of yarn, you'll be able to cut more with this piece, matching the length.

, If you're making a split-colored wig, only draw a line over half of the base. It's best to start from the bottom, but you can really start anywhere. The mobility of the base allows you to hold it from all positions.

, If you started on top, flip the yarn to other side of head or tie up to see the under layers better.


If you want your wig to be a thick, full set of hair, your pieces and lines will need to be very close together. If you're less concerned, draw glue lines with about an inch or two (2.5 - 5 cm) apart and place your pieces of yarn as you see fit.
Style the yarn once dried!

"
"
Cut your yarn to the desired length.,
Find the center.,
Sew on a comb.,
Adjust and cut to your liking.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Ragdoll Wig2," With this example, the center of the yarn is going on the center of the head -- so double whatever length you want from the top of the hairline to the tip of the yarn.


Arrange them in an orderly pile. You should be able to pick them up with one hand, like a bunch of noodles. But make sure the ends all line up!

, Line up a felt strip as backing through the very middle of the strands and being sewing sections with a back stitch. This will end up being your center part.


Continue sewing until the entire felt strip is sewn onto the strands of yarn. Once you're done, flip it over.

, This will keep the wig in place when it is being worn. Sew it on the end where you began with the felt strip. The teeth of the comb should be facing toward the yarn, not away. Place it directly on top of the felt (when held upside-down), so the comb won't be seen through the yarn.


The comb should be only 3 or 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) wide. It should not be wider than the felt strip. Use one of the comb-like hair accessories that can be purchased in most big box or drug stores.

, You may have some pieces that have magically gotten longer or shorter; trim and style your wig until it meets your expectations.


An easy way to style the wig is to tie each side with a ribbon about halfway down the length of the hair. It keeps it from getting tangled and getting in the wearer's eyes -- and it's cute!

Use cotton for softness and washability.,
Consider fake fur for teddy bears and toy animals that would appear more realistic with this fabric.,
Choose felt for ease of use.,
Consider towelling for baby toys.,
Use velvet for clothing.",How to Choose Fabric for Soft Toy Making," Cotton is a very versatile fabric that comes in a wide range of colours and patterns. It is easily washable, which is great for keeping toys clean and its softness and non-scratchy texture make it pleasant to handle. In terms of the weight of cotton, consider using:


Lightweight cotton for doll clothing and small nursery and stroller toys
Heavyweight cotton for large toys and dolls
Cotton yarn for knitted or crocheted toys is excellent too;
, It can be less easy to sew and care needs to be taken if the backing is knitted as this can stretch out of shape with handling. It is also more expensive than simple fabrics like cotton.

, Felt is a very common fabric for home sewn toys. It is easy to work with and is soft to touch. It moulds easily, stretches to fit shapes that you want and as it has no grain or nap, there is no problem matching pieces or having the nap ride up the wrong way. Felt does not fray either, which makes it an enduring fabric. The only disadvantage is that it is not washable but spot stains can be treated with a damp cloth to lightly sponge the area.

, It is soft and very washable. Toys made from towelling can even be taken into the bath and dried again.

, Velvet might be a wonderful fabric for toys of old but it is very difficult to work with to create a whole soft toy from - it is easy to get the nap going the wrong way and the fabric frays easily, making it very hard to work with and to piece together. It doesn't wash easily either. However, it can make great clothes such as dresses or jackets, especially for dolls or toys that will be more on display rather than played with. Definitely for the experienced sewer.

Topstitch the hem down, leaving a small gap.,
Pin the loop to the circle with the right sides facing in.,
Sew around the circle.,
Thread some elastic through the loop's hem.,
Sew the ends of the elastic together.,
Turn the cover inside out.",How to Make a Fabric Frisbee2," Place a Frisbee down on a piece of colorful cotton fabric. Use a dressmaker's chalk or pen to trace around the Frisbee, ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) from the edge., Measure around the Frisbee and add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) for seam allowance. Draw a rectangle on the fabric that is 3½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide and whatever the Frisbee's circumference is (plus the seam allowance).You can draw the rectangle on the same piece of fabric, or use a different color/pattern.

, The circle will make the top of the Frisbee and the rectangle will make the inside hem., Fold the narrow ends of the rectangle together, right sides together. Sew along the edge using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance., This will make it easier to insert the elastic later on. If you'd like to, you can topstitch both of the hems down close to the seam. This will add an element of design and keep the hems from fraying., Working your way around the loop, fold one of the raw edges in by ¼-inch (0.32-centimeter). Press it flat with an iron as you go. When you are done, fold the edge in by ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) and press it with an iron once more. Make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the fabric., Try to sew as close to the inside, folded edge as you can so that you'll have room for the elastic. Leave a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) gap between the start and end of your sewing so that you can insert the elastic.

You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.

, Turn the circle so that the right side is facing you. Make sure that the wrong side of the loop is facing out, then pin the remaining raw edge all the way around the circle., Use a ¼-inch (0.32-centimeter) seam allowance and a matching thread color. When you are done sewing, consider cutting notches into the seam. This will make the cover lay more smoothly after you turn it inside out., Frisbee, then cut some ⅜-inch (0.95-centimeter) wide elastic according to that length. Use a safety pin to thread the elastic through the opening in the hem. Remove the safety pin when you are done., Overlap the ends until the loop rests neatly against the circle. Sew the ends together using a straight stitch. Trim off any excess elastic, if necessary.

Don't make the elastic too tight. You want to be able to stretch the cover over your Frisbee.
Don't make the elastic too loose, or the cover will fall off.
Give your Frisbee a nicer finish by tucking the elastic into the hem, then stitch the 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) gap shut.

, At this point, your cover is complete, and ready to be slipped over a Frisbee. If you want to, press both sides of the cover with an iron first, before slipping it over a Frisbee."

",How to Make a Narwhal from a Sock," Draw a teardrop shape and another teardrop that's slightly larger. Then sketch a large triangle.


Since these will only be used for tracing, you do not need to use cardstock or cardboard. You may use any paper you like.;
, Choose a bright and colorful sock to use. Patterned socks also work. You may stuff it with stuffing, beads, dried rice, beans, or anything small and round, such as pebbles.

, Wait until it's completely dried. Be careful not to burn yourself.

, Once the glue has dried, cut the edges off. Try a more curvy approach so it resembles more of a narwhal's tail.


You may skip this step, but your smaller teardrop template will have to be large enough to cover half the sock at its widest point.

, Turn the sock upside down and shake it to make sure the stuffing will not come out. If your beads or stuffing falls out, it is either not sealed or has too much stuffing.

, Make two of each tear drop and a single large triangle. Try to make the teardrops match.


Use the white fabric on the triangle.

, Simply roll it up and pinch the bottom to keep it from unraveling. You may twist for a spiral effect, or wrap black thread around it.

, This prevents from unraveling. Make sure the hot glue does not drip on you or spread.


Trim your horn until it reaches your desired shape. Make sure the bottom is flat so it is easier to glue on later.

, Make sure the points are facing outwards. You can use larger fabrics if you like a larger tail, but be sure they are identical.

, Place hot glue on the tear drop, and then place some on your sock. This prevents it from making a mess. Be careful not to have them uneven!

, Make sure the bottom is flat before you glue it. Otherwise, it might come off. If it does come off, your horn may not be sturdy enough.

, You can use black fabric circles or googly eyes in its place. Add additional accessories such as spots if desired.

Consider the age of the child who will play with the toys when adding eyes.,
Use good, strong thread if you are attaching eyes.,
Position eyes carefully.,
Make a contoured eye socket prior to stitching on the eye.",How to Add Eyes to Soft Toys," If you are making an animal, the eyes should be representative of the animal. More human-like eyes are suitable for dolls. Some eyes will change the mood, look, or character of the toy, so it is a good idea to hold up different sets of eyes to see what overall look is created.;
, There are lots of possibilities for making eyes for soft toys. Some ideas include:


Embroidering eyes
Sewing on beads or buttons
Making raised eyes out of the same fabric as the toy, with felt additions
Safety lock eyes
Googly eyes (glued on firmly, not suitable for under 5's)
Marker or fabric paint drawn eyes (but be careful or this can look kitsch)

, Embroidered or marker made eyes tend to be the safest as there is nothing to pull off and swallow.

, To prevent eyes from coming off, use strong thread such as waxed buttonhole thread or dental floss. Be sure to stitch on tightly and firmly.

, They should look as realistic as possible and should be spaced as they would be on a real human or animal, or at least give a sense of perspective to a human viewer. Consider the possibilities of how eyes come across through positioning; for example, eyes that are large and wide apart have an innocent and naive look, whereas eyes positioned closely together can look stern and mean. Play around a bit before settling on the final positioning.

, This will make it appear more realistic and appealing. It also helps to define the whole facial features.

",How to Finish Seams on Soft Toys," Prefer lighter thread if you cannot match exactly. Once stuffed, the seam thread will show.;
, This is especially important for toys that will be played with and moved about a lot.

, Double stitch tight corners and pressure points to avoid accidental loosening or fraying from occurring. There is nothing worse than the stuffing popping out unexpectedly!

, Alternatively, tie off the ends of the thread for each seam end very tightly. The aim is to ensure that the seams will not unravel.

Obtain about a quarter yard (22.8cm) of closely woven fabric.,

Cut 36 football shapes (American football, not soccer!),

With ""right sides"", or patterned side, of the fabric together, stitch two pieces together along one edge.,

Important: Make all of the football shapes exactly the same size, and allow an extra 1/4 inch (1/2 cm) for the seams.
12 shapes from each of three different colors works very nicely for this project.

, If sewing by hand, take care to make your stitches very small and even to prevent problems later.

Note: Begin and end the seam a seam allowance width from the point to prevent bunching when sewing and turning.

,, With right sides facing, sew one long edge together., This will create a three sided wedge which resembles a (somewhat fat) orange section.

If using three fabrics, use one fabric per side of your wedges so that you can ""change colors"" on the ball later.

, Bear in mind that you may need to adjust quantities of fabric, stuffing and foam for larger cubes. The quantities given in this article are enough to create an 8 inch (20cm) plush cube.

Print off at least six copies of the pattern.

,,,, These will be the first things sewn.,, Make two parallel lines of stitching approximately 1/4 inch (6 mm) from each other on each pink strip. Trim the excess fabric away to leave only the narrow pink lines.
,, Take care to line up the pink lines from the pattern with the underlying pink lines you sewed onto the bottom, dark grey, layer.

, Take care to line up the sewn pink lines with the pattern.

, Back stitch each section as you sew it, to prevent the seam unraveling. Lift the needle and pressure foot between each section. (Don't stitch any extra or connecting lines between sections.)
, The paper should tear away from the fabric along the seam lines fairly easily, since the needle holes create a perforated line as you sew. Remove all the pattern paper.

, Pin it in place and top stitch it carefully to the center.

,, (Center ""O"" and the lines going out from it to the edge.)

,,, You will place the squares ""facing together"" or ""right sides"" together for sewing, so marking on the ""back"" or ""wrong"" side will give you a line to sew along and help you keep your cube sides absolutely square and perfect. A straight edge and a 90 degree angle are helpful. You can also use a paper pattern piece cut along the seam lines as a guide.

, Take special care to line up and pin the edges of the light grey sections. If they are sewn askew, it is very noticeable in the finished product. It can be quite difficult to unpick the seams to fix later., Back stitch all seams to prevent raveling. Leave one side unsewn for stuffing. It is best to sew the four sides and top together first and stuff from the bottom so that the hand sewn closing seam is less visible in the finished product. Trim the seams carefully to make it easier to turn them right side out.

,, Notice that you cannot simply cut six equal pieces. You must cut two squares and 4 rectangles to cover the cube neatly. In the case of an 8 inch (20cm) cube, assuming that your foam is one inch (2 cm) thick, the cube's sides would be: four 8""x7"" (20cm x 17.5cm) rectangles and two 6"" (15cm) squares.


Measure twice and be certain of your measurements before you cut the foam to prevent frustration later. The foam sheets are not ""strictly"" necessary, but they prevent your cube from taking on a very rounded look when stuffed later on.
Adjust your measurements if you are using a thicker foam sheet or a foam cube as a base.

, Depending on the foam used, you may need to glue or sew the foam pieces together along their edges before stuffing to prevent shape deformation.,, Enjoy!

Repair any damaged stitching.",How to Repair a Zipper when the Slider Has Come Off Completely," You will need to vary your approach to repairing your zipper depending on whether it is split (open-ended) or closed.Split zippers are the type typically found on jackets and coats—i.e. zippers that separate completely at both ends when fully unzipped.
Closed zippers may be closed at both ends (e.g. in tents and many types of bags) or at one end (e.g. the zipper on the fly of your jeans). The two ends are never fully separated, and the bottom of the zipper may be stopped by a prong stop or with a few stitches.;
, Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the width of the teeth while the zipper is closed. This will help you select a repair kit of the right size. Zipper size is determined by the width of the zipper in millimeters. For example, a #5 zipper is 5mm wide across the teeth., You will need a zipper slider repair kit of the correct size, along with pliers, cutting pliers, a seam ripper, and a needle and thread. You may also need tweezers or a pin to help you thread the new slider onto your zipper., To repair a split or open-ended zipper, you will be putting your new slider on from the top. Identify the side that the slider was originally attached to (i.e. the side where the bottom stop is attached)., Once you have determined which side the slider was attached to, use cutting pliers to remove the top stop on that side.Take care not to damage the fabric when you snip off the zipper stop.
Once you have removed the stop, or if the stop is already missing (which may be the reason your slider came off in the first place), use tweezers to remove any loose threads in the area.

, Slide the slider on from the top of the side where you just removed the zipper stop. Make sure that the zipper pull is facing out (toward you) and that the flat end of the slider is facing down. Test the slider to make sure it is working correctly by zipping up your zipper from the bottom as you normally would., Put your new top stop in the same position as the one you removed, and crimp it onto the zipper fabric with a pair of pliers., To repair a closed-ended or closed loop zipper, you will need to replace the slider from the bottom. The bottoms of most closed zippers are encased in fabric. Use a seam ripper to open the stitches around the bottom of the zipper to give yourself easy access., A closed zipper may be stopped with a prong stop (usually the case with zippers on jeans and some purses or bags) or just a few stitches at the bottom of the zipper.

If your zipper ends in a prong stop, use pliers to pull it off.If your zipper is stopped with stitches, use a seam ripper to remove them. Take care not to damage the fabric at the bottom of the zipper., Make sure the slider is facing the right way up (i.e. with the flat end facing the bottom of the zipper). Guide the bottom zipper teeth into the compartments on each side of the slider.

If you are repairing a zipper on a pair of pants, it may be easiest to do this with the zipper flipped inside out, so that the back of the slider is facing you as you work.You may need to use a pin or tweezers to help you guide the teeth into the slider., Hold the ends of the zipper with one hand to create equal tension on both sides, and slowly pull up the zipper with the other hand. Make sure that the teeth lock correctly. Don’t pull the slider up so far that it comes off the top of the zipper again., Once you have zipped up your zipper most of the way, it is time to repair the stop you removed from the bottom of the zipper.

If your zipper originally had a prong stop at the bottom, replace it with a new one. Push the prongs through the fabric in the same place where the original stop was positioned, making sure not to leave a gap between the top of the stop and the bottom teeth of the zipper. Crimp down the prongs at the back of the zipper with pliers.If your zipper was stopped with stitches, re-stitch them with a needle and thread., If your zipper is open on one end (e.g. like the fly on a pair of jeans) and the slider came off, there is a good chance that you lost the slider because the top stops were broken or damaged. If necessary, remove any damaged top stops with cutting pliers. Crimp new top stops on with pliers, making sure to position them directly above the top teeth of the zipper., If you ripped out any of the stitches around the bottom or top of your zipper, you will need to repair them with a needle and thread."

",How to Keep a Loose Button in Place with Clear Nail Polish," For buttons that have already fallen from the thread or truly dangling in place, you will most likely just need to sew it back in place. However, for a button that appears to be wiggling or loose, this method should be sufficient.;
, Be very careful to not rip the button from the thread but be sure you secure it in place first. If you are unsure whether buttoning the shirt will result in the thread’s demise, attempt the nail polish method before buttoning it in place but allow time to dry and take care when buttoning the shirt.

;
, Draw a circle at the end of the sock, using the curve of the toe as a base. Add ear at the top of the circle to make the outline of a bear's head. This should not take up more than a quarter of the length of the sock. Cut the fabric just above the line of the ears. Once it is cut out, cut off just a sliver of fabric at the very base of the circle to make a hole for the neck.








, Just above the heel, you'll see the tube of fabric that goes up the leg. Starting right after the curve of the heel ends and going until the hem of the sock, visually divide that length in half. Cut at that middle point on the long part of the sock. The end bit will be divided in two to make the arms. Cut a short split down the middle of the larger piece, until you reach the beginning of the heel. This will form the body and the legs.








, Flip the head inside out and then use a sewing machine or your hands to sew the top of the head closed. Once it's closed, flip it right side out and then stuff the head with filling. Sew the neck closed when you've reached the desired head size.

, Draw a profile (side-view) of the head that you want for your bear. Cut out two pieces in this shape. Next, stitch them together from the neck up to the nose.








, Cut the gusset, or middle piece, to go between the two head pieces you already cut and sewed. Draw out a shape like a men's tie and make it long enough to reach between the point of the nose, all the way around to the back of the neck. You will need to line it up at the neck and pin it in place before sewing.








, Once you've drawn and cut out the shape, sew the gusset into place between the existing head pieces.








, Now you'll need to make the body pieces. Start with two pieces of fabric cut into rectangles. Now, make rounded cutouts at each of the corners. Sew the sides together, along the long edges, so that you end up with a sort of tube. Now, sew one of the short edges closed, leaving the circle cutouts open. The arms and legs will be joined to the body at the circles.

Gather your materials.,
Add button attachment or tape.,
Set stitch type to zigzag and stitch width to zero.,
Check the stitch width.,
Drop “feed dogs.” The teeth on the plate of your sewing machine are also known as the “feed dogs.” These teeth help to move your fabric along as you sew.,
Check the position of your button on the garment.,
Begin stitching slowly.,
Cut excess thread.,
Sew on additional buttons or sew through extra holes.",How to Machine Sew on a Button," Using your sewing machine to sew on buttons is easy, but you will need some special materials and tools to get started. To sew buttons onto a piece of clothing, you will need to have:buttons
garment you want to sew buttons onto
sewing machine
button attachment or some tape;
, If you have a button attachment, then you can slide that piece onto your sewing machine foot. Depending on the design of your sewing machine, you may need to remove the foot before you can use the button attachment. Check your machine user guide to be sure.








If you do not have a button attachment, then you can just hold the button in place on your garment using a bit of tape or by pressing the button down with the ankle of the machine.To use tape, place the button on your garment wherever you want it to go. Then, apply two pieces of tape along the edges of the button. The tape should hold your button in place as you sew.

, Once your button is in place, you will need to check the position of your needle. But before you do this, make sure that your stitch type is set to zigzag and the stitch width is set to zero.








Setting your machine to the zigzag stitch is important because the needle has to go back and forth through he button holes.
You will likely need to adjust the width before you can begin sewing the button, so do not begin sewing yet.

, After you have your machine on the proper settings, use the hand crank on your machine to slowly move the needle down towards your garment. However, do not push the needle down all the way. Just look to see where the needle would come down if you turned the crank all the way. Then, use this position to help you adjust your stitch width.








Increase the stitch width a little at a time until the needle is coming down right over the button holes on both sides of the button. When the position looks correct, then you will be ready to sew.
Keep in mind that if you have an advanced machine with a button setting, then checking the stitch width may not be necessary, but it is still a good idea., Since you do not want the fabric to move while you sew on a button, it is best to drop the teeth before you start sewing.With some sewing machines, the teeth will drop automatically when you select the button function. However, if your machine does not have a button function or if the teeth do not go down when you select the button function, then you will need to lower them manually. Check your user guide for instructions on how to do this.

, Before you start sewing, make sure that your button is exactly where you want it to be on the garment. Double check the position to be sure. You may even want to place a couple of pieces of clear tape on either side of the button to ensure that it will not move from this position.You can also use a water soluble marker or some tailor’s chalk to mark where you want your button to go. Just position your button and then draw four dots around the edges of your button. You can refer to these dots as you sew the button in place.If you are sewing on multiple buttons, then you may want to position all of them at once. You can use a ruler to ensure that they are in a straight line.

, It is important to go slowly when sewing on a button with a sewing machine, or your needle may come down onto the button instead of going through the button hole. If this happens, then your needle is likely to break. Apply gentle pressure to the foot pedal of your machine.








You can also turn the wheel on your sewing machine to stitch by hand if you are worried about breaking your needle.
Make sure that you stitch through the holes in the button several times. Go in and out of the holes and garment cloth several times to ensure that the button is securely attached. The button may seem a bit tight when you are done, but it will loosen up over time.

, After you have sewn on the button, you will need to cut the excess thread from your button. There will be a piece in the front of the button and in the back of the garment cloth. Use the loop in the back of the garment cloth to pull the front piece through to the back.








Trim both pieces of thread so that you only have about four inches of thread extending from the button. You may also want to tie a knot in the end of the thread for security.If you have gone through the button several times with thread, then it should stay in place for a long time, but it will loosen up eventually and a knot may prevent the button from falling straight off.
If the thread will not easily pull through to the other side, then you can also thread it through a needle and then insert the needle through the fabric underneath the button. Then, pull the thread through to the other side of the fabric.

, After you have completed this first button, you can repeat the process with any other buttons that you need to sew onto your garment. If the button that you are sewing on has four holes, then you will need to rotate the fabric and repeat the process on the other two holes.








You should be able to use the same settings, but always check by hand cranking the wheel first.

Lubricate the zipper with graphite.,
Apply laundry soap.,
Wash the item and lubricate it.",How to Fix a Broken Zipper1," When your zipper just won’t budge, applying a lubricant can get it moving. Try rubbing graphite on your zipper’s teeth to lubricate them.









Purchase a graphite stick used specifically for lubrication. If you don’t have one, use a Number 2 pencil.
Run the pencil up and down the zipper’s teeth. If you want, you can just apply it to the area of the teeth where the zipper is stuck.
Wiggle the slider up and down until it moves smoothly along the teeth.;
, When graphite doesn’t work, apply a dab of laundry soap to your stuck zipper. The soap may add an extra level of lubrication that will help you get the zipper unstuck. To use laundry soap as lubrication:









Pour a small amount of detergent into a small dish.
Pour a small amount of water into the same dish.
Dip a cotton ball or swab into the mixture.
Use the saturated cotton ball to coat the teeth in the solution.
Place the cotton ball down and gently attempt to unzip the zipper. It may only move a little. If this is the case, return the slider to its original position. Repeat until the zipper is unstuck., If graphite or laundry detergent don’t work, you may want to launder the item and try again. Ultimately, washing the item may help remove dirt, grime, and other objects that hinder your ability to close the zipper. After you wash it, apply more lubricant.


Consider washing the item by itself. This way, loose threads, fuzz, or debris from other items won't get stuck in the zipper."

Gather your materials.,
Iron on the patch.,
Insert the button pieces into the tool.,
Line up the button.,
Hammer the button into place.",How to Replace a Jean Button1," Jean buttons are usually made of metal and they attach to the jeans with a stud. Therefore, you may be able to replace a jeans button without any sewing. To do this, you will need:Replacement button
Button tool
Iron-on denim patch
Hammer;
, A patch will help to reinforce the area where you will place your new button. Cut the patch as needed to ensure that it will fit into the space behind the button. Then, iron on the patch according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

If you can’t find an iron on denim patch, or do not wish to purchase one, then you can also get a piece of scrap denim and glue or sew it onto the area behind where you will place the new button.

, Jean buttons come in two pieces. One piece is the button and the other is a backing piece with a stud that connects with the button. Put the two pieces into the button replacement tool.The button will go into the larger slot and the backing will go into the smaller slot.

, Next, close the button tool partially and slide it over the jeans. The button side should be on the outer part of the jeans and the stud piece should be on the inside.Try to align the pieces so that they will be near the location of the old button, but so that the stud will go through the denim and the patch.

, After you have positioned the tool, close it as much as you can. Then, get the hammer and hit the tool to snap the two pieces together.Just give the button replacement tool a gentle tap with the hammer at first and then increase the force if necessary.
After the pieces are secured together, you can remove the tool. The new button should be secured and the jeans should be ready to wear!

Remove buildup from a zipper’s teeth.,
Straighten bent teeth.,
Resecure the zipper and the teeth.",How to Fix a Broken Zipper2," When substances build up around the teeth of your zipper, it can prevent the zipper from staying closed. As a result, you’ll need to clean the teeth and remove stuff that could be preventing the zipper from closing.









Combine water and soap in a small dish, and stir until suds form.
Dip a clean rag in the soapy water and wipe down the zipper’s teeth.
Grab a fresh rag and run it under the tap.
Wipe the soapy mixture off the teeth with the damp rag.
Attempt to zip and unzip as normal., If all else fails, you may need to fix bent teeth to get your zipper to close. To do this, use your tool of choice (perhaps pliers) to pull the tooth straight.









Repeat as needed.
Be careful not to pull the tooth out of the tape.
Test the repair by opening and closing the zipper as normal., Move the slider towards the bottom of the zipper without pulling it off. Straighten and align the zipper’s teeth with your fingers. Slowly feed the zipper into the slider. You may need to apply a little force. Make sure the side of the zipper moves down all the way into the bottom stopper.









You may need to repeat this several times."
"
Remove the top zipper stops.,
Slide the slider off the teeth from the top and examine it.,
Replace the slider.,
Check to see if the slider works.,
Replace the top zipper stops.",How to Fix a Broken Zipper3," You'll probably have to use a lot of force to remove the zipper stops. If you use pliers to gain more leverage, be careful that you don’t clamp down too hard and further damage the zipper. This is important, as you won’t be able to fully access the teeth of the zipper or examine the slider without removing the stops.







, Examine the slider from the side. Look to see if the space between the bottom and top of the slider are uneven. An uneven gap may prevent the slider from properly engaging the teeth.









If the slider is bent or there is a gap, take a pair of pliers and try to straighten it out.
If you can’t fix the slider, you will have to replace it. The size should be listed on the back. If the size is not listed, measure the slider. Zipper parts are measured in millimeters. A 5-mm slider is a size 5. Purchase a replacement slider at your local fabric store or online., After you’ve fixed or replaced the slider, you need to put it back on the teeth of the zipper. When replacing the slider, make sure to:









Locate the side of the zipper that has the square tab on the bottom.
Wedge the top teeth of the zipper into the slider.
If necessary, use a flathead screwdriver to wedge the teeth into the gap.
Wiggle and pull the slider until it moves down to the bottom of the zipper., Try zipping the item as normal to see if it has a complete range up and down the teeth track. There are a number issues that could continue to cause problems for you:









If the zipper continues to split and you replaced the slider, you may have purchased the incorrect size. Try a different size slider.
If you bent the original slider, the gap may still be uneven. Remove the slider and bend it again. Repeat until the item zips properly., Once you’ve replaced the slider, you’ll have to replace the top zipper stops above the top set of teeth. Without securing the stops, your slider will fall off or won’t function correctly.









Use a pair of pliers to clench the stop into place.
Press down on the stop 4 to 5 times to secure it.
Repeat on the other side of the zipper.
If you are only replacing 1 top zipper stop, make sure you place it on the side of the zipper with the tab at the bottom."
"
Take off the bottom stop.,
Remove the tack at the base of the zipper.,
Attach a larger bottom stop.,
Re-tack the placket layers.",How to Fix a Broken Zipper4," The bottom stop is the piece that the slider will rest against when it travels all the way down the teeth to the bottom of the zipper. To deal with missing bottom teeth, you’ll have to remove the old bottom stop.









Hold the garment firmly and pull the stops off.
In some cases, you may need pliers to help you gain more leverage pulling the stop off., The tack is a piece that keeps the parts of the zipper secure to the garment. By removing the tack, you’ll be able to fully access the teeth. This is important, as you’ll need to fix all your zipper’s teeth before your zipper will work correctly.









Flip the garment inside out and locate the tack at the bottom of the placket layers of the item (this will be on the inside flap covering the zipper).
Remove the tack with a seam ripper., By inserting a new and larger bottom stop, you’ll be able to cover missing teeth. Thus, your zipper will function normally and won’t get stuck or snagged in the future.









Bottom zipper stops are measured in millimeters. Determine the size you will need by measuring the width of the closed zipper.
Turn the garment right side out.
Push the prongs of the bottom zipper stop into the fabric directly above the old zipper stop—the new zipper stop will cover the missing bottom teeth.
Turn the garment inside out and check if the stop is perpendicular to the zipper.
Close the prongs with a pair of pliers to secure it in place., Once you’ve attached a new stop, you’ll need to re-tack the bottom portion of the zipper so it holds together with the garment. This is somewhat easy to do.









Turn your garment right side out.
Use a sewing machine or a needle and thread to replace the tack you removed."
"
Replace a broken pull with a new pull or a paperclip.,
Use a key ring to secure a slipping pants zipper.,
Manually close the zipper.",How to Fix a Broken Zipper5," Open the small metal ring attached to your new pull with the round tip pliers and hook the open metal ring onto the end of the slider. Use round tip pliers to close the metal ring and secure the new pull in place.









If you’re on the road and don’t have a new pull or pliers, use a paperclip as a temporary pull. Simply slip the paperclip into the old pull or the slider itself., Slipping pants zippers are one of the most frustrating types of zipper problems. To create a temporary fix, attach a keyring onto the end of your zipper pull. Zip up the garment and hook the key ring around the button of your pants.







, If the zipper doesn't function correctly, you may be able to close it temporary by forcing both sides of the teeth together. To create a temporary fix, start at the bottom and move your way up until the zipper is closed.









If you have buttons to secure your garment, fasten them to help keep the zipper closed.

Gather your materials.,
Thread a needle.,
Position the denim patch.,
Sew the button into place.",How to Replace a Jean Button2," Sewing a button on in place of a missing button is another easy way to replace a missing jeans button. To sew on a button, you will need:

Replacement button
Needle
Thread (use a heavy duty or denim thread)
Scissors
Small denim patch (optional)

, Insert the thread through the needle’s eye. Pull the thread through the eye so that about 18 inches of thread is hanging from the eye. Then, snip the thread to make the pieces even.You can buy pre-threaded needles if you don’t want to bother with threading a needle.

, If your jeans are still intact where the old button was located, then you may not need to use a denim patch. However, if there is a gap, then adding a patch can help to stabilize the new thread.

The patch does not need to be very big. Just large enough to cover the area behind where the button will go.
You may iron on the patch if it has adhesive on the back, but this is not necessary. The thread will hold the patch in place.

, Insert the thread through the back of the jeans where you have positioned the denim patch. Sew through the patch and the jeans a few times to secure the thread. Then, insert the needle through the button on the front side of the jeans. Next, push the needle back through the denim and patch.

Continue to insert the needle through the button and back through the jeans several times until the button is secure. Then, snip the excess thread and tie it in a knot to help keep it secure.

",How to Make a Dinosaur Tail," By pre-cutting the fabric, it will allow you to assemble the tail a little quicker than measuring, cutting and sewing all at once.


Cut the main fabric area: tail--cut 2 sections that are 22″ x 11″. Waist strap: Four pieces of 12″ x 3″. Circle cut 7” in diameter. Spikes cut two 22 x 3.5”.;
, Measure 4.5” from the left top corner and bottom left corner of the fabric and 4” from the top of the right top corner of the fabric.


Mark and cut.
Mark and cut the same measurements on the other piece of tail fabric.

, Draw spikes using your fabric pencil, on the inside of the fabric. Leave approximately ½” between each spike and use the entire fabric size to create the spikes.


Sew spikes, inside out.






Cut along spike seam line, leaving approximately ¼” allowance for the entire strip.






Snip the top of each spike and the corners of the spike triangles. Be careful not to snip through the sewn areas to avoid creating a hole.






Turn spikes right-side out and poke spike tips outward using the end of the pen.







, First pin the spikes to one piece of the tail with the biggest spike on the wider end of the tail.


Sew the spikes to the first piece of the tail with 1/4"" seam allowance.







, Put the two identical pieces of tail fabric together, but inside out.


Sew tail leaving 1/2” seam allowance. Leave a space (about 4 to 5 inches) below the spike for the stuffing that will be added inside the tail later.

, Put two straps together (inside out) and sew 3 sides (leaving the bottom side unsewn).


Trim corners.






Turn strips right side out and then add top stitching along the edges.






Sew Velcro pieces on the ends of the waist straps.






Pin waist straps inside the tail. Make sure Velcro pieces match up so they will attach when worn. Sew straps to tail.







,, Add polyfil stuffing and then replace with circle to close tail. Stitch around the sides to secure in place.

Keep in mind the need for regular stitching when sewing blanket stitch.,

,
Connect your last stitch to your first stitch by sliding your needle sideways underneath your first stitch.,
Poke the needle through the top of the first stitch you made and knot it at the back.,
Cut off the extra thread.,
Add variety if you choose.",How to Sew Blanket Stitch," The blanket stitch is as much decoration as it is functional. Regular stitching with the same space between each one will make your finished product look nice and even.


You can also alter the vertical stitches for a unique look if you choose. For example, you could have one stitch closer to the edge and the next farther from the edge, then closer again and so on.;
, Because the blanket stitch is decorative it is better to choose a slightly thicker thread. This way it will stand out against your fabric. It should be whichever color you prefer to go along with your fabric.

, Push the thread through the head of the needle to thread it. Leave one end long and the other shorter, about 6- 12 inches (15-30 cm). With kids, it might be better to do a double thread and tie both ends together at the long end. This way they do not get frustrated if the thread comes out of the needle.







, This will either be left to right or right to left. Many prefer left to right although either direction will work fine.








, Use your left thumb to hold down the thread so it does not pull through the needle (if you have knotted both ends of the thread together then this is not necessary). Starting back to front will leave your knot on the back side where it won’t be seen easily.









If you are sewing one layer then the knot should be on the back side of your fabric.
If you are sewing two layers then the knot should be between the two fabrics where it will not be seen. Once you have finished sewing the knot will be inside and the stitches will thus look neater.
If you are sewing in from the edge (two pieces of fabric with one on top smaller than the other) then this first stitch should come out along the bottom edge of the fabric on top., Your first and last stitches should always be two jumps in the same spot. This way the first and last stitches are vertical like the others rather than on a diagonal.








, If you are sewing left to right then your needle should be pushed through to the right along the edge of the fabric. The opposite is true if you are sewing right to left. This anchors your thread but is not a true stitch.








, The thread will come out directly below on the lower line.








, The loop should be underneath with your thread coming out over the top of it. You have just completed your first true blanket stitch! Proceed with the next stitch by moving to the right and inserting the needle at the upper end of the line once more .








, You could stitch down through the same hole as the previous one or simply make a hole on the diagonal.








, After poking the needle down, draw it through the loop as you would when stitching along the edge. You will now have completed your corner stitch!








, This following stitch can either be in the same hole as the corner stitch and the last one on the preceding edge, or it can be a new hole. It is personal preference as to which option you choose.








,









If you are sewing a single layer along the edge or sewing in from the edge then simply let the thread come out the back of the fabric.
If you are sewing two layers along the edge then only push the needle through the upper layer, allowing the excess thread to come out between the layers.

, This should not be so loose that there will be extra thread nor so tight that your next stitch will not be able to catch the loop as in the basic blanket stitch. You can pull the thread to the side where it would be pulled flat at the end of the stitch to determine how loose you must leave it.

, You will want to tie this knot right at the edge of the fabric (either on the back side or in between the two layers) so that the thread cannot become too loose.








, You can choose a different color for this next thread to add variety or use the same color thread. Tie a knot in the end of the thread, either in the longer end of the thread or tying both threads together at the end.








, This will begin the stitches with your added thread.









If you are sewing one layer along the edge then you should tie the new thread onto the knot at the end of the old thread, attaching the two together.
If you are sewing two layers along the edge then your new thread should start in between the two layers and come out through the back of the fabric.
If you are sewing in from the edge then your new thread should start the same as when you began your first stitch, from back to front along the bottom edge of the fabric., Sliding your needle under the loose loop will make it seem as though the stitching has not been interrupted. It is as though you are completing the second part of the basic blanket stitch (pulling the thread through the loop) with your new thread.








, After pulling the thread tight you will push the needle down along the upper line and pull it through the loop as in the basic blanket stitch.








,, This completes the edging of all your stitches.









If you are sewing in from the edge you will not have a stitch to slide under. You can simply poke your needle down through the back on the right side of your last stitch. Then knot the thread at the back of the fabric.

, This should result in two threads along the same line and complete your blanket stitch.









If you are sewing two layers along the edge then do not poke your needle through at the top of the first stitch. Rather loop your thread underneath your first stitch once again and before pulling it tight send your needle through the loop to make a knot. Then pull it tight.

, Cut off any remaining thread to make your stitches look tidy.









If you are sewing two layers along the edge then you can push your needle between the layers and out through the front about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the edge. Then cut off the excess thread very close to the top layer of the fabric. The thread should be pulled inside, hiding the knot from view.

, Now that you have mastered the blanket stitch you can experiment with new styles for different looks. The blanket stitch may be varied in many ways by:


Sloping the stitches alternately to right and left
Working two or three together, and leaving a space between them and the next set; or
Working a second row around the edge of the cloth over the first with a different shade of wool.

Thread the needle with an easily seen color of thread.,

Bring the needle back up at point C, from the back of the fabric again.,
Reinsert the needle below point C stitch, a little way down.",How to Sew Fly Stitch," This is for practice, so make it easy on yourself an use a colorful thread. Even embroidery thread is good for practicing with, as it's easy to see. Knot one end of the thread to prevent it from coming right through the fabric when pulled up.
, Bring up from the back of the fabric to the front of it., This should be opposite the first stitch a little way. Do not pull the thread tight. This should form a ""loop""., This should be about midway between the loop made by the previous two stitches but lower down, so as to form a V shape. As you bring up the needle, catch the loop with the needle. Now you can pull tight and a basic V shape will be formed, with the loop stretched down on each side from points A and B by the stitch created by C., This time, you have a choice to decide to keep the V shape, in which case, keep the end stitch close to the base of the V, or you can make a Y shape by taking the reinsertion point a little further down and pulling tight.

The choice of either the V or the Y formation will be determined by the final look you're seeking. For example, the Y shape is very useful for forming flower stems if embroidering ribbon flowers or buds.
Do a row of these stitches horizontally or randomly to create a field or flower bed of flowers. Alternatively, keep working downward in a neat line from the first fly stitch to make a vine or joined pattern. If making a row straight down, always come up where you left the last V or Y shape.

Repeat the pattern as needed.,
Create your final full stitch.,
Make a half stitch in between layers.,
Tie a finishing knot.,
Flatten the stitches.",How to Whipstitch1," Feed one end of the thread into your sewing needle and draw the thread halfway through. Tie both ends together into a knot.


If you want to camouflage the whipstitch, use thread in a coordinating color. If you want the whipstitch to stand out, use thread of a contrasting color.
Embroidery thread works well for this stitch, but any thick thread can be used.
To tie the knot, try moistening your forefinger. Wrap the thread around your forefinger once. Then use your thumb to push the thread off your finger, twisting it in the process. Finally, pull the end of the thread to tighten the knot.;
, Make sure that the edges you intend to sew together are evenly aligned. The sides of the fabric which you intend to be the backend should face out so as to be visible during the process. The thread you use here will be more visible.


Pin or baste the layers together to hold them in place.

, While looking at the two layers of fabric from the side, draw the needle up through the bottom of the top layer, leaving the bottom layer untouched.


Start your stitch about 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) from the end.Also note that each stitch you make should be 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from your sewn edge, as well.
By only piercing through the top layer, you will draw the knot between the two layers, thereby hiding it from sight.

, Circle the needle around to the bottom layer of fabric and pierce through the fabric directly under your first hole. Draw it straight through both layers of fabric, making sure that it comes out in nearly the same position as your first half-stitch.


This is your first full stitch since it connects both layers together.
When you complete this step, the thread should be wrapped around the edges of both layers in an even stitch, forming a loop around the outside of the fabric.Make sure that the stitch is secure, but not so tight that it causes the fabric to bunch up.

, Bring the needle back to the bottom of the fabric and poke it up through both layers of fabric. Angle the needle so that it comes out roughly 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the first stitch.


This second stitch will essentially cover the first stitch.
Pull the thread tight. When done, you should only be able to see what appears to be one stitch, but the thread should come out from fabric in a blank spot next to the stitch.
Each stitch should be approximately 1/8 inch from one another and from the edge of the fabric, so that each stich is parallel., Position the needle beneath the bottom side of the fabric. Poke it up into both layers of fabric, beginning just beneath the spot at which the thread is coming up. Angle the needle so that it comes out through the top another 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the previous stitch.


The stitch itself should not appear angular, however. It should run straight up and down over the edge, parallel to the first stitch., Continue making stitches that mimic the previous one. Draw the needle up through both layers, starting at a point beneath the previous stitch and ending at a position 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away. Do this until you reach the end of the edge.


Note that the majority of your stitches will follow this pattern, but your last full stitch and half stitch will be different and will mimic the stitches you made at the beginning of the process.

, For your final full stitch, pierce the needle through the bottom layer and draw it straight up through both layers instead of stitching at an angle. This stitch should be made 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) away from the edge of the fabric, just as the first one was.

, Poke the needle up through the bottom layer again, in the same spot as your previous stitch. Only bring the thread through the bottom layer, however, and not the top layer.


In this step, you are mirroring the initial half stitch you created at the beginning of the process. This stitch will be hidden in between both layers of fabric., Draw the needle through the back of the last stitch you made. Pull the layers apart slightly to reveal the backside of your stitches. Open up the pieces of fabric like two leaves of a book. Wrap the needle through your last stitch, creating a loose loop in the process. Thread the fabric back around, twisting it around the original loop. Then pull tight.This knot should also be hidden in between the two layers of fabric.
After creating the knot, cut your thread to free it from the needle. Trim it short so that it cannot be visible from the front side.

, Gently pull the two layers apart, causing the stitches to flatten evenly against the fabric. This step completes the process."

Find a new piece of yarn or leave a tail from the original crochet.,
Thread your yarn needle.,
Line up your two pieces of crochet.,
Insert the needle through a loop on each crochet piece.,
Circle back around through the same loops.,
Move to the next loop.,
Repeat as needed.,
Make a knot.,
Check your work.",How to Whipstitch2," Ideally, you should already have a tail of yarn, remaining from the crochet. If not, tie a new strand of yarn to the bottom stitch of one edge.


The yarn you use for this stitch should be three to four times longer than your finished edge.Use the same color yarn as one or both pieces of crochet work you intend to join. Unlike the whipstitch used in sewing, the whipstitch used in crocheting is meant to be far less visible, so you will usually want to hide the stitch further by using one of the colors already in the pattern.

, Insert the yarn through the eye of your yarn needle. Do not knot the ends of the yarn together. Pull at least 3 to 4 inches (3.75 to 10 cm) of yarn through the eye of the needle. You will need this long starting portion to ensure that the needle remains threaded throughout the process.


You will also need to monitor this non-working length of the yarn as you make your whipstitch. If it starts to get short, tug a little more yarn through the eye of the needle to prevent it from falling out. Should the yarn fall out during the process, simply re-thread it.

, Make sure that the two edges you want to stitch together are evenly aligned side by side.


The back sides of both pieces should face out during this process.

, Draw the needle up through the front loop on the edge of one crochet through to back loop of the edge of the other piece of crochet, not yet threaded.

, Take the yarn back through the last two loops. Pull the yarn tight to create a knot to hold the pieces together tight.The yarn needs to be pulled tightly enough to draw the two pieces of crochet snugly together. Do not pull it too tight, however, since doing so can cause bunching or similar distortions to occur in your work.

, Draw the needle through the next loop on the top crochet. then poke the needle through the following loop of your opposite edge. The pattern should look like a spiral, moving up the edge of the crochet.


Start with the piece of crochet your yarn is connected to and end the stitch through the opposing piece.You can pull the yarn through either one or two loops on each of the crochet pieces, depending upon what type of pattern you want., Insert the needle through the next set of loops on both edges, drawing the yarn taut through both sets. Continue this pattern, moving upward one set of loops at a time, until you reach the end of both edges.


Make sure that each stitch passes through the front and back loops of both sides.
Each stitch should be about as tight as your first one was. The edge should be secured well enough so that no space remains between both pieces, but do not allow the pieces to bunch up as you work., Wrap the yarn through the last loop of your opposing edge and then back through the same set of loops again. Pull this end and draw the loop closed, creating a knot.Weave the tail along the back side of your crochet work to hide it.
If you have an excess longer than 1 inch (2.5 cm), you can trim some of it off.

, Flip the joined pieces over to the front side. The whipstitch should be nearly invisible front the front.

Turn the fabric inside out.",How to Sew a Scalloped Edge," Creating a scalloped edge for a garment is quite easy, but you will need to have some special materials handy before you get started. You will need:


Fabric. Make sure that you use something that will hold its shape, such as cotton, wool, and linen.Round item to use as a guide for creating scallops, such as a bowl, cup, or coin. You can make the scallops as small or as large as you like.
Freezer paper (optional). You can use freezer paper to create a template for you scallops and then sew around this template instead of drawing the scallops directly on the fabric.Pencil or fabric chalk.
Scissors.
Measuring tape and ruler.
Sewing machine.;
, If you are adding a scalloped edge to a finished garment, such as for the hem of a skirt, then you will need to know how long to make the edge. Measure the edge of garment or fabric piece that you want to add a scalloped edge onto and write down this measurement., Before you trace your scallops into your actual garment, it is helpful to practice the design on a piece of paper first. This can help you to find the ideal size for your piece. Start by drawing a straight line on the paper, and then place of the round objects on the line so that only about half or less than half of it is on one side of the line. Trace around the rounded edge to create your first scallop.After you make the first scallop, slide the round object over so that the edge is lined up with the edge of the first scallop you traced onto the paper. Then, draw another scallop in the same way.
Continue to create scallops in this way until you are happy with the design.
If you are planning to make a template using freezer paper to guide your work, then trace your scalloped design onto the freezer paper. Then, cut along the curved edges and cut the paper so that there is about a two inch strip between the deepest curve of the scallops and the other edge of the paper.

, Make sure that the right sides (printed sides) of the fabric are facing inwards and that the edges are even.If you are using a fabric that does not fray easily, then you may be able to simply sew along the edge of one piece of fabric and then trim the fabric up to the seam., If you plan to draw directly on your fabric, then start by creating a line that is far enough away from the edge of your fabric to accommodate the size of your scallops. Then, trace the scallops the same way that you did while experimenting on paper.If you are using a template made from freezer paper, then you can simply pin the template onto your fabric.

, Whether you traced your scallops directly onto the fabric or you are using a template, you will need to sew along the curved edges. Use your sewing machine to sew a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch along the curved edges.If you are using a template, be careful not to sew over the paper. Try to sew as close to the paper as possible without letting the needle pierce the paper.

, After you have created the scalloped seam, you can trim off the excess fabric to reveal the scalloped shapes in your fabric. Trim the fabric along the curved edges, but allow about ¼” to ½” seam allowance.If you only used one piece of fabric, then you can trim right up to the edge of the seam and your scalloped edge is finished.

, To ensure that the scallops lay nicely after you turn the fabric inside out, cut out some small triangles in the seam allowance fabric along the edges of the scallops. Cut out a triangle of fabric about every ¼” to ½” and be careful not to cut into the seam stitch., To finish the scalloped edge, turn the fabric inside out so that the seam and triangle notches you cut into the fabric will be hidden. Push your fingers into the inside of each scallop to ensure that they all have a nice curved shape.If the scallops look lumpy, then you may need to iron out the edges to make them lay flat.

, Lightly mark in pencil where you want to sew.

, Push the needle down through the layers to sew a single stitch, about the width of a fingerprint. This is called a ""running"" stitch.

, Pull the needle through the fabric firmly but not too tightly or it will pucker. Repeat the stitches until you have come to the end of your fabric or pattern.

Stitch the unsewn bias tape onto the the fabric.,
Understitch the armhole.,
Turn your garment inside out and secure the bias tape.",How to Use Bias Tape1," Use double-fold bias tape and press the center of the fold to flatten it. You want to flatten several feet of bias tape, keeping it attached to the packing cardboard it came with to ensure that you maximize the amount you use.The bias tape will be cut to length, keeping it attached to the cardboard ensures that you do not waste any extra tape.;
, Make sure that you keep the edge flat by pressing the the top edge as you position your bias tape with an inch extending beyond the seam. Align the right sides of your fabric with the raw edge of your bias tape.

, Your bias tape should go around the entirety of the circumference of your armhole. Pin the bias tape about every 2 inches along the armhole. Ease the bias tape around the curves of the armhole by slightly stretching it so that it fits snuggly., After you have completely pinned your tape around the armhole, there should be about 1 inch of tape extending beyond the seam before you trim it. There should be two pieces of bias tape that are the same length. The extra tape will look like tails., Center the seam of your bias tape over the seam of the armpit of your armhole. Pin through both layers of bias tape at a perpendicular angle making sure not to pin through your fabric.The pin will be places where the bias tape tails come together, flat against your fabric.

, Begin the stitch about 1 inch in front of the adjoined bias tape and armpit seam. Backstitch and allow for a ⅜ inch seam as the stitch continues down the ironed crease. Stop about 1 inch short of the armpit. Backstitch to finish off.As you sew remove all the pins along the armhole but leave the pin holding the tails.
Take it slow if this is your first time sewing a seam like this.

, Snip the threads as the fabric is removed from under your presser foot. The tails of the bias tape should be removed from the fabric as you make a vertical stitch down the shorter side of your bias tape. The shorter length will be where you had the pins located. Use a backstitch on the entire length of the tape making sure that you’re only sewing the tape and not the fabric.

, Use scissors to cut the tails of your bias tape to ¼ inch and pin the tape against the fabric. Align the armpit seam and bias tape seam as you stitch the unsewn tape onto the fabric.Give a ⅜ inch seam allowance. Press both the seam allowance and bias tape away from your fabric.

, Stitch the bias tape ⅛ inch from the seam on the right side. Understitching creates a crisp armhole as the bias tape hides in the inside of the armhole and lays flat to prevent irritating your arms.Understitching should be done each time you work with bias tape because it prevents the bias tape from showing outside of your armhole if it’s not pressed flush against the fabric. Using a contrasting colour of bias tape can appear to be a glaring mistake if you do not use understitching or understitch poorly.

, Pin the bias tape every 2 inches as you press it securely against the inside of your garment. Sew the tape allowing for a ⅛ inch seam. Secure the tape into the garment from the inside edge. Begin sewing at the armpit seam.Turn the garment right side out and make sure that your armholes are pressed to keep the finish crisp."

Prepare the bias tape and use flat hair pins to align with your fabric.,
Use your sewing machine to stitch along the folded crease of tape.,
Turn the project face up and secure the tape.,
Change the bobbin thread.",How to Use Bias Tape2," Turn your garment inside out and place the fabric onto a flat surface with the wrong side facing up. Use bias tape to measure the edge of the fabric as the length of bias tape should be the same as the edge of the fabric that you want to encase., Once unwrapped, find the wider side of the bias tape and place it on the back of the fabric. Alight the raw edge by using flat hair clips instead of standard sewing pins.Bias tape will always have a slightly wider back side than the front because it allows you to easily catch the back portion when stitching from the front.

, Remove the hair clips as you sew along the folded crease of tape. Backtack at the start and end of the stitch. Use a bobbin thread to match the main fabric and not the bias tape as this will be visible when worn so you want it the thread to be as subtle as possible.Backtack is also known as a backstitch and refers to stitching at the beginning and end of a seam line in the reverse direction. You only need to backtack for a few stitches to secure the stitch. Most sewing machines provide this function with a simple knob or button., The raw edge should be wrapped with the bias tape and secured with hair clips. The stitching you created with the sewing machine should now be covered by the edge of the bias tape. Gently pull the tape as you fold it up and over the raw edge of the material. You want the tape to lie as straight and flat as you can.If you pull the tape too hard over the fabric as you fold it over, it may pucker once you stitch it.

, Remove the bobbin thread and replace it with a thread that matches the colour of the tape and stitch the tape. Backtack at the start and end of your stitching. Remove your clips as you closely stitch to the front edge of the bias tape. Catch the back side of the tape as you stitch."

Measure the edge of your fabric.,
Prepare the bias tape and use flat hair pins to align with your fabric.,
Mark the joining points of the edges of the tape.,
Stitch along the joining line.,
Stitch in the crease on the back side of the tape.",How to Use Bias Tape3," Use bias tape to measure your fabric. Make sure that there’s a 3 inch overlap of tape. Turn your garment inside out and place the fabric onto a flat surface with the wrong side facing up. You need 3 inches of tape to make sure it overlaps at the point where the two ends of the tape will meet.Stitching along a curved edge can be challenging so using this technique keeps the tape secured with the stitching on the inside and not visible when worn.

, Find the wider side of the bias tape and place it on the back of the fabric. Affix the wide edge with flat hair clips instead of standard sewing pins., The joined tape should be exactly as long as the raw edge of the fabric. Use a water soluble marker and a pin to mark the point at which the tape joins together once you’ve pinched the overlapping ends together., Match the bias tape with same coloured thread and stitch along the joining line. Press the seam open once you have trimmed it to ¼ inch. Keep the bias tape secured to the raw edge of the garment with hair clips., Encase the raw edge of the garment by folding over the tape and stitching it as close to the front edge as you can. Stitch all the way around the project to create an inconspicuous seam, removing the hair clips as you secure the garment within the tape. The two ends of the bias tape should meet once finished.Backtack at the start and end of the stitch.
This should take away bulky overlap and create a tidy seam that won’t be visible when worn.

Pull the entire fabric through the bias tape maker.",How to Use Bias Tape4," Whether you purchase it online or from your local arts or fabric store, you will basically only need bias tape maker to go along with an iron, ironing board, scissors, and sewing machine. You may also use a rotary cutter and mat. Bias tape comes in an assortment of widths, styles, and colours.A bias tape maker can come with a variety of openings which will determine the width of your bias tape.

, Before ironing out any wrinkles, spray starch onto the fabric to ensure that it will be easy to work with. Begin with a fabric that measures about 22 inches x 28 inches., Take the bottom right corner and fold it upwards toward the top most edge of your fabric. The bias fold will be the line on which you cut. Rotate your fabric so that the bias edge lines up with the cutting edge of your cutting mat., Use the cutting edge of your cutting mat to guide you as you trim 1/8″ off the fold of the fabric. Use your cutting mat to realign your cut edge of the fabric. Cut 1 inch strips until you have made 10 strips.Continue to realign the edge of the fabric as you make a new cut. You should make 5 cuts to give you 10 strips that measure 1 inch x 20 inches., Form a right angle with the bias strips. Match the bottom right corner of a strip with the top left corner the edge of another strip. The right sides of the strips should be placed together., Line up the ⅝ inch seam guide of your sewing machine with the raw edge of your fabric to keep your strips at a 45 degree angle and seam straight. Use scissors to trim any excess fabric.

, Press the seams so that they remain open. On one end of the fabric, create a 45 degree angle by cutting the fabric. Place this end through bias tape maker., Make sure to continue pressing down to keep the seam open as you pull the fabric through the bias tape maker. The seam will be very subtle and your 22 inch by 28 inch fabric will create 9 yards of bias tape."

, This is the Top of Shoulder/Base of Neck to Apex measurement.

, This is the distance between your nipples.

, The spot referred to as the Ribcage in sewing is located right underneath your breast where the cups of your bra end. So, you are measuring the distance from your nipple to there.

, This is not necessarily the spot where your pants sit. It is the spot where you bend if you you lean over, right above the belly button.

,, It's where the elastic top of a bikini style panty will usually sit.


If you are wanting to also adjust your garment around the largest part of your rear end you will want to include the Lower Hip as well. Measure approximately 6"" down from the Mid Hip to find the Lower Hip measurement.

Try your garment on again, this time right side out.",How to Use Princess Seams to Take in Your Clothing2," Turn your garment you want to adjust inside out and fold in half down the front from the neck to the hemline. This fold should follow the centre front. Make sure it's straight.

, Measure down from the Top of the Shoulder, parallel to the centre front of the garment and place your chalk mark.

,, Now you should have a ""+"" or ""X"" marking on your garment. That ""+"" or ""X"" marks the exact spot of your Apex. This is where your Princess seam will start from.

, This is the line that the Princess seam will follow.

, If you've used white chalk it will easily wash out.

,, The Front side of the garment should be folded in half with each half facing each other so the chalk line can transfer properly. The side seams of the garment should match up.

, This helps the chalk transfer.

, You should see two lines down the front of your garment that are exactly the same. If they are not the you should rub out one of the chalk lines and try again.

, With the two lines on the front side, so you can look down your stomach and see them.

, Try to shape the seams so that they taper with the most fabric being taken in around the Waist and the least at the ends of the seams (Apex and Mid Hip). You will want the seam to taper smoothly at the ends to the flat, open fabric.

, If not, adjust and try your garment on again.

,, If everything fits then you're done. If not, stitch rip the seams and try again.

",How to Use Sewing Skills to Financial Advantage," The world's biggest online marketplace is at your fingertips. Find a popular (sewn) item...blankets, shirts, hats, etc. Check carefully what items sell for. Can you make a profit if you were to sell at that price? Make a sample and add up your costs and time. Usually people double their costs when they set a price. If you think you can make a true profit, then make it and sell it on eBay . Look on Google for popular items you can sew and sell on eBay .;
, Most people in their lifetime pop a button off of their shirt, break a seam, etc. You could mend these items for people to make a profit! You need to know what should be charged for basic repairs or alterations: pant hems, skirt hems, taking in a waistline, letting out a waist. How long will these projects take? How much will you pay yourself per hour? What are your costs? (machine, phone, electricity, publicity etc.) It may require a business license in your town, so check this out first. Also look in the yellow pages to see how many alterations businesses are nearby (who is the competition?). See if a dry cleaner is looking for an alterations person. You may be able to work there and meet new customers.

, Custom sewing is a good way to work at home: weddings, formals, even drill teams and choral groups need custom sewn outfits. Send publicity fliers or brochures to those groups about your new business. Have a nice place for people to come to when they meet you. Have a good room that is well lit and clean for them to fit the garments. You will need to know your expenses: wages, electricity, machine costs, etc. Factor those costs into what you charge for your work. Have a contract form for your customers to sign that lists what they will pay. Before you start any project, have them pay you in cash at least half of the costs. Decide if you or the customer will pay for the fabric (it's better if they do that). Be prepared to ask for money from your clients. Some people will try to pay you less or not pay at all. Other people will ask for all sorts of changes and fit that you did not plan on, so be firm and have a good written contract. When you get good at this, you may find that some stores or bridal salons can use you as a consultant to alter ready-made dresses and garments.

Cut your thread.,
Neaten the thread.,
Match needle with thread.",How to Thread a Needle1," The length, color, and type of thread will depend on what you're sewing. Make sure that it's long enough for your purposes! In general, a thread about 18-24 inches in length should be plenty to begin with., Examine the tip that you plan to put through the needle, and make sure that it is sharp and tight. Moisten and squeeze the tip by putting it between your lips. Bring the strands to a sharp point that will fit through the eye of the needle. If the tip of the thread is uneven, trim it down with scissors.

, Compare the eye (the hole at the top) of the needle with the thickness of the thread. The thread should be able to easily fit through the eye. If the thread is too thick, try to find a thinner thread or a needle with a wider eye. If you're new to sewing, and the work isn't terribly intricate, try using a needle with a large eye for easier threading."
"
Hold the thread in one hand and the needle in the other.,
Guide the thread into the eye of the needle.,
Pull the thread through.",How to Thread a Needle2," At first, it's generally easiest to grip the needle between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. Hold the thread comfortably between the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand. Raise the needle and the thread up to your eye level, about two inches apart. Make sure that there's plenty of light to see everything clearly!


Consider pinching the thread between your fingers so that only the tiniest tip is visible. If you're having trouble, this technique might help you steady the thread., Line the tip of the thread up with the eye-hole, and make sure that you have a clear view of the hole. Keep your hands steady. Push the thread slowly and surely through the eye-hole until you see it poke through the other side.


Try holding the needle sideways, so that you can't see the eye, but you can see the thread as soon as it peeks through the eye.This may take a couple of attempts. Keep trying! If you're having trouble, try moistening and smoothing the tip of the thread again.
If you keep trying, but you can't get it, consider using a needle with a bigger eye-hole.

, Use your fingertips to carefully tug more of the thread through the eye. Go for at least 10cm (four inches) so that there's little chance of the thread-tip slipping back through.Let this end hang through the needle eye, and shift your attention to the other end of the thread.

Tighten the thread.",How to Thread a Needle3," Let one end of the thread hang through the eye of the needle. Hold the other, longer end between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. Make sure that you have a sturdy grip!

, Loosely loop the end of the thread around your finger – enough that it is secure, but not so tightly that it cuts off circulation. Wrap the thread three times around for sturdiness.

, Use the thumb of the same hand to roll and slide the thread off the tip of your forefinger. The thread should form a tangled loop as you do this. Don't worry if it doesn't look neat – as long as there's a loop!

, Grasp the loose loop between your thumb and forefinger. Now, pull it down toward the end of the thread until it tightens into a knot. This process is simple, but may take a little practice. Once you've knotted the end of the thread, you can be sure that it won't slip through the eye of the needle. Make sure that the knot is thicker than the eye is wide!"

Finish the seams.",How to Sew Silk," Silk fabric has a tendency to shrink, which can alter the size and look of your sewing project. By prewashing the fabric, you will minimize the amount of shrinkage that might occur when you wash the fabric after you’ve completed the project. Typically, silk will shrink about 5-10%, with some looser weavers shrinking up to 15%.Use a mild detergent, such as Woolite or Ivory Snow, with warm water, washing the silk in a sink or bucket. Alternately, use a mild shampoo.
You can also wash some silk fabrics in the washing machine. Use a delicate cycle and a mild detergent.A few silks, such as dupioni, should be dry cleaned only.;
, If you have bright or deep colored silk, it’s best to wash these separately. Dyes used on silk have a tendency to run, and you don’t want to discolor your fabric. Take the time to do separate washes to ensure that colors don’t bleed from one piece to another.Prewashing strong colors will also ensure that the colors don’t bleed after you have sewn your project.

, Vinegar will help get rid of the soap residue that remains on the fabric. In a bucket or sink, mix in ¼ cup of white vinegar per gallon of water. Swish around the silk fabric to rinse out the soap. Drain the water and leave the silk in the sink.

, Put the fabric through a second rinse, this time without vinegar. The clean water will rinse out any remaining vinegar and will remove the vinegar odor.

, After you finish hand washing the fabric, do not twist or wring it out to remove excess water. Rather, lay the fabric out on a towel and then lay another towel on top.


You can remove some extra moisture by ironing over the top towel using a medium temperature., There are several methods of drying silk fabric, depending on your preference. Try partially drying the fabric in the dryer. Remove the fabric when it is still damp and hang up to finish drying.


Alternately, you can dry the silk between two towels, or let it hang dry right after you have washed it.

, Because silk is slippery, use very sharp scissors so that the cuts you make to the fabric will be smooth and clean.It may be useful to have regular sewing shears as well as pinking shears. Pinking shears are scissors that cut little triangles along the edge of fabric. This can help with fraying, which silk has a tendency to do.

, A fine, sharp needle will leave smaller holes in the silk fabric. Since silk is prone to showing holes easily, choose a small-sized needle to use when sewing your project.


A 60/8 Microtex or Universal needle is an ideal size.Have a few spare needles on hand while you work on your project. It is a good idea to replace needles every so often so that you are constantly using a very sharp needle. Silk fibers are quite tough and can dull the needle easily.
If you are hand-sewing, choose a very sharp, fine needle.

, Choose a thread to match your fabric. Cotton-wrapped or 100% polyester thread are good choices. While some people might like to use silk thread with silk fabric, silk thread is not very strong and can fray easily., The foot on a sewing machine will press down the fabric while the needle moves up and down. A flat-bottomed foot is recommended, as it will not snag on the silk as the fabric moves through the machine.


Alternately, choose a walking foot, which keeps the silk from sliding around.

, Working with a clean, dust-free machine is a good rule of thumb whenever you sew, but it is particularly important when sewing a delicate fabric such as silk. Wipe down the machine to remove any residue on the machine. To remove dust, you can use a pressurized air canister to blow air into the crevices and cracks of your machine.

, When you are ready to start handling your fabric, wash your hands with soap and water. Dry them thoroughly. This will remove any residue or oils from your hands that could spot the fabric.


This is especially important if you are hand-sewing the fabric.

, Having tissue paper, muslin, or even butcher paper will help keep the silk fabric from slipping when you cut it with your scissors.


Tissue paper is especially useful because you can continue using it to stabilize your fabric, including when you pin and sew the fabric.

, You can also use a spray-on fabric stabilizer, which will stiffen the fabric somewhat and make it easier to manage while you cut it. This is available at fabric stores and online.

, Silk pins are extra fine pins that leave very tiny holes in silk fabric. These are useful for pinning patterns to fabric without noticeably marring the surface of the fabric. Pattern weights are used to hold fabric stationary on the cutting surface so that it doesn’t shift around when you are cutting. You can also use heavy objects such as canned food to hold down the fabric., With other types of fabric, you can usually cut same-shaped pattern pieces together, doubling up the fabric. With silk, however, it’s best to cut each pattern piece individually. Silk slips around too much, and cutting through two layers of fabric might cause errors in cutting out the pattern.For pattern pieces on a fold, redraw the piece as it would be folded out. This way, you won’t have to cut two layers of fabric at once.

, Silk pins are extra fine pins that leave very tiny holes in silk fabric. These are useful for pinning fabric pieces together without noticeably marring the surface of the fabric.Alternately, use wonder clips or binder clips to clip fabric together.

, The seam allowances are the areas of the fabric along the edges that will not show in the final sewing project. Since silk will show holes very easily, pin fabric together in the seam allowances to avoid poking holes in noticeable places.Typical sewing allowances are ½ inch or 5/8 inch in width.

, Iron the silk fabric to make seams more visible when you sew them. Ironing seams will also keep them in place while you sew. Use a low setting on your iron, and put a press cloth over your fabric to avoid direct contact with your fabric.


Many irons have a silk setting, which is appropriate to use for this purpose.

, Silk has a tendency to fray easily, and after you prewash the fabric, there may be more frays than a brand-new piece of fabric. Cut edges to remove frays and to make the edges even. Trim away any loose threads.

, Hand-basting is a technique of using long, loose stitches to hold fabric together and make sewing easier. Since silk is so slippery, it can be helpful to hand-baste the pieces with a stitch that looks like a dotted line.


Read “How to Do the Basting Stitch” for more information.

, If your silk fabric is slipping too much while sewing, try layering a piece of tissue paper underneath your sewing area. The needle will sew through both layers, sewing them together.


When you’re done sewing the piece, you can just tear away the tissue paper.

, You can also use a spray-on fabric stabilizer, which will stiffen the fabric somewhat and make it easier to manage while you cut it. This is available at fabric stores and online.

, Check how your sewing machine settings will respond to the silk by test sewing on a scrap piece of silk. Make adjustments to the tension and gauge of your thread before you move on to sewing your project.Aim for 8-12 stitches per inch, although this might vary depending on your project., As you set the fabric in place at your sewing machine, pull the top thread and bobbin thread back away from you. This will ensure that it won’t get accidentally wrapped up in the machine foot, which could cause holes or pulls in the fabric as you sew it.

, Rotate the hand wheel to bring the needle down into the fabric. This will ensure that the sewing machine will start very slowly and the fabric won’t pucker or catch on the foot., Gently flatten the fabric so that it feeds straight into the machine. Don’t pull it taut, however, as this can cause puckers in the final sewing project.

, Start out your stitching with a few stitches and then secure them by backstitching along them. This will ensure that the stitches won’t come out. Do so very carefully, so that you don’t accidentally allow the silk fabric to creep or bunch up at the beginning.

, Silk has a tendency to bunch and gather, so go slowly when you’re sewing this fabric. Try a steady pace to ensure that the stitches are even and consistent.

, Slow down or pause to make sure the fabric is feeding properly through the machine. Look at your seams to see if they are sewing flat and without any snags.

, Ripping out seams from silk fabric is risky, as this may leave holes in the fabric that you will be able to see even after the project is finished. Decide if seam ripping is necessary. If yes, then proceed very carefully and slowly.


To minimize holes, rub the holes on the underside of the fabric with your fingernail. Dampen the fabric by spraying it lightly with water, and then iron it on a low to medium setting., Silk will fray very easily, and that can compromise the quality of your sewing project if the edges fray all the way to where the stitches are. Finish the seams with a serged finish or a French seam.


For a serged finish, you need a serger. It is the cleanest method, as it sews up the edge of the fabric and seals it within the serged area.
You can also use other finishing methods, such as zigzag, seam binding and hand-overcast."

Get a thread roll and a needle.,
Pick the right needle for the cloth.,
Make sure that you have enough thread.,
Thread the needle.,
Knot the thread.",How to Sew Up Holes1," If possible, use thread that matches the color of your clothing. If the stitch won't be visible from outside the garment, then the color of the thread does not matter. You may also choose to use a vibrantly-colored thread to complement or contrast with the fabric.;
, If the fabric is thick and tough (denim, leather, and multi-layered cloth), use a sharp, heavy needle so that you can pierce the cloth without too much effort. If the fabric is soft or thin, you may use any needle – though you might want to use a more delicate needle.Cotton, nylon, silk, jute, mixed fabric, and any other thin, soft fabric is better stitched with a lighter needles. The needle can be as short as 1-2 inches, or longer as needed. If you use a thick needle—approximately 1 mm in thickness—it may leave visible holes in the fabric. You may use a finger cap to prevent being poked by the needle while stitching.
Opt for a thicker needle to avoid breaking any needles. Use a solid board to push the needle through while stitching if your finger hurts. Some thick fabrics like denim need pushing against a hard surface.

, If unsure, try laying the thread over the torn area for reference. Take about 10 inches more than you think you'll need. The in-and-out sewing motion will take up a lot of thread, and you'll also need a bit more thread than the needle's length in order to tie the final knot. Remember: the thicker the fabric, the more thread you'll need. You may choose to take two times more thread if the fabric is thicker than 5mm.

, Make sure that the tip of the thread is tight, not split. If the tip is frayed: wet it, then roll it with your fingers so that it goes easily through the eye of the needle.Try using a needle threader if you have trouble., Hold both ends of the thread. Tie a small knot to keep the far tip (the one that you didn't thread through the eye of the needle) from slipping through the fabric after the needle.


If you intend to make a stitch to a torn knit wear, then you must make a bigger effort. Knit wear or woolen clothes contain much bigger gaps than other fabrics. Here, to begin with, you must make a knot with the threaded needle so that your thread has something holding it in place.

Identify a split seam.,
Turn the garment inside out.,
Sew along the seam line.",How to Sew Up Holes2," Compared to a larger hole, a split seam is fairly easy to deal with. This means: where two pieces of fabric were joined by stitching, the thread is broken or missing and the seam is now open, creating a ""hole."" In most cases, you can simply sew the seam back together.This can be inside a pocket, causing all your change to drop through. It may also appear in a sleeve seam, causing your elbow to stick out.

, Expose the seam. You may wish to gently iron the garment on the appropriate heat setting for the fabric, and then pin the seams carefully back together.

, Sew by hand (needle and thread) or machine along the original seam line with nice, small stitches for strength. Overlap the intact part of the original seam, and make sure to knot the thread well. Carefully clip any hanging threads to finish the job.Sometimes, you will need to deal with top-stitching rather than a seam: as in an applique or a patch pocket. In this case, you will want to exactly match the thread to the original, since it will be highly visible. Try to match the stitch length in making the repair.

"
"
Evaluate the missing fabric.,
Use a reinforcing patch.,
Strengthen the torn ends.,
Circle back next to the first stitch.,
Finish the job.",How to Sew Up Holes3," The most difficult type of hole to sew up is one where there is actually fabric missing – as in a worn-out hole in the knees of trousers, or in the elbow of a jacket. Do not try to sew the hole up without adding any additional fabric. This will only pucker the fabric together, tugging at the shape of the garment and creating a messy lump., If the hole is frayed into the seam line or somewhere in the middle of the garment (other than a seam), then you will need to reinforce the area. Cut to size a small piece of fabric of the same weight and color of the garment. Lay the patching fabric under the hole, right side up. Then, bring the edges of the hole as close together as possible, without puckering the hole. Use a small zig zag stitch on the sewing machine to stitch around the edges of hole, catching as much fabric (patch and garment) as possible to make the patch hold.This isn't going to be a ""pretty fix,"" but it should be serviceable. If the garment is casual, you can buy extra fabric in a contrasting color or pattern and sew patches in several areas to make the hole patch look decorative. Do this patch from the outside of the garment, or use appliqués in the same manner to add a designer touch.

, Start stitching about an inch before the torn area. This is especially important if an existing stitch was loosened or ripped. Stitching a little back from the ends will support the fabric and stop further tearing. Slip the needle through the cloth, and carefully weave the thread in and out of the cloth. For consistency, try to keep the distance between each stitch to about 2 mm.


If the hole is especially frayed, try reinforcing with a liquid seam sealant before you start stitching. This can help make the fix more sustainable.
If the cloth is too tight, a stitch may tear again once you wear the garment. Try adding another layer of a piece of a cloth beneath the hole, and then stitching that cloth for added strength. Try stitching a button to the area, if it goes with the fabric. Consider darning the hole so the space is filled with many interlacing stitches.

, Repeat until there is nothing left to sew.


If the cloth is badly frayed, it may require an ""over-locking."" Hold the cloth and stitch it so that the frayed end is folded inwards. Fold the cloth one or two times, then stitch it ""shut"" to prevent the cloth from tearing again.

, Stretch and press the cloth. Take care that the thread does not get tangled midway through the stitch. Press the stitched area between your fingers. Then, run through the stitch to remove air gaps or unevenness of the cloth. To finish the job, make a knot and snip the thread.

"
"
Try using an iron-on patch for heavier fabrics.,
Make the patch discreet.,
Hand-sew a patch for thinner fabrics.",How to Sew Up Holes4," You can simply lay the patch over the hole, then iron it flat with enough heat that the patch binds to the fabric. Make sure to reinforce an iron-on patch with stitching around the edges. Trim the square corners to a rounded shape before ironing them onto the garment. Both the stitching and the corner trimming will increase the useful life of the patch.Iron-on patches are suitable for heavier fabrics such as denim and canvas. However, they may distort the shape of thinner fabrics.

, If the hole is in a visible part of the garment, prepare the self patch from the inside. If this isn't possible, purchase fabric as close in color to the garment as possible in a fabric with the same properties.Alternately, pick a patch that stands out. For some, patched clothing is a stylistic choice.

, First, trim the frayed threads and treat the hole's edges with seam sealant. Make two patches: one with any fabric for the bottom, and one with the matching/self fabric for the top patch.Treat the edges of the bottom patch with seam sealant. Then, turn a small amount of fabric at the edge of your top patch, and iron this folded edge in place.


Use the free embroidery settings on your sewing machine. Place the bottom patch underneath the hole, and run the lines of stitching very close together to completely catch all edges of the hole onto the bottom patch.
Sew the bottom patch into place. Stitch back and forth, and up and down, creating a ""fabric"" of stitching across the hole or tear. Sew in straight stitch all around the edges of the bottom patch to keep the hole reinforced.
Cover with the top patch. Place the folded-edge side down onto the fabric so it completely covers all the machine stitching. Hand-sew with matching thread (applique style) onto the top of the garment. Work the thread around it several times for strength. If you prefer a ""rustic"" look, you can also embroider with blanket stitch around this patch.
