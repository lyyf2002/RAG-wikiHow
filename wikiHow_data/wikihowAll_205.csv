Knot the stitch in the back.",How to Do a Zigzag Stitch by Hand1," Insert the needle through the fabric at the starting point of your stitch line, A. Poke through from the back of the fabric to the front.


Pull the needle and thread completely through so that the end knot lies flush against the back of the fabric.
Your A point should be at the bottom right edge of your desired stitch line.;
, Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a position directly above your A point. This new insertion point will be point B.


Pull the needle and thread completely through to the back of the fabric, creating a flat vertical stitch between A and B. This stitch must be straight, not slanted.
The distance between A and B will be the width of your stitch. Unless otherwise specified, a width of 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) should suffice.

, Insert the needle through the fabric at A again. Pull the needle and thread through from back to front.


Tighten the thread until it creates a flat vertical stitch at the back of the fabric, mirroring the one on the front.

, Cross the thread over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at a point lying even with B and to the left. This will be your C point.


The horizontal distance between B and C should roughly match the stitch width. In this example, it should be 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).
Continue pulling the needle and thread through to the back of the fabric until a flat diagonal stitch connecting A and C appears on the front of the fabric.

, Insert the needle through the fabric from back to front, bringing it through at a point vertically beneath C and to the horizontal left of A. This newest point is point D.


Pull the thread through completely, creating a flat vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from C to D.
With this step, you have completed a single zigzag stitch.

, Repeat the steps used to create the first stitch down the entire length of your stitch row. End the row with a vertical stitch.


Reset your stitch labels at the end of each complete zigzag stitch. In other words, the C point of your first zigzag becomes the B point of your second, and the D point of your first zigzag becomes the A point of your second.
For each stitch:

Stitch a vertical line between A and B on the front of the fabric.
Stitch a vertical line between B and A along the back, inserting the needle through to the front at A again.
Stitch diagonally across the front of the fabric from A to C.
Stitch a vertical line along the back of the fabric from C to D, inserting the needle through to the front at D.


End the row with a vertical stitch across the front of the fabric between the D and C of your final zigzag.
Make sure that you maintain the same stitch width and length for each zigzag.

, Rename your stitch labels so that E is the bottom of your last vertical stitch and F is the top point of that same stitch. Cross over this final vertical stitch so that the needle comes out to the front of the fabric at E.


If done correctly, the stitch prior to this should have gone through to the back of the fabric at F.
To complete this step, make a vertical stitch along the back of the fabric from F to E, inserting the needle through E.

, Cross over the front of the fabric and insert the needle at the top point of the adjacent vertical stitch, now identified as point G. Pull the thread through to create a flat diagonal stitch.


This newest diagonal stitch should cross over the center of the last diagonal stitch made during your first trip down the length of the row. The resulting stitch will be x-shaped.
Note that G lies to the horizontal right of F.

, Insert the needle through to the front of the fabric at the bottom point of the current vertical post you're resting on. This point can now be referred to as point H.


Point H is directly beneath point G and to the right of E.

, Zigzag your stitches down the length of the row, working from the left edge to the right edge. End by overlapping the very first vertical post you made.


These stitches should be nearly identical to the ones you created down the first pass, but they will slant in the opposite direction (left to right instead of right to left).
For each stitch:

Stitch a vertical line between E and F on the front of the fabric, overlapping the vertical post already there.
Stitch between F and E along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at E again.
Stitch diagonally across the front from E to G.
Stitch between G and H along the back of the fabric, inserting through to the front at H.


The end of the row should conclude with a vertical stitch between your final H and G points.

, If done correctly, the needle and thread should be at the back of your fabric. Knot the thread here and cut off any excess thread to complete the zigzag row.


To knot the thread:

Bring the needle through the front and back of the fabric at a spot directly next to your current insertion point.
Before drawing the thread flat, insert the needle through the loop you just created. Do so two or three times, then draw the loop closed. This should create a secure knot.

Knot the thread at the back of the fabric.",How to Do a Zigzag Stitch by Hand2," Insert the needle through the fabric from back to front. Begin at the bottom left edge of your intended stitch line, point A.


Pull the needle and thread completely through until the end knot lies flat against the back of the fabric.

, Insert the needle through the front of the fabric at a point directly on top of A, point AA.


As you look at the front of the fabric, A and AA should look like the same point. There needs to be a few threads separating them to prevent the stitch from falling out, though.
Do not pull the needle and thread through this point yet. Only insert the tip of the needle for now.

, Slide the tip of the needle along the back of the fabric at a 45 degree angle. Insert it through the front of the fabric at a point lying to the upward diagonal left of AA. This new point will be point B.


The space between AA and B will determine the width of your stitches. Unless otherwise noted, distance of 1/8 inch (3.175 mm) is usually a good choice.
Do not pull the needle and thread completely through AA or B yet.

, Use your fingers to position the thread leading into AA underneath the tip of the needle coming out at B.A little line of thread should run parallel to the needle on its left side. The rest should be tucked beneath the needle, extending down from the needle's right side.

, Pull the needle and thread completely through to the front of the fabric again. Doing so should tighten the loop created in the previous step.


The needle should now be free and lying along the front of the fabric.
Note that the point of the loop comes together at A and AA. The rounded portion of the loop should lie to the immediate outside of B, and the thread should be coming out at B to the inside of the loop.

, Insert the needle through the fabric at a point that overlaps B. Label this point BB.


As with A and AA, B and BB should only have a few threads separating them.
Only insert the tip of the needle. Do not pull the entire needle through to the back of the fabric.

, Poke the tip of the needle back through to the front of the fabric at a 45 degree downward slant, bringing it out at point C.


Point C should be horizontally even with A and AA.
Do not pull the needle completely through BB or C yet.

, Create another chain link using the same procedure followed for the first chain. Your two chains should form one zigzag.


Slide the thread underneath the tip of the needle coming out at BB, creating a wide loop in the process.
Pull the needle and thread completely through to the front of the fabric, tightening the loop you just created.

, Continue making chains across the length of the row until you reach the end. Each chain should slant in the direction opposite the slant of the chain before and after it.


Each chain stitch should be slanted at a 45 degree angle.

, Once you reach the end of the stitch row, insert the needle into the front of the fabric and out through the back. Tie a knot at the back of the fabric.


To knot the thread:

Insert the needle through the front and back of the fabric at a point directly next to your final insertion point.
Before you draw the thread flat, draw the needle through the newly created loop two or three times.
Draw the loop closed to create a secure knot.

Leave some excess thread.,
Avoid sewing on top of other fabrics.,
Turn the garment so that the backside is facing you.,
Make a loop.,
Use the needle to make a knot.,
Remove the excess thread.",How to End a Stitch," Try to leave at least three inches of extra thread so that you can successfully secure a stitch without losing the end of the thread.






;
, Keep the garment on a flat surface (like a table) so that you don’t stitch into another layer of fabric, such as your own clothing.








, You should also be able to see the length of the nearby stitch you just made.








, Insert the needle under the nearby stitch and pull it under the stitch until it forms a loop.









Note: For single or double thread you can alternatively make a loop with only the string itself. Holding the thread in one hand and the needle in the other, loop the thread over the needle and pull the needle through the loop. Then slowly pull the loop down until it is flush with the fabric and tighten it. This will make a knot., Slowly pull the needle through the loop and pull it tight. This will cause the beginning of a knot.









Note: With double thread, you can also take the thread out of the needle (leaving you with both strands of thread hanging from the back of the fabric) and fold the left side of the thread over and back under the right side several times like you are tying your shoes (just the first step of shoe-tying, not the loop parts).
Repeat this step several times to ensure the knot is secure.

, Cut the extra thread on the outside of the knot so the back of the fabric looks clean and uncluttered. Use very sharp scissors.

Match the thread to the color of the sequin rather than to the fabric.;
,, Draw it through the center of the sequin. Leave a long tail of thread on the underside.

, Cross the thread over the top of the sequin.

,, The more that you sew, the faster this will become as you get used to the rhythm of going through the motions.


When sewing sequins in a row, be sure that they're not overlapping unless this is the final look you wish to achieve.

Trace a line onto the fabric.,
Mount the fabric in an embroidery hoop.,
Thread the embroidery needle.",How to Do a Split Stitch1," Use an embroidery transfer pen to lightly trace the line you plan to embroider onto the fabric.


If you're only practicing the stitch and not following a pattern, you might find it easier to start practicing with straight lines.
Once you feel comfortable working with straight lines, draw some curved lines and shapes. The split stitch and split backstitch are both relatively easy to navigate around curves.

, Place your fabric in an embroidery hoop, centering the line you traced so that it falls in the middle of the hoop.


Place the fabric over the inner ring of the hoop.
Press the outer ring down, over the fabric and the inner ring.
Smooth out all the wrinkles and creases in your fabric.
Tighten the screw on your embroidery hoop. This should secure the fabric in place, making it ready for embroidery work.

, Insert the embroidery floss through the eye of your embroidery needle. Knot the tail end of the floss.


Choose six strand floss when you're starting out with the split stitch and split backstitch. You should be able to separate the floss evenly as you split each stitch, keeping three stitches on both sides of the needle.

Repeat down the line.,
Knot the end of the thread.",How to Do a Split Stitch2," Point the needle at the back of your fabric, positioning it just below the start of your line. Insert the needle into the fabric and draw it through to the top.


This will be the A point of your stitch.
Draw the needle and thread completely through the A point. Continue drawing it through until the knot at the tail of your embroidery floss hits the back of the fabric, preventing the floss from moving further.;
, Point the needle at a position a little further down the line. Only poke the tip of the needle through this point/


This will be the B point of your stitch.
Do not draw the needle completely through the B point. No more than one-third to one-half of the needle should poke through to the bottom of the fabric.

, Slide the tip of the needle along the back of the fabric. Insert the tip back through to the top of the fabric at a point along the line that lies halfway between A and B.


This is the C point of the stitch.
Do not draw the entire needle through the C point yet.

, Slide the tip of the needle along the front of the fabric and through the floss coming out at A. Draw the needle and thread completely through this position.Split the thread evenly. When using six-strand floss, there should be three strands on each side of the needle.
Draw the needle and thread completely through the fabric until the thread lies flat after splitting the stitch.
This step completes one split stitch.

, Point the needle at a position further down the line. Insert the tip of the needle into fabric at this point.


This will be your D point.
This step start a second split stitch.
Note that the distance between C and D should be roughly the same as the distance between A and B.

, Slide the needle along the back of the fabric, poking it out at the front of the fabric at a point halfway along your first stitch.


Make sure that the needle splits the thread of the first stitch evenly as you poke it back through to the top of the fabric.
Once the stitch is split, you should pull the needle and thread completely through to the top of the fabric, stopping once the thread lies flat.
This step completes a second split stitch.

, Each remaining split stitch will need to be made using the same technique practiced on the second split stitch.


Poke the needle into the fabric at a place further down the line.
Insert the needle back through the top of the fabric at the halfway point of your previous stitch, splitting the previous stitch in the process.
Draw the needle and thread through until the thread lies flat against the fabric.

, When you finish split stitching down the line, draw the thread through to the back of the fabric. Tie a small knot to secure the stitches.


Instead of tying a knot, you could weave the ends of your embroidery floss through some of the previous stitching to secure it.

This is the A point of your stitch.
Draw the needle and thread through A completely, stopping only when the knot at the tail of the thread hits the back of the fabric.

, Point the needle at a position further down the line. Poke the needle into the fabric at this point, drawing it through completely.


This is the B point of your stitch.
Draw the needle and thread down to the back of your fabric, stopping only when the thread lies flat against the top of the fabric.

, Poke the tip of your needle into the back of the fabric and out through the front, positioning it past B and further down the line. Draw the thread through this point.


This is the C point of your stitch.
The distance between B and C should be roughly the same as the distance between A and B.
Draw the thread through this point until it lies flat against the back of the fabric.

, Point the needle down toward the inside of B. Poke it through to the back of the fabric, splitting the stitch as you do.The needle should split the stitch created between A and B.
Make sure that there are an even number of strands on either side of the needle. For six-strand floss, there should be three strands of floss on each side.
The needle needs to be inserted near or directly through B.
Draw the thread through this point until the stitch lies flat against the fabric.
This step completes your first split backstitch.

, Poke the needle through to the front of the fabric at a point further down the line. Draw the thread completely through to the front.


This is point D.
The distance between C and D should be the same as the distance between B and C.
This step starts a second split backstitch.

, Position the needle to the inside of C and pierce it through both the stitch and the fabric. Draw the needle and thread all the way through to the back of the fabric.


Make sure that the stitch in between B and C is evenly split by your needle in this step.
The needle should be positioned next to or directly through C.
This step completes a second split backstitch.

, The rest of your split backstitches should be completed using the same technique applied to your second split backstitch.


Poke the needle through to the front of the fabric further down the line.

Decide how you will sew your hem.,
Fold your hem.,
Pin the hem in place.,
Sew your hem.,
Iron the hem.",How to Sew a Hem1," There are two ways to sew a hem: by hand or with a sewing machine. While the latter is obviously faster, the former allows you to sew a hem without many tools. If you can, set up your sewing machine for your hem; use a straight stitch for a double-fold hem.;
, Lay out your clothing on a countertop pattern-side down, with the hem/edge in front of you. Fold the fabric edge up ⅝-inch, and use an iron to flatten it out. Then, starting from the edge, create a second fold over the first ⅝-inch wide, so that the raw edge of the first fold is hidden under the second fold.









⅝-inch is the standard seam allowance, but you can use whatever measurement you want for your hem.

, Use multiple straight pins to secure this fold. Insert the pins so that the blunt end (often with a pearl) sticks out from the hem, while the needle-end of the pin is inserted towards the fabric. This will make them much easier to remove as you sew (if you’re using a sewing machine).








, Either with your sewing machine or by hand, use a matching thread to your fabric and sew a straight stitch along the top edge of the fold. Work all the way around until you’ve sewn the whole hem, and then tie off and cut your thread.








, You’re almost done! To finish off your hem, you need to iron it so it lays down flat. If your fabric can handle it, use a bit of steam to help with the ironing process. When you’re done ironing, turn your fabric right-side-out, and enjoy your newly completed hem."

Determine if you have the necessary tools.,
Prepare your fabric.,
Fold your hem.,
Pin the hem in place.,
Sew the hem.,
Finish your hem.",How to Sew a Hem2," Although you can hand-sew a blind hem, it can be very difficult and the process is much easier on a sewing machine. In order to sew a blind hem on a sewing machine, you must have two tools: a blind hem foot, and the proper stitch. A blind hem foot can be purchased at most sewing shops for around $10. In addition, check to see if your sewing machine comes with a stitch that looks like this: ^----^----^.

, If you haven’t already, prewash your fabric to prevent it from shrinking later. Then, place your fabric on a countertop with the pattern side down.

, Determine your seam allowance, as this is the width of the fold you will be making; a traditional seam allowance is ⅝-inch. Fold this much of the fabric up from the edge, and then do it again. This will hide the raw edge under fold, so that it won’t be seen in the finished hem. Use an iron to flatten this fabric out.








, Use a series of straight pins to hold the fabric in place. Insert the pins so that the blunt/pearl end is on the fabric portion, while the needle/tip is sticking out towards the edge of the hem.









If you are using a sewing machine, fold your ironed section under the fabric. Take the portion of fabric that you just folded/ironed, and fold it in the opposite direction so that it is hidden under the fabric. However, fold it so that about ⅛ of an inch is exposed. Your piece of fabric should now have the pattern-side down, but the tiny ⅛-inch exposed fold at the edge will show the fabric.

,









For hand sewing, start at the edge of your fold. Just above the fold, pick up a very small portion of the fabric. Then go left about 1/4 in and pick up a bit of the fold. Right above that, pick up a very small portion of the fabric again. Continue in this manner until you reach the end of your hem.
For a sewing machine, change your stitch to the one that looks like ‘--^----^--’. Turn your fabric sideways on the sewing machine, so that the ⅛-inch fold is on the right side, and the rest of the fabric is on the left. Begin sewing down the edge where the fold and the rest of the fabric meet. You should keep the edge of the fabric plumb to the divider on your presser foot. Sew like this all the way down the hem, until you reach the end of your fabric. You should notice that the ‘^’ stitches will hook onto the body of the fabric, while the regular straight stitches in between remain on the ⅛-inch folded portion.

, Tie and cut off the excess thread, and then unfold your hem. On one side (the back) you should see the hem sewn with the ‘--^----^--’ pattern. However, on the other side the stitch should be ‘blind’, as in you’ll only see a tiny dot where the ‘^’ stitch hooked onto the fabric. If this is the case, use an iron to flatten out the hem, and complete your sewing project.

Remove the seam from the existing hem.,
Try on the garment (right side out) in front of a full-length mirror and decide on a desired length for the hem.,
Remove the garment and mark the desired hemline around the leg or skirt.,
Decide how deep you want your hem, and mark a line that distance above and below the hemline.,
Trim the raw edge, leaving about 1 inch below your lowest line.,
Fold the raw edge in and press with an iron.,
Tuck the fabric under along the middle line so that it now forms the hemline.,

Set the machine to the blind hem stitch setting.,
Turn the fabric wrong side up (inside out, in other words) and position it on the sewing machine.,
Stitch slowly.,
Inspect your work.,
Remove the pins and press the hem.",How to Blind Hem Stitch," You can do this with a seam ripper or small nail scissors. Or, if the garment is much longer than desired, you can cut off the bottom with fabric scissors.


Don't make the garment too short, though! Leave several inches to prepare your blind hem.;
,


Stand on a stool or table and ask a friend to put a few pins at the correct level.

, Remove the pins.


Use water-soluble pencil, pen, or chalk.
Alternatively, you can mark the hemline with pins.

, For example, if you want a 2-inch deep hem, you mark a line 2 inches above and 2 inches below the hemline.


Again, you can use a water-soluble pen or pencil, or do this with pins.

, Be certain to leave an inch of fabric!

, If you have 1 inch of raw edge, tuck 1/2 inch of fabric under, leaving the remaining 1/2 inch under your bottom line.


Some experts suggest sewing this fold with a basic straight stitch or finishing the raw edge with an over edge or zigzag stitch, but this may not be an essential step., Do this by pinching the fabric at the middle line (what's to be your final hemline). Your other two lines (above and below the hemline) should line up, since they are equidistant from the hem. Pin around the hem to hold this fold in place.

, At this point, your bottom line will once again be exposed, and below it the pressed raw edge.


You can remove the previous pins and use them to secure the folds.

, After you've done this, you can remove the pins if you wish, but it isn't necessary., The sewing machine requires a specific foot for this stitch, with the vertical bar passing between the two feet.


Alternatively, buy a universal blind hem presser foot for your machine in a sewing shop or online. These feet are fairly inexpensive and a good choice if your machine does not have the blind hem presser foot.Make sure, however, that it fits your machine. Check the product specifications before buying: they'll usually say which machines it works with.
If you can't find a presser foot for your machine, you can still make this hem! Skip to sewing instructions in Part 3, Step 2.

, Follow the instructions for your particular machine.

, This setting is often indicated by two stitches spaced far apart, but check your user's manual to be sure. Now you're ready to sew!, Make sure the foot's vertical plate is sitting right on top of the fold. The machine is going to stitch along the raw edge section mostly, but cross the plate into the fold every few stitches.

, Hold the fabric carefully so that the fold stays just under the vertical plate. This way the needle is sure to catch it.If you do not have a blind hem presser foot, make the stitch pattern manually:


Put the machine feed dogs on the inside.
Place your fabric on the machine as in Step 1.
Make five straight stitches, and then one stitch to barely catch the fold.
Continue around the hem.

, Remove the garment, snip the thread, and turn right side out. Check for any missed stitches.


If needed, go back and redo the sections where there is a missing stitch.

, If a line remains from the previous hemline, try spritzing it with a bit of distilled water and ironing. If this doesn't work, it will probably come out when laundered."

,,, Push it through one of the button-holes, making sure to pull the thread all the way through until the knot catches on the fabric.

,,,, Going through each hole 3 times should be sufficient. For larger buttons, more passes may be needed.

, Pull the thread completely through, without going through any of the holes of the fabric itself.

,,, Congratulations, you have successfully sewn a button!

"
Iron or pre-wash your fabric.,
Thread the needle.",How to Sew1," If your fabric is prone to shrinking, you'll be thankful you did. Do this well before you start sewing -- the fabric needs to be completely dry.









Follow the washing instructions for that specific fabric. Whether it's machine wash, hand wash, or hang dry, the instructions should be followed.
If you throw your fabric in the dryer and it comes out a little wrinkly, iron it. It'll be much easier to work with when you're sewing. 
;
, When it comes to thread, more is better. Aim for cutting twice as much thread as you think you'll actually need. Taking one end of the thread between your thumb and forefinger, insert it through the eye of the needle. Then, bring the needle to the halfway point by bringing both ends of the thread together. Once there, secure the ends in a knot.









Cutting the thread with sharp scissors and licking the end can make it easier to guide through the eye of the needle. If you can't do it, your thread may be too thick or your needle too small.

Pierce the needle through the wrong side of the fabric.,
Pierce the needle through the right side of the fabric.,
Repeat the previous two steps.,
End by piercing the right side.",How to Sew2," That is, pierce it through the side that people won't be seeing. Pull it out and through (you may need a bit of force), followed by the thread, all the way until it's stopped by the knot. If your knot goes through, simply make a bigger one.









The reason you start on the wrong side is so that this knot doesn't end up on the right side (the visible part) of a garment or fabric.
If the knot slips right through the fabric, there might be a few reasons for this:

You might need to make a bigger knot
Your needle might be too big, creating a hole in the fabric that's the same size or bigger than the knot, allowing the knot to pass through
You might be yanking the thread too hard when the knot meets the fabric




, Close to where you pierced your material initially, push the needle back through to the wrong side. Pull the entire length of thread and keep pulling until you feel resistance. You just made your first stitch on the right side! Congratulations! It looks like a little hyphen, right?









The stitch should be tight enough to lay flat on the fabric, but not so tight that it makes the fabric bunch underneath it.

, Always keeping close to your last stitch, pierce through the wrong side again. Pull all the thread out and voila -- your second stitch. Continue doing this, making sure each stitch is the same length as the one before.









Generally, the stitches should be in a straight line, like a less computerized version of this:
- - - - - -

This stitch, with the wide intervals between each bit of thread, is called the basting stitch. This is generally used to hold fabrics together or to gather pieces of fabric.




, You're finished! The needle and thread should now be on the wrong side, where you can finish 'er off with another knot. Get it as close to your material as possible -- otherwise your stitches will move around and stretch out.









There is an alternative, however. You could push the needle to the correct side, but leave it loose. You want a loop on the wrong side. Then, put the needle through to the wrong side again, once more close to the piercing you just made. Pull it tight so there's no loop on that side, but keeping the original loop intact. Now, pass the needle through the loop and tighten all the way, undoing the loop. The loop serves to secure the thread to the fabric. Pass it through twice for good measure.

"
"
Practice a closer stitch.,
Start zig-zag stitching.,
Sew two pieces of fabric together.,
Patch a hole.",How to Sew3," The basting stitch, as described above, is good for a start. However, the bigger the stitches, the more likely it is to tear or come out.









The basting stitch has a long stitch length -- sturdier stitches have medium or short stitch lengths. When piercing through the right side to the wrong side of your fabric, the next pierce should be as close to the former stitch as possible.

, This is a stitch that goes back and forth and is used when a straight stitch just won't do, like to reinforce buttonholes or in working with stretchable fabrics. It can also be used to temporarily join two pieces together at their edges. It looks just like a zigzag (hence the name) and comes in short, medium, and long stitch lengths, too.









A blind stitch is a variant of the zigzag stitch. It is also called a ""blind hem."" It is very similar to the zig-zag stitch, but it includes several straight, run-of-the-mill stitches. It's used to create an invisible hem; this is accomplished because only the zig-zags make it through to the right side of the material. With a reduced number comes reduced visibility., If you're upgrading to this step, put your fabric together so that their wrong sides face outwards (and their right sides are together). Line up the edges along which you want to join them. Sew in a line that follows the edges.









Once you're done, pull the pieces apart. They'll be held together at the seam you just sewed, but the thread will be barely visible. A better way to do this, however, is by slip stitching.

, Sewing a rip or tear isn't too difficult. Just pinch the edges of the hole together, towards the inside (the wrong side). Sew the edges together in a seam. Use a short stitch length (no space between the stitches) to keep it from breaking open.

Wash and iron the fabrics before sewing them together.,Stack the fabrics

,
Pin or baste the fabrics together.,
Using a basic stitch, sew the fabrics together and remove the pins or basting.

,
Hang the two ends of the fabric down.,
Pin or baste the two ends of the fabric to the smaller piece of fabric that you are using to extend the length.

,
Do a second basic stitch with as much accuracy as possible because this stitch will be visible.,
Remove the baste or pins and trim the excess fabric at least 1/4"" or 1/3"" away from the stitches.

",How to Join Two Materials Together,";
,, With most sewing projects, the actual time sewing is very little, and it is the preparation of the materials before sewing that takes time. When working with a supple fabric(s), pin the fabrics together before hand basting them. Hand baste for more precise sewing. Basting with just pins is fast, but is cumbersome to work with all those pins when doing the permanent machine stitch.

,, In the drawing, the project is extending the length to a pants. Hang the fabric ends down and not up. Iron it.

,, Make this stitch parallel to the other line and with an equal distance between the stitches. Enlist a helper to hold the material in this crucial phase of sewing.

Sew straight across the raw edge.,
Fold in the raw edge.,
Pick up a few threads with your sewing needle.,
Make a few more stitches in the same manner.,
Pull the thread through.,
Repeat along the length of the hem.,
Iron press when finished.",How to Hem Chiffon1," Thread your needle with matching, lightweight thread, and sew straight across your hem roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) away from the raw edge.


After sewing this line, trim the edge so that there is only 1/8 inch (3 mm) between the thread line and the raw edge.
This stitch will end up being on the bottom of your hem. It should help you maintain an even, consistent roll.;
, Fold the raw edge toward the wrong side of the fabric. Press in place using an iron.


While not entirely necessary, pressing the fold in place will make the hem less likely to unroll as you stitch it in place.
Fold the fabric so that the bend falls just past your initial row of stitching. You should see your initial stitching along the underside of the fabric and not from the front.

, Pick up one thread from the fabric and a small stitch from the edge of your fold. Pull the needle through, but do not pull it taut yet.Use a small, sharp needle for best results. Doing so will make it easier to pick up single threads along your hem.
The stitch made into your fold should be as close to the actual fold as possible. Position it in between your initial line of stitching and the fold itself.
The threads you pick up from the front of the actual fabric should be directly above the stitch made into your fold. These threads should also be right above the raw edge.
Make sure that you only pick up one or two threads from the fabric. Picking up more will cause the hem to be more visible from the front of the fabric.

, Each stitch should only pick up one or two threads from the fabric, and the stitches should be spaced roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) apart.


Repeat this until you have 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of hem stitching.

, Lightly pull on the thread in the direction of your stitching. The raw edge should roll itself down into your hem, disappearing from sight.


Use firm pressure, but do not pull tightly. Pulling too tightly can cause the fabric to bunch up.
Smooth out any bubbles or bumps with your fingers.

, Continue stitching along the rest of the hem in the same manner until you reach the end. Knot off the end and cut off any excess thread.


As you get better at the process, you can pull the thread after 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) of stitching rather than every 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm).
If completed correctly, the raw edge should be hidden along the wrong side of the fabric and the hem stitching should be barely visible from the front.

, The hem may already be smooth enough, but if desired, use an iron to press it further.


This step completes the process.

"
"
Sew a basting line around the raw edge.,
Fold and press.,
Sew to the inside of the folded edge.,
Trim back the raw edge.,
Fold over the hemline.,
Sew through the center of the rolled hem.,
Press the hem.",How to Hem Chiffon2," Use your sewing machine to sew an even line 1/4 inch (6 mm) in from the raw edge of your chiffon.This line will give you a guide, making the hem easier to fold. It also eases the edge in a bit, making it tighter and easier to fold under later on.
Consider increasing the thread tension by one place further than necessary for this basting line. Restore the setting to normal once this line is complete.

, Turn the raw edge in toward the wrong side of the material, folding it along the basting line. Press it in place with a hot iron.


Holding the fabric somewhat taut along the basting line can help you fold the edge while pressing it in place.
Move the iron up and down, rather than moving it side to side, to prevent the material from stretching or shifting as you press it.
Use plenty of steam as you press the fold in place.

, Use your sewing machine to sew another line around the edge of the chiffon. This one should be 1/8 inch (3 mm) in from the folded edge.


This line of stitches will act as another guide, making it easier to fold in the hem once more.

, Use sharp scissors to trim back the raw edge as close to the new sewing line you just created in the previous step.


Make sure that you do not cut beneath or into the stitches as you complete this step.

, Turn the material in toward the wrong side again, just enough to fold the raw edge under. Press this fold in place with an iron.


The second line of stitching you made should be folded in during this step. Your initial line of stitching will still be visible.

, Slowly stitch around the hem, working along the edge of your hemline, until you reach the end of the hem.


You should have to visible lines of stitches from the back and one visible line from the front.
You can either use a straight stitch or an edgestitch for this step.
Do not back tack your hem in place. Leave enough thread at the beginning and end of the seam to knot it by hand., Iron the hem one last time to flatten it out as much as possible.


This step completes the process.

"
"
Attach a rolled hem presser foot to your machine.,
Sew a small line of basting stitches.Lower the presser foot onto the material without feeding the material into the guide.,
Feed the edge of the material into the presser foot.,
Sew along the hem.,
Press in place.",How to Hem Chiffon3," Follow the instructions provided with your sewing machine to change out the presser foot, replacing the standard one with a special rolled hem presser foot.


Choose your rolled hem presser foot carefully if you do not already own one. The best and most versatile kind will allow you to make rolled hems using a straight stitch, zig zag stitch, or decorative stitch. For this project alone, however, you only need one that will allow you to make a standard straight stitch.

, Sew a line of standard stitches 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) long, 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the raw edge.


Leave long tails of thread after stitching this line. Both the line of stitches and the attached threads will help you guide the fabric into the presser foot.
Do not fold your fabric in yet during this step.
Stitch along the wrong side of the material.

, Note the guide along the front of your special presser foot. Feed the edge of your material into this guide, bending the raw edge over from one side and under the opposite side.


Keep the presser foot lifted as you feed the material in, then lower the presser foot when finished.
Feeding the material into the presser foot can be difficult. Use the threads attached to your small set of basting stitches to help lift, guide, and maneuver the edge into the presser foot.

, With the edge guided into the presser foot and the presser foot lowered onto the fabric, sew slowly and carefully along the entire edge of the chiffon, stopping only once you reach the end.


If the edge has been fed into the presser foot guide correctly, the presser foot should continue to roll it under as you work. No further effort on your part should be required.
Using your right hand, hold the remaining raw edge taut as you sew, allowing it to feed into the presser foot evenly.
Work slowly and carefully to prevent bubbles or bumps from forming. When finished, your hemmed edge should be smooth.
Do not back tack the material in place. Instead, leave a long tail of thread at the start and end of the seam and knot the thread in place by hand.
You will only see one line of stitching from both the front and back of the material.

, Once your hem is finished, take the chiffon to an iron and gently press it down, flattening the fold as much as possible.


This step should complete the process.

"
"
Determine how large your hem should be.,
Fold the material over once.,
Fold the material over a second time.,
Sew along the folded edge.,
Tidy up the hem.,
Inspect the hem.",How to Hem1," Figure out how much material you want to hem up from the bottom of the cloth.


Typically speaking, you should err on the side of hemming too little rather than hemming too much, since the latter option can make the bottom of your material seem too bulky.
If you need to hem up more than 2 inches (5 cm) or so, consider trimming away some of the excess material before hemming it.;
, With the fabric inside-out, fold the material up by half your total hem measurement. Carefully iron the crease to press it flat.


The wrong sides of the fabric should be together after this fold.
If your total hem width needs to be 1 inch (2.5 cm), then this fold should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide.

, Fold the up another width of material from the bottom of your material, working in the same direction as your original hem. The amount of material you fold up in this step should equal the amount folded up in your previous step.


Pin this fold in place with straight pins and press the fold with a hot iron.
For a 1 inch (2.5 cm) hem, both this fold and the previous fold should use 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of material.
The raw edge of your material should be hidden under this second fold.

, Transfer the pinned hem to your sewing machine. Sew a straight line across the entire hem, positioning it roughly 1/8 inch (3 mm) away from the top folded edge.


You should also consider backstitching one or two stitches at the beginning and end of the hem to secure the threads.
Pull out the pins as you work. Do not sew over them.
If you're sewing by hand instead of using a sewing machine, backstitch across the entire hem, roughly 1/8 inch (3 mm) away from the top folded edge.

, Trim any loose threads. If necessary, re-iron the crease of the hem flat again.

, Make sure that the material is even all the way around your hem and that the hem is securely stitched in place around the entire perimeter.


Turn the project right-side out again when done.
This completes the process.

"
"
Mark out your folds.,
Turn the raw edge under.,
Fold the fabric along your hemline.,
Fold upward.,
Attach a blind hem presser foot to your sewing machine.,
Set your sewing machine to a blind hem stitch.,
Stitch across your hem.,
Check your hem.",How to Hem2," Figure out how wide you want your hem to be. Then, use a water soluble fabric pencil to mark each fold you'll need to make for your hem.


Keep the material right-side out as you work.
Measure your desired hem width from the bottom of the fabric. Mark this distance on your material, then draw a line parallel to the bottom of the material all around the perimeter of the fabric at this width. This line will end up being your middle line, and it will also serve as your final hemline.
Draw two more lines. One should be below your first line and the second should be above it. Both lines should also be an equal distance away from center line. The distance between your lines will be the thickness of your hem. Usually, 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) is a good thickness.
Trim away the raw edge, if necessary. You should only have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of material or less below the bottom line.

, Fold the raw edge to the underside of the fabric, bringing the edge to the imaginary backside of your bottom line. Use an iron to press this fold in place.


If you have 1 inch (2.5 cm) of material below your bottom line, you will turn the raw edge under by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).

, Pinch along the top and bottom of your center line, folding the fabric directly on the line itself. Fold the bottom portion of material under all the way around the perimeter of the hem.


The imaginary backside of the bottom line should match the imaginary backside of the top line as you fold.
The original center line should rest at the bottom of the hem when finished.
Pin the hem in place.

, Fold the material along the top line so that this top line now lies in your new crease. Bring the bottom of your material up and over the front of the fabric as you fold.


Remove your previous set of pins and re-insert them into the fabric to hold the newest fold in place.
Lightly press the folds with an iron to help secure them further. You can remove the pins when finished or leave them in for extra security.

, Note that a standard presser foot will not work for this hem.


Follow the instructions provided with your sewing machine to figure out how to attach the blind hem presser foot.

, This setting is usually indicated graphically by a set of alternating peaks and straight lines.


Check your sewing machine's instructions to learn how to set the stitch and to verify which stitch is the correct choice.
You may need to readjust the stitch width, as well. A setting of 3.5 or so is usually a good option for medium-weight fabric.

, Fold the material inside-out and transfer it to your sewing machine. Stitch slowly across the hem, continuing until you make your way around the entire perimeter.


The vertical plate of the presser foot should sit along the fold
As the machine runs, it will stitch across the plate every few stitches, taking a small amount of material from the fold as it works.
Keep the fold directly against the plate the entire time.

, Look at the hem carefully to make sure that machine snagged the fold with each stitch. When everything looks good, remove the pins and turn your project right-side out again.


If you machine missed a few stitches, you may need to go back in and re-stitch that part.
Press the hem again to crease it further.
This step completes the process.

"
"
Measure the new hemline.,
Trim away the excess material.,
Change out the presser foot.,
Roll the hem under.,
Pierce the rolled hem with your sewing machine needle.,
Slowly stitch the first few stitches.,
Feed the raw edge into the presser foot as you continue.,
Check the hem.",How to Hem3," Figure out how much material you need to remove from the bottom of the material. With the piece inside-out, fold up the bottom to this desired length and pin the material in place.


The excess fabric should be brought to the underside of the project.
The fold of your hem should be positioned over your intended hemline.
You should also consider pressing the fold in place with a hot iron.

, You should only have about 1/4 inch (6 mm) of fabric between your fold and the raw edge. Cut off any excess using sharp scissors.


If a 1/4 inch (6 mm) thickness seems a little intimidating to work with, you can increase this amount to 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Do not make the material any thicker than that, however, or the hem will not turn out correctly.

, You will need to attach a rolled hem presser foot to your sewing machine to create this hem. A standard presser foot will not work.


The exact steps you'll need to follow when changing out the presser foot can vary by machine, so check your model's instructions.

, Using your fingers, roll a small hem along the bottom of the raw edge, rolling the material inward toward the fold so that the raw edge is hidden.


The hem needs to be about 1/8 inch (3 mm) wide if you left 1/4 inch (6 mm) of material, or 1/4 inch (6 mm) wide if you left 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of material.

, While still pinching the rolled hem in place with your fingers, carefully transfer the material to your sewing machine. Lower the needle into the rolled portion of your hem to secure it in place.

, Run the machine, stitching five to seven stitches along your hem.


At this point, you only need to stitch enough of the hem in place to get it started.

, Use your fingers to carefully feed the raw edge of your material into the curly-cue at the front of your presser foot. Continue sewing along the hem, gently coaxing the fabric into the curlycue of the presser foot as you work.


The presser foot itself will guide the material for the most part, drawing it in and rolling it under as you work. As such, you should not need to roll the rest of the bottom edge by hand.
The raw edge of your material should run parallel with the edge of the presser foot and on the left. The fold should run parallel on to the right.

, Once finished, check your hem to make sure that the entire bottom has been rolled and stitched in place. Re-stitch any incomplete section, then turn the fabric right-side out again.


This step should complete the process.

"
"
Press a strip of bias tape open.,
Pin the bias tape to the fabric.,
Stitch the tape in place.,
Fold the rest of the bias tape over.,
Sew the tape onto the material.,
Check your hem.",How to Hem4," Unfold a length of double-fold bias tape long enough to cover the perimeter of your hem. Use a hot iron to press the smaller fold of the bias tape open.


Use just enough heat and pressure to hold the tape open. Don't use too much, though, since you could accidentally lose the crease of the tape.
Note that this hem style works well if you are trying to hem the raw edge of a project without sacrificing any length.

, With the fabric right-side up, place the bias tape right-side down along the lower edge. Make sure that the raw edge of the bias tape matches the raw edge of the fabric.

, Sew the tape and fabric together, stitching straight across the bottom crease of the tape.

, Bring the rest of the bias tape down and over the raw edge of the fabric. The raw edge should be hidden inside of another fold in the tape, and the remaining fold of the tape should be positioned against the wrong side of the fabric.


Pin or press the bias tape in place after folding it over.
No raw edges should be visible. This goes for both the fabric and the bias tape.

, Flip the material over to its right side. Using a sewing machine, sew a straight stitch all the way across your hem, in the ditch where the fabric and bias tape meet.


This step should secure the back of the tape to the back of the fabric.
When done right, you should see very little visible stitching from the front of the fabric, but the stitches will be evident along the back.

, Inspect the hem, making sure that the bias tape has been stitched on evenly across the entire bottom.


Re-stitch any section that got missed.
The completion of this step completes the process.

"
"
Fold the hem along the underside of the fabric.,
Place the hem tape in between your layers.,
Cover the hemming area with a damp cloth.,
Briefly iron a portion of the hem over the cloth.,
Iron around the rest of the hem.,
Check the hem when the material is dry and cool.",How to Hem5," Turn the garment inside-out and fold the bottom of the material up, facing you. Pin the material and press the fold in place using an iron.


Figure out your desired hem length before you secure the fold. For this hem, the amount of material you want to remove from the bottom of the fabric will be the amount of material you need to fold up.
Quickly iron the fold in the material with a hot iron to help hold it in place. Doing so will minimize how much the fabric moves around as you work on the hem.

, Your hem tape should be placed around the entire perimeter of your hem. Pin in place using straight pins.


If the hem tape has a double-sided adhesive, place the tape underneath the opening of your folded fabric, in between the hemmed fabric and the back side of your main fabric. Double-sided hem tape should be hidden between both layers of cloth.
If the hem tape only has adhesive on one side, place it adhesive-side down around the opening of your folded material. Half the tape should be on the hemmed material, while the other half should extend onto the back side of the main fabric.

, Rinse a rag under lukewarm water and wring out the excess moisture. Place this rag over the area you plan on hemming.

, Place your hot iron directly onto the damp rag. Hold it there for several seconds, then remove the iron and the cloth.


Make sure that the area you press is part of the area you need to hem.
The purpose of this step is to help secure a portion of the hem tape to the material. Let the material cool slightly, then gently tug on the ironed area. The adhesive should prevent the material from coming up when you tug on it.
After this step, you can remove the pins holding the tape in place. Do so carefully to avoid disturbing the position of the tape over the hem.

, Use your hot iron to adhere the rest of the tape onto the hemmed material. Work slowly and carefully, holding the iron over each section of tape for several seconds before moving onto the next area.


Note that you should iron directly over the material for this step. Do not use the damp rag you used initially.
Work around the entire hem until you feel certain that the tape has melted.

, When the material is both dry and cool to the touch, give the hem a gentle tug around the entire perimeter. It should remain securely fixed in place.


Turn the material right-side out when done.
This step completes the process.

Cut off the frayed edges.,
Sew up the tear.,
Cut all excess thread and remaining protruding material.,
Give your jeans a once-over with a clothes iron.",How to Fix Ripped Jeans1," Before you get to properly repairing your jeans, you'll first need to cut the excess threads, or frayed edges caused by the tear. Take some scissors and try to cut reasonably close; you want to get rid of any protrusions, but you also don't want to lose any material you can otherwise save. , Provided you haven't lost much material, you can usually mend smaller rips without using any patches. First, turn your jeans inside out; that way, when you sew, the new seams won't be as visible. Take a sewing needle and thread, and stitch back and forth until the rip is mended. Try to make the stitches as close as possible.


If it's available, try to use thread that's the same as the seam as the rest of the jeans. In many cases, this will be a white or black thread. If the rip is in a conspicuous place far away from natural seams, it's recommended you choose a colour that best fits your jeans' regular colour (usually blue or black).

, Once you get the rip sewn up, you can proceed to cut the extra bits off. Be sure to cut the sewing thread as close to the jean material as you can. If there are any frayed edges you didn't catch the first time around, give them a cut now. , Now that you've made the repair, you'll want to seal the jeans with an iron press. This will smooth out any creases and give your pants a fresh feeling of newness.

"
"
Recognize the distinction between tear types.,
Assess the damage and prepare thread.,
Closely sew the thread across the torn seam.,
Cut off any excess thread at the end.,
Iron the seam.",How to Fix Ripped Jeans2," Mending a torn seam should be approached differently than a regular tear; the fabric in seams is usually much more reinforced than the rest of the pant legs. While this can make it more challenging than stitching regular fabric together, mending a seam rip will look much better in the end; if done correctly, it'll be near-impossible to tell there was a problem to begin with!

, In the vast majority of cases, you'll find a torn seam is a few centimetres at most. Unless the tear is miniscule or much more significant, it is generally good form to cut a length of thread that's around the length of your arm. Seam stitches tend to be very tightly woven, and the thread will disappear faster than you might think. If you even up with excess at the end of mending, you ca always cut the extra thread off at the end.


Make sure to choose a thread that resembles the existing stitching as closely as possible. This doesn't always match up with the colour of the jeans themselves-- some denim brands tend to prefer golden thread. Choosing a close colour will make the repairs look harder to recognize.

, Hold the fabric and the broken seam together and slowly stitch them back together. It is highly recommended that you try to follow the pre-existing stitch pattern. The closer you're able to get to replicating that pattern, the harder it will be for anyone to detect there was a repair in the first place.


You'll need a stronger needle to penetrate the thicker seam fabric.

, Once you've sewn shut the extent of the tear, you should take some scissors and cut off any excess thread as close as you can.

, It's always good measure to iron out the seam once you're done with the sewing. This will smooth out any creases in the thread and help seal in your repairs.

"
Get a patch that suits the style of your jeans and size of the hole.,
Cut frayed edges.,
Turn your pants inside out.,
Sew the patch with close-knit seams.,
Iron your patch out.",How to Fix Ripped Jeans3," When it comes to bigger holes that cannot be mended with a single seam, your best bet is to look into getting a patch-- an extra piece of fabric you can integrate into your jeans to cover the hole. You can find patches at a local arts and crafts or clothing specialty outlet. Buy a patch that matches the colour of your jeans as closely as possible. You'll want to get a patch that's slightly bigger than the hole you're covering; that way, you'll have some extra room to make errors. While denim patches are the safest bet if you're looking to really repair your jeans, you can take the damage as an opportunity to stylize your jeans with brightly coloured or flannel patches. Adding a patch that will clearly stand out from the rest of the clothing will give it a down-to-earth flair. While denim (or 'masked' alterations) are best sewn in on the inside of the jeans, patching different fabrics to the outside of your jeans will make them more prominent and eye-catching. If you're feeling thrifty, you can harvest your own patches from jeans you don't use anymore.

, If you have a bigger hole that will require a patch, you should still cut off the frayed edges. Even if it sounds like you are consciously losing material, the frayed edges won't be any help in mending it, so it's best to get rid of them, leaving a clean hole. Take some scissors and cut excess threads around the hole. By the end, there shouldn't be any threads significantly sticking out. , With patches in particular, it's recommended you turn your jeans inside out while you're patching them. That way, the most visible seams won't be externally visible. It'll also give you a bit of extra room to make sewing mistakes.


It's typically better to sew a denim patch in from the inside. This will make the patch look less evident, as well as cover up the most visible stitch lines.

, Once you've got your jeans turned inside out, take a sewing needle and thread and sew the patch. Try to keep your sewing as close as possible; you want to integrate the fabric into your jeans as closely as closely as possible.

, Ironing your jeans following a patch is significantly more important than ironing a small tear. This will help even out and seal the patch.

Thread your needle.,
Bring your needle up from the back side.,
Point the needle downward and wrap the thread around the needle three times.,
Pull the strand through the doubled wrap and down through the fabric.,
Anchor the thread on the back.,
Finished.

",How to Do a French Knot," You can do this with one piece of thread that's about 12"" long (30 cm) or three separate strands of embroidery floss. If you're making a french knot in fabric, you may want a needle with a larger eye and thicker thread, or even yarn.


If you're using separate strands of floss, treat the tails of the floss separately – tie a knot near the end of one of the tails, but don't tie the others. Make the string with the knotted tail slightly longer than the other two. This strand will be the anchor of the knot; the other two will provide it bulk.;
, Draw the floss or thread through for the full length of the strand, bringing the knot to the edge of the material.


If you're using several strands of floss, the knot will draw the one strand tight and the loose tails will come through. This is how it's supposed to be.
If it is an embroidery type piece, you could also anchor the thread on the back of the piece by working it through a few stitches.

, Put the point of the needle back into the fabric just a thread or two away from the place it came up from on the back side. Then, pull the string tight around the base of the needle, forming the beginning of the knot.


To elaborate: Grab the thread with your left index and thumb (or right if you are left handed) about 2 inches (5 cm) from the fabric. Wrap the thread around the needle towards you – twice for a small knot, three or four times for a bigger one. Pull the string tight so it slides down the needle, where you can see the knot ready and waiting to form.
If you are working on a larger weave fabric such as aida cloth, you will want to go back in just slightly to one side of the original hole so you don't pull the knot through to the back.

, Point the needle back into the fabric where you came through initially. As you're pulling through, continue to hold the thread taut with your left hand with a slight loop held by your thumb so it doesn't tangle. The threads will then knot themselves into the right shape.


Keep the tension on the strand at all times – the knot should be starting to form before the needle is even through. If you've done it right, the double wrap will form a tight little ""bud"" at the point of insertion – the french knot.
Don't yank – you could undo all your hard work. Pull through slowly so your stands don't get into the wrong kind of tangled and knotted.

, This works better if you have the fabric sitting on a firm surface, such as a book or magazine, rather than poking the needle into your knee. If you'd like to create more knots, you can either tie them off or anchor them in existing stitches. Anchoring them will ensure they don't unravel.Repeat the above steps as desired. If you're looking for a little cluster of these, just start again at Step 1 just a thread or two away from the first french knot. Stay at it until you're happy with your grouping. You'll have mastered the french knot by the end.

Have another person measure the garment so that it is an equal distance off the floor.,
Set up your iron and ironing board.,
Fold over a quarter of an inch of hem and iron that down.

Thread your needle with about eighteen inches of thread.,
Slip the knot under the fold of fabric to catch the hem.,
Double back on your stitch every so often.",How to Do Blind Hem on Light Weight Fabrics Like Voile," Trim it off at the lowest equal point.;
, Set your iron to your fabric's setting. If your fabric setting isn't a steam setting, set the iron to the lowest steam setting and set the steam as low as possible (sometimes fine fabrics will water-spot, simply set your iron to the lowest heat setting and iron until the water spots have evaporated).

,,, Empty the water from it. (Store the iron completely dry for best working order next time.)

, Yes, you will have to stop sooner, but a shorter piece of thread insures smooth working without snags or as many mistakes. Tie a knot in one end of the thread -- don't tie them together -- you will be working with only one thread, this will help your stitches appear invisible.

, Then, catching just a few threads of the outside of the fabric start hemming. To speed yourself along catch first the hem then the fabric, then the hem until your needle is full, and then pull the thread until it lies flat again. Don't worry about doing anything fancy, just a basic slip stitch is fine.

, In other words, make another stitch directly on top of the last one. This will act as a safety: if part of your hem falls, it will stop before the whole thing unravels.


It is a good idea to buy pin and needles made for lightweight and silk fabrics,also there is thread that is light or made of silk that will work better than a regular thickness.

Plan to buy sewing scissors as an investment.,
Go to a fabric or quilting store to buy your sewing scissors, not a drugstore or office supply place.,
Look for recommendations from others who do a lot of sewing.,
Ask to hold the scissors and, if possible, try them out on a scrap of fabric.,
Consider how you will be using the scissors.,
Protect your sewing scissors.",How to Choose a Good Pair of Sewing Scissors," If you take good care of them, good scissors will last a long time, so it's best to make the investment up front rather than going through many pairs of poor scissors .


If money is tight, save up for a while and watch for sales and discounts on good scissors. You can select your scissors for quality and still pay a reasonable price.;
, Ask the opinion of the proprietors. People who run such stores often do a great deal of sewing themselves and in any case spend a lot of time cutting fabric.

, If you don't know anybody who sews personally, ask them, and ask if you can try their favorite scissors. Also look on forums online.

, Make sure they are comfortable in your hand and you have good control. Does the weight and heft feel right for what you are doing and the size of your hands?

, If you do a lot of cutting from patterns on a table or mat, you may prefer to have handles that are offset from center so that the the bottom can be fairly flat against the surface. Do you cut heavy fabrics or fine details?

, Never use them to cut paper, except for the thin tissue that sewing patterns are made from. Keep them in your sewing kit, away from children who might try to use them for craft projects. Use a permanent marker to write on the sides ""fabric only"" so that you and your family can easily tell the difference. Have separate scissors available for cutting paper.

Prepare your natural fabric properly, if it is an item that needs to be laundered.,
Rip out the seam and redo.,
Use lots of pins.,
Straighten the fabric gently while sewing it.,
Use basting.,
Use the ease stitch.,
Check your sewing machine.,
Is your fabric cut out correctly?",How to Avoid Puckers when Sewing," Cottons, linen, wool, and silk will all change consistency when laundered.Typically, it will shrink. If you sew it and then wash it, seams may pucker or at the very least wrinkle.

Wash on the highest temperature setting available.
Dry on the highest temperature available.
Iron. Be sure your fabric is smooth and wrinkle-free before sewing.;
, Sometimes a pucker is a simple matter of misalignment of the fabric. Simply picking out the seam, and trying again is typically enough to solve matters. However, if it continues to be an issue, it may be time to really slow down and pinpoint the problem., Pins are inexpensive, so be generous in using them. The easiest way to keep fabric from puckering while sewing is to put lots of pins in the fabric. In this way, there are more fasteners to keep the fabric in place while you sew.

Make sure that you have plenty of pins along where the seam will go. Check that the pins are placed approximately where you'll be stitching.
Be sure to keep the fabric smooth while pinning. Ideally, pin on a wide, flat surface like a table or a floor.
Place the pins in at the intended seam, rather than off to one side.

, While running the fabric through the machine, take the fabric in both hands and stretch the seam taut so that it stays smooth when you sew it. Be careful if you do this with stretchy fabric, (such as ones containing Lycra) or very delicate fabric (such as silk or gauzy cotton)., Pin the seam well, then baste it.

Baste the seam, that is, sew along your intended seam using the biggest stitches available on your machine. Or, you can do so by hand.
If your basting turns out well, simply sew over the basted stitches using the proper stitch length. If it does not, pick out the trouble spots and redo them. Since you basted first, it is much easier to rip out incorrect seams.

, If you are trying to sew two pieces of fabric together and one of them is a bit larger than the other, you can try an ease stitch.

Take the larger piece of fabric and mark where your final seam will be.
Sew the ease stitch. In the seam allowance of the larger piece of fabric, sew a seam parallel to your intended final seam, but in larger basting stitches, making sure to leave long ends of thread at either end of the seam.
Pull the thread ends gently, gathering the fabric slightly until it is the same length as the smaller piece to which it will be stitched.
Pin the two pieces of fabric together and stitch your final seam.

, Sometimes it really is your sewing machine causing the problem. Check the tension and double-check if it is sewing properly. If it is in need of maintenance, that may contribute to puckering., Occasionally, a mis-cut (either too short or too long) will cause fabric not to line up properly when sewn. In the attempt to sew pieces together, it will not line up properly and in your attempt to make it fit will end up puckering."

Pick a thread.,
Thread the darning needle.,
Pull the sock over the darning egg.,
Trim away any ragged edges.,
Push the needle through one end of the hole.,
Repeat your stitches.,
Now sew stitches perpendicular to the parallel stitches (optional.)",How to Darn a Sock," You will need to pick a thread that is close to the color and thickness of the existing sock yarn. You can also use a dark color for horizontal stitching and a lighter color for vertical stitching. If you have a dark sock, using white thread will help you to see what you’re doing more easily. Same goes for a white sock and dark thread. It doesn't have to match exactly--unless you are a foot model, not too many people will see your sock-covered feet.






;
, This article says darning needle, but really it can just be a regular old needle. You will want to thread the needle with one or two strands of thread, depending on the weight of the sock. As you may have guessed, if it is a thicker sock you will want to use a thicker thread (or two pieces of thread.) Tie a knot in the end of the thread. You will begin by sewing from the inside of the sock, out, so that your knot is on the inside of your sock.








, These little darning eggs are wooden ovals that help to push the toe of the sock out so that you can see where the hole is. You can buy them at any craft store.








If you don’t have a darning egg or don’t want to buy one, you can pretty much use anything that is round. A tennis ball works well, as does a lightbulb, so long as you are very careful. You can also just use your other hand--stick it in the sock like you would your foot. This last option will make darning your sock a bit more difficult.

, Use little sewing scissors to snip away any threads or flyaway string that are hanging from the hole. Just make sure that you don’t actually snip one too many times and make your hole even larger.







, You are now going to make a large running stitch to the other side of the hole. A running stitch is the most basic of sewing stitches. All it involves is running your needle and thread up through the inside of the sock of the sock and out, then making a stitch to the right, and then pulling your needle back up and out of the sock again.








You can also choose to sew a running stitch for a few rows above and to either side of the hole. Doing this reinforces the sewing you will be doing to close the hole up and supports the thread around the hole (which is probably pretty thin and on the verge of forming a hole itself.)














, You will want to run your stitches up and over the hole, going back and forth until the hole is blocked up with parallel stitches.








, Creating stitches that go perpendicular to your previously made stitches will reinforce the patch you have essentially created out of thread. Weave your stitches in and out of the previous stitches.

Choose the appropriate needle for your thread.,
Cut the length of thread you need.",How to Thread a Needle and Tie a Knot1," Needles come in many different sizes, and its important to choose one with an eye, or an opening, big enough for the thread you are using.


Consider buying a pack of needles in many different sizes, so you can try a few until you find one that's the right size.
If you need help figuring out what needle to use, ask a salesperson at the fabric or sewing store where you bought your supplies.

, A piece of thread longer than 36 inches (91 cm) could get tangled as you sew, but a short piece of thread could run out quickly, and you'll be required to thread the needle again before you know it. Determine the length that's right for your project.









If you're not sure how long to cut the thread, err on the side of a shorter length; you can always rethread the needle with more thread later, but a tangled piece of thread can be a pain to straighten out.
Cutting the thread at a 45-degree angle using a sharp pair of scissors will create a point that's easier to thread through the needle.

Insert the thread through the eye of the needle.,
Pull the thread through the needle.,
Hold the other end between your thumb and forefinger.,
Wrap the thread around your finger.,
Rub the thread loop.,
Pull the loop into a knot.",How to Thread a Needle and Tie a Knot2," Hold the needle between your thumb and forefinger with the eye pointing up. Hold the tip of the thread between the thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Insert the thread through the needle's eye.


If you have trouble seeing the needle's eye, turn on a bright lamp to provide better visibility.
Wetting the tip of the thread with your tongue, then flattening it with your lips, creates a stiffer tip that is easier to insert into the eye.;
, Pull several inches of the thread through the eye of the needle so that you have a generous tail hanging down. This helps to keep the needle from becoming unthreaded as you work on tying the knot.








, Make sure the thread doesn't slip through the needle as you grasp the other end.

, Use your thumb to hold the loose thread end in place against your forefinger. Use your free hand to wrap the thread once around the forefinger, so that you have one complete loop of thread around your finger.








, Use your thumb to start rubbing the thread loop against your forefinger. Continue rubbing and rolling it toward the tip of your finger, then carefully slip it off, keeping the loop intact.









The thread loop should now be wrapped around itself like a vine, with the end poking out from the loop.
If the loop comes undone, try again. Practice makes perfect with this method.

, Use your fingers to grasp the thread end sticking up from the loop. Hold the other side of the thread, which should still be threaded through the needle, between the thumb and forefinger of your other hand. Pull on the thread from either side with both hands so that the loop shrinks and becomes a knot.









If the loop doesn't knot, that means the thread wasn't properly woven together at step 4. Repeat the process and focus on creating a woven loop.
For a larger knot, repeat the process, making sure the knot falls into the woven thread loop. When you shrink the loop into a knot it should fall directly over the first knot.
For a more durable strand of thread, use the double strand method. Instead of leaving a tail after you thread the needle, pull the thread through and hold the thread tips together. Follow the same directions for tying a knot with one strand, keeping the two strands together throughout the process.

, Hold the tip of the thread to the threader and put it through the hole. Grasp the end of the thread and pull it through the threader so that you have a few inches of tail hanging through the threader.








, Slowly back the threader out of the eye. As it exits the eye it will pull the thread through, too. Take the threader off of the end of the thread. Your needle should now be threaded.








, Hold the the longer end of the thread perpendicular to the needle. Wind the thread around the needle twice. For a thicker knot, wind it around three times.








, Carefully pull the wound thread loops down the needle to the eye, then continue pulling the loops down the entire length of the thread.








, When you've reached the end of the thread with the thread loop, tighten it into a knot.

Run back over the final ½ inch (1.27 cm) of the fabric.,
Remove excess thread.",How to Mend a Torn Seam," Choose a needle and thread according to the item you are trying to repair. If you are working with a delicate fabric such as chiffon, lace, or silk, choose a thin needle and correspondingly thin thread. If you are working with a heavier fabric, such as denim or canvas, you will need a thick needle and thick thread. If the seam will be visible, be sure to choose a color corresponding to the surrounding fabric., Loop the thread through the eye of your needle. If the edge of the thread is frayed or otherwise impaired, trim back until the thread is smooth with a blunt end. If necessary, wet the end of the thread before passing through the head of the needle.You can either loop a single piece of thread through the eye of the needle, or two ends of the thread to create a thicker sewing tool. As can be expected, a thicker gathering of thread will be better for heavy-duty fabrics.

, When measuring the amount of thread to use, double the length of the seam, and add another inch or two. While you may wind up with too much thread, it is far better to have too much thread than to have too little, as you may be able to see where your stitch starts and stops in the middle of the torn area., Different stitches work well for different fabrics and problems. A simple whip stitch is wonderful for delicate fabric, while a running stitch will do well with a sturdy fabric. If you are dealing with an exposed seam, a backstitch will provide a discreet means of repair.If you are a beginner, a running stitch is likely to be the easiest option, as it involves going in a single, straight line.
A backstitch is another good beginner option. To backstitch, push your needle through the fabric, pull your thread all the way through, and push your needle up through the bottom of the fabric ¼ an inch (.635 cm), before placing your needle at your starting point and pulling the thread all the way through again. Continue this process to create a clean backstitch.

, Once you’ve chosen your stitch, begin to repair your seam, holding the fabric taut to prevent wrinkling or snagging. Try to keep your stitches as even and uniform as possible, favoring a tighter stitch rather than a loose one. While a loose stitch will be faster and easier, you run the risk of the repaired seam weakening and reopening quickly., Once you have reached the edge of the torn seam, tie a firm knot to prevent further fraying and damage. If your knot is too loose, your newly-repaired seam may begin to unravel, while a tight knot may cause snagging. Smooth the fabric to make sure there are no wrinkles or problems, then tie a knot to lie flush against the fabric.


Tying the knot will be easier if you keep the needle intact and pull the needle through the loop you’ve made for your knot. This is especially true if you have only an inch or so of extra thread.

, Turning the fabric right-side-out, gently pull apart the area you’ve mended, making sure there are no ripples, remaining holes, or snags. If you do find a snag, use a seam-ripper to remove your thread, and start again.While you do want to check to make sure your seam is solid, avoid yanking on the seam, as this can damage even the most well-constructed item of clothing.

, Choose the color that best suits your seam, whether it is visible or not. Although the color may not seem important initially, if the fabric in question is even a tiny bit sheer, a dark or light thread will be immediately visible. Choose a color as close to the fabric or existing thread as possible.

, New and old sewing machines come with a wide array of settings, ranging from the length of a stitch to the type of stitch being used. Consult your machine’s manufacturer’s booklet or instruction manual to determine how to choose a setting, and which setting is the optimal setting for your fabric., Place the fabric in need of repair below the foot, beginning ¼-½ inch in front of the torn seam. If possible, line the existing thread up with the machine’s needle to keep the appearance of the seam uniform.

, Gently press down on the machine’s pedal, feeding your fabric through the machine carefully and slowly. Again, though you may think it is best to get the job done quickly, the needle could snag even a thick fabric if it is passed through too quickly. Take your time.


Remove your pins as you go, making sure they do not pass beneath the machine’s needle. Although it could skip over the pin, you run the risk of breaking the needle when it hits the pin.

, Once you have reached the end of the tear, go back over your fabric to close the thread loop. Once you have done that, lift the foot, and remove the fabric from beneath the foot.½ an inch (1.27 cm) is more than enough space. Going over any more of the fabric may result in accidentally ripping up your repaired stitches.

, Snip the thread from the bobbin and needle, and trim any excess fabric or thread from the newly-mended area. If there are frayed edged, be sure to trim those too, as leaving a frayed edge behind could result in additional fraying.Be sure to remove your fabric from the machine slowly; you must cut the thread from the bobbin and needle before trimming up any leftover thread.

Scrap fabric of any kind, shape, or size for testing threading on a sewing machine

Iron the garment you wish to hem.,
Measure the hemline.,
Trim the fabric to a suitable length below the chalk or pin line.,
Fold the hem.,
Use a whipstitch if you don't have a lot of time.,
Try a catch stitch for more elasticity and strength.,
Make a slip stitch hem for near invisibility.,
Make a fell stitch for extra durability.,
Measure and cut your thread.,
Prepare your needle and garment.,
Start with a tiny stitch at the seam line on the wrong side of the hem.,
Make your stitch pattern.,
Knot the thread at the end of stitching the hem.,
Try on the garment to test the balance of the hemline.",How to Hand Sew a Hem," It's important to remove any creases and bumps so that the garment is sitting flat and the hemline you create will be accurate.






;
, Put on the garment, stand in front of a mirror, and decide where you'd like the new hem to fall. Mark that point with pins or chalk.


It may be helpful to have a friend help with this step.
In determining the hem length, it's recommended that you wear the shoes that you'll be wearing with the particular garment, as this will ensure the final length is most accurate.

, First, decide how deep you want the hem, then trim the excess fabric. There should be enough fabric to accommodate the hem depth. For example, if you want a 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep hem, leave 1 inch (2.5 cm) of fabric below the hemline. There must be enough fabric left to be able to turn up the hem, but not too much, or the hem may appear bulky.









A one inch (2.5 cm) hem may be recommendable for pants, while 3/4 inch (2 cm) works well for blouses.

, For most hems, you can make single fold along the hemline, wrong side to wrong side. The wrong side of the fabric is the ""inside"" of the garment, the side you don't see. The ""right side"" is the side you see on the exterior.








, This is a quick method, but it's the least durable because the thread is exposed and is easily frayed. On the wrong side of the garment it produces slanted stitches, while on the right side it makes very small, barely visible stitches.









Hide your thread knot and bring the thread from the inside through the outside of the hem fold.
Moving from right to left (or left to right if you're left-handed), cross over diagonally and pick up a few threads of the fabric above the fold. Keep the needle pointed in the direction in which you're working.
Bring the needle back out through the fold and repeat., The catch stitch creates a slight criss-cross effect on the wrong side and small, and nearly-invisible stitches on the right side. Take note: this stitch moves in the opposite direction than you would normally work. Right-handed people will work left to right, while left-handed people will work right to left.









Hide the knot by pulling the needle outwards through the fold.
Point the needle in the opposite direction from the one in which you're working. Pick up a few threads of the fabric just above the hem and pull through.
Now pick up a bit of fabric from the hem and pull through, with the needle still facing in the opposite direction, and repeat., This technique makes clean, tiny stitches on both the right and wrong sides for a clean finish. It gets its name from the stitches that slip through the fold of the hem edge. Righties work right to left with the needle pointed left; lefties, left to right with a right-pointing needle.









Hide the knot by pulling the needle outwards through hem, right at the very edge of the fabric.
In the fabric just above the hem, pick up a few threads and pull the needle through.
Reinsert the needle into the edge of the fold, just below where the previous stitch ended. Pull it through the edge of the hem about 1/4 inches (7mm), as if you were pulling it through a tube of fabric, and then outwards.
Repeat the first three steps., The fell stitch is very strong, but leaves a row of conspicuous diagonal stitches on the right side. If you're dealing with very thick fabric, you can try making the stitches without passing all the way through so the stitches are not visible from the exterior. Righties work right to left with the needle facing left; lefties work left to right with the needle facing right.









Hide the knot by passing the needle outward through the upper edge of the hem fold.
Pass the needle through the fabric above the hem edge, about 1/4-1/2 inch (6-13 mm) long. Complete the stitch by passing the needle through a few threads of the top of the hem fold.
Start your next stitch in the fabric right above the end of the previous one and repeat., The length you use depends on the circumference of the hem, but it's always better to have too much thread than too little. A good rule of thumb is to use around 18 inches (46 cm), or an arm-length of thread.Use a thread that matches the garment color as closely as possible.

, Thread a small needle and tie a knot at the other end of the thread. Turn your garment wrong-side out. Work with the hemline facing towards you.








, In other words, you're bringing the needle up from behind the upper edge of the hem fold. Do not pass this stitch through to the right side of the garment. It should only go through the hem fold.








, Keep stitching around, working from right to left, or left to right. Make small, evenly-spaced stitches. While the thread should not be excessively slack, never pull the stitches tightly.







, Make a small stitch twice in the same place on the edge of the hem fold as your first stitch, but for this last stitch, do not pull the thread all the way through. Pass the needle through the loop twice, then tighten the knot by pulling on the thread.









Hide the ""tail"" of the thread by passing the needle horizontally about 1 inch (2.5 cm) in between the folded hem. Do not pierce all the way through to the right side of the garment.
Bring the needle out onto the wrong side and cut away the remaining thread., Hopefully it's good to go; otherwise, you will need to adjust by unpicking and resewing any areas that appear uneven.


If you've used the quick-and-easy whipstitch to hand hem your item but you want the hem to be more durable, simply use one of the other methods suggested above or machine stitch the hem at a later date. The beauty of the whipstitch method is that it allows for temporary fixes or testing of hem lengths, which can be ideal for travel, fashion shows or shoots, designing, and so on.

 Fold again and press for double fold.",How to Make Your Own Bias Tape,"

Cut out strips of fabric for your bias tape. To do this, first mark your cutting lines on the fabric using chalk pencil or dressmaker's pen. Decide how wide you need your finished product to be, how long you need it, and whether or not you want it to be double fold or single fold (scroll to the bottom for pictures of both). If you make single fold, make your strips twice as wide as you want your finished product to be. If you make double fold, your strips need to be 4 times as wide as your finished tape. For example, for double fold, 1/2"" wide, cut out 2"" strips.
When you mark the cutting lines, remember this is bias tape, so the lines have to run at a 45 degree angle to the selvage.
Cut enough strips so that when they are sewn together you'll have the length you need plus some extra.
Keep in mind that the triangles formed at the ends are wasted, as is a small triangle underneath the strips (you could use it in a pinch, but the strips you get will be quite short).;
,

After you mark and cut the strips, square off the ends. The two strips on the left have been squared off - the ones on the right haven't been yet.,

Start attaching the strips. Place one over the other at a right angle, right sides together. Make sure the square ends line up.,

Stitch diagonally from corner to corner of the overlapping squares.
,

Sew all the strips together using the same method. The seam will look like this. Be sure that you are consistent with how you assemble your seams; otherwise you will end up with seams angling both directions.,,,

Press the seam allowances flat.
,

Fold the strip in half lengthwise, right side out, and press.
,

Open up the strip again. Now press both raw edges into the center. This is single fold bias tape.,

To make double fold bias tape, fold again in the center and press.

Finished!

",How to Sew a Waistband," Some factors that must be considered are your waist measurement, fastening/overlapping fabric, and seam allowances. The format used here is shown below. You may alter it and adjust measurements accordingly.


Seam allowance - 1/4""
Lengthwise measurement - waist measurement + fastening space (2-3"", depending on the skirt) + seam allowance x 2 + growth room (optional)
Widthwise measurement - desired result width + seam allowance;
, Also consider washing the fabric beforehand so it won't shrink.








, Shown here is cutting using a mat, ruler, and rotary cutters, but you may use any preferred method.








,, Do not sew the remaining short edge.









It helps to have the sewing machine on needle-down setting so you can easily maneuver the corner.

Cut and remove the gathering thread.",How to Do Smocking," Smocking can be done using any type of fabric, but it works best if you use thin fabric that doesn't have a lot of stretch. Try thin cotton or linen if this is your first time. Choose embroidery floss in a matching or contrasting color. The stitches are meant to be seen to create a pretty dotted pattern.


Smocking gives fabric an elastic quality and makes it more form fitting. You'll need to take this into account when cutting fabric for the pattern you're using. Make it 2 1/2 to 3 times wider than what your pattern calls for.
If you'd rather not have visible stitching, choose a regular sewing thread (rather than thick embroidery floss) in the same color as your fabric.;
, Use a fabric pen or a pencil to draw a grid of evenly-spaced dots covering the area that you want to smock. The grid may be square or rectangular. The dots may be spaced close together or far apart, depending on how many pleats you want to make. A good starter measurement is placing the dots one inch apart, both across and down.

The lines of dots should line up with the grain of the fabric.
Be sure your dots are placed in straight lines across the fabric - otherwise your smocking will turn out crooked.
You can make your grid using iron-on dots as well, so you won't have to worry about measuring out the dots. Look for smocking patterns in your local sewing store.

, The first step will be to use a needle and thread to gather the fabric and hold it in place. Thread a needle and tie the end so that it won't pull through the fabric.









This placeholder thread will be trimmed away, so it doesn't matter what kind you use. The gathers will later be fastened with decorative stitches, and that's when you can use your pretty embroidery thread.

, Pass the needle through the fabric from one side of the first dot, under the dot to the other side. Pull the thread so that the knot rests alongside the dot.








, Pass the needle through the fabric from one side of the second dot, under the dot to the other side. Do the same with the third dot and on down the row until you reach the end. Wrap the tail of the thread around a pin to hold the stitches in place. Make each stitch as neat as possible, so that each dot has the same amount of room on either side.

, Thread your needle again and do the next row in the same way. Continue stitching the rows and securing the ends to a pin until all the rows are complete.

, Pull the end of the thread from the first stitched row gently, so that the fabric is folded into small, even gathers. The dots should be at the outward-facing top of each gather. Hold the gathers in place by securing the end of the thread around a pin or tying off the end with a knot. Gather the second row in the same way, taking care to make sure each gather is the same size as the gathers in the first row.








, It's time to use that colorful embroidery thread you picked out to create a smocked pattern. Tie off the end of the thread.








, Pull the thread through so that it comes out directly through the dot in the first gather.








, Move your needle to the second gather. Insert the needle on the right side of the dot and pass it under the dot so that the needle comes out on the left side. Move the needle back to the first gather and pass it under the dot where the thread is coming out. Pull the thread through, then cross it over the stitch you made and pass the needle back through the second gather. The completed stitch will look like a tiny ""x"" that cinches the gathers together. Your needle and thread should finish under the fabric.

, Skip the first dot in the second row and bring your needle up through the second gather, right where the dot is marked.








, Move your needle to the third gather. Insert it on the right side of the dot and pass it underneath so that the needle comes through on the left side. Move the needle back to the second gather and pass it under the dot where the thread is coming out. Pull the thread through, then cross it over the stitch you made and pass the needle back through the third gather to cinch the gathers. Your needle should finish under the fabric.

, Bring the needle up through the next empty dot in the top row. Using the same stitching method, stitch it to the adjacent gather, making a little ""x"" with your stitches and finishing with the needle under the fabric. Bring the needle up through the next dot in the second row and stitch to the adjacent gather. Continue alternating between rows until all the gathers in the first two rows have been stitched. Tie off the thread on the back side when you're finished.

x — x — x. — x — x — x


, Working two rows at a time, use the same process to stitch the gathers in the remaining rows with your embroidery thread.

x — x — x. — x — x — x
x — x — x. — x — x — x











Pull the gathers in the next two rows. Gently tug the thread to create even gathers, with the dots in the rows appearing at the top of each gather. Secure the thread by wrapping it around a pin at the end of the rows.
Stitch the first and second gather in the first row, finishing with your needle under the fabric.
Stitch the second and third gather in the second row, finishing with your needle under the fabric. (Don't forget to skip that first dot!)
Continue stitching adjacent gathers, alternating between the first and second rows, until all the gathers have been stitched.
Tie and trim the thread on the underside of the fabric.

, The thread you initially used to pull the gathers is no longer necessary. Unwind it from the pins and pull or cut it away, so that only your embroidery stitching is left.

Cut the pattern.",How to Read a Sewing Pattern," On most commercial patterns, the pattern is located in the top left corner. This number is used to identify the pattern design and size. Smaller pattern companies may replace the pattern number with a name., Sewing patterns are not one size fits all. Each pattern comes in multiple size ranges. Before purchasing a pattern, check the size range located to the right of the pattern number to make sure your size falls within the range., Pictures and or drawings of the garment will appear on the front of the pattern envelope. In addition to selling the garment, the images provide inspiration for fabric selection and information on how the garment is intended to fit. The images also depict design variations. The pattern contains the pieces necessary to create all of the variations., The design variations, also called “views,” also appear on the back of the envelope. These line drawings include more design details, such as darts, seam lines, and potential lengths. Each view is identified by a symbol, typically a letter. The symbol is used in charts and the pattern to identify information about that specific view., The back of the pattern envelope contains a list of fabrics suitable for this garment. Read through the list carefully. Select a fabric that is appropriate for the garment and that you are comfortable working with., In addition to fabric, your pattern may require notions and trims. The “Notions” section will list all of the additional pieces you will need to complete the garment. These may include items such as zippers, hook and eye closures, and elastic., Pattern sizing rarely aligns with ready to wear sizes. When cutting the pattern, you will follow lines for a specific size. Therefore, it is essential to accurately determine your size instead of assuming that you are a certain size.Use a measuring tape to measure various points on your body listed on the pattern envelope, such as your chest or bust, waist, and hips. Match your measurements to the measurements provided on the chart to determine your pattern size., The fabric requirements are listed directly below the body measurement and size charts. Locate the row containing the design variation you intend to create. Follow the row over until you reach the column containing your pattern size. The number in this cell is the amount of yardage you will need to complete the garment in your pattern size.


Most patterns will list alternative lengths for different widths of fabrics (45 inches wide v. 60 inches wide)., The last box in the chart contains information on the finished garment measurements. The finished garment will be slightly larger than your body measurements to allow for ease, or the fabric added to a garment so you may wear it comfortably. This information is often printed onto the pattern as well., The first page of the instruction booklet depicts images of the garment and its design variations. The line drawings show the front and the back of the garment. Under each drawing, you will once again find the garment’s corresponding symbol, typically a letter., Manufacturers often include line drawings of all the pattern pieces. Each image will be labeled, typically with a number. The number corresponds to a descriptive list located below the line drawings.


After reading the rest of the instructions, you may wish to mark which pattern pieces you will need., Prior to cutting and constructing your garment, devote time to reading the general sewing instructions thoroughly. This section contains information that may prevent you from making construction errors. It will provide you with details on items such as seam allowance and zipper insertion., Every design variation is accompanied with a corresponding cutting diagram. The layout depicts how all of the pattern pieces fit on the allotted amount of fabric.When viewing the diagram, make note of the following:


The grain line. The grain of the fabric runs parallel to the selvages of the fabric—the selvages are the finished edges of the fabric.. Each pattern piece will contain a line of arrows that corresponds to the grain line.
Bent grainline symbols. If a grainline symbol is bent at the top, this means the piece should be placed on a fold.
Double layer of fabric. A pattern may call for a specific piece to be cut out of a double layer of fabric., Unfold the pattern and lay it out on a flat surface. Retrieve your instruction book and turn to the cutting layout guide for your pattern. Use the cutting diagram to help you identify the pieces you will need for your garment.


The pattern pieces diagram may also be useful., Set your iron on low. Once the iron is preheated, iron the pattern. This will get rid of any wrinkle and folds in the paper. Carefully cut out each of the pieces at the correct size from the piece of pattern paper., Patterns contain various symbols. After cutting the pieces, familiarize yourself with the symbols printed on the pattern:


Single, heavy line: this is a cutting line.
Double parallel lines: these lines are used to lengthen or shorten a garment.
Triangles: triangular notches indicate where one piece will join with another piece.
Dots: these empty or filled circles indicate where seams start and stop., Prior to cutting the pattern, you must properly prepare the fabric. Wash, dry, and iron the fabric. Fold your fabric as instructed in the pattern. Lay out your washed and ironed fabric on a flat surface—the wrong side of the fabric should face up unless specified otherwise.


Always double check to make sure your fabric is machine washable., Flip the instructions open to the cutting diagram for your garment. Place and pin the pieces onto the fabric as described and shown in the cutting diagram. Before cutting, make sure your pieces are properly aligned with the grainline of the fabric., Retrieve a pair of sewing scissors. Carefully cut out the pattern. Rotate the fabric as needed."

Raise your arm.,
Wrap the tape measure from the shoulder to the armpit.,
Wrap the tape measure back up to the shoulder.,
Keep it comfortable.",How to Measure an Arm Hole1," Extend your arm straight out so that it is perpendicular to the rest of your body.


You can work with either the left or right arm.
It is easiest to take an accurate measurement for your Armhole if you have a second person helping you. Your helper will need to use the tape measure while you keep your arm in position.
If you do not have a helper to assist you, it might be easiest to measure the Armhole of your non-dominant arm while using your dominant hand to hold and maneuver the tape measure. You should stand in front of a full-length mirror, as well.;
, Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure flat against the the center of your shoulder. Draw the tape measure down over the front of your shoulder and arm, pausing once it hits the center of your armpit.


This measurement is sometimes referred to as your Armhole depth.It is not a full Armhole measurement, however, so you should keep going if you need the full measurement instead of the depth measurement.
Keep the tape measure flat against your body. It should also be vertically straight along the front of your body.

, Continue wrapping the tape measure around your arm and shoulder, drawing it up from behind your shoulder until it meets the starting end.This measurement is your full Armhole measurement.
The tape measure must be vertically straight along the back and front of your shoulder. Make sure that it also lies flat against your body.
Note that your full Armhole measurement should be twice as large as your Armhole depth. Since it may not be exactly twice as large, though, it is best to take the actual measurement instead of mathematically doubling the depth measurement.

, With the tape measure held in place, move your arm around. Rotate it back and forth, then up and down. The tape measure should not be tight enough to restrict the movement of your arm in any way.


As a general rule, place two fingers underneath the measuring tape and against your body as you take the measurement. Do not stretch the tape, either. Following these two precautions should prevent the Armhole from being too tight.When in doubt, a measurement that is slightly too large is better than one that is too small.

Find a shirt that fits well.,
Curve the tape measure around the front Armhole.,
Measure the back Armhole separately.,
Add the two measurements together.",How to Measure an Arm Hole2," Choose a shirt with comfortable, appropriately sized arm holes. Spread this shirt out flat over a hard surface, like a table or desk.


Smooth out the material so that there is no bunching around the Armhole area.
The sleeve length of the shirt does not matter. It can even be sleeveless as long as it has an actual Armhole. Do not use a tank top with spaghetti straps, a halter top, or a strapless top, though.
This method is good to use if you do not have a helper to assist you in taking a traditional Armhole measurement.

, Make sure that the front of the shirt faces up. Position the starting (zero) end of the tape measure at the top of the Armhole seam, then carefully adjust the tape measure along the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom.


You will need to keep the tape measure on its side as you wind it around the Armhole seam.
Keep the tape measure aligned to this seam as precisely as possible.
The resulting measurement corresponds to your Armhole depth. It is only about half of your full measurement, though.

, Flip the shirt over to the back. Smooth it out, then measure the back Armhole seam with your tape measure.


As before, position the starting end of the tape at the top of the Armhole seam. Extend the tape down the curve of the seam until it reaches the bottom.
Your front and back Armhole depth will usually be the same. The back Armhole depth can occasionally be larger by as much as 5/8 inch (1.6 cm), though, so it is best to take both measurements separately just to be safe.

, Add the front Armhole depth and back Armhole depth together to calculate your total Armhole measurement.


This is only an estimate of your true Armhole measurement, so it is not quite as accurate as a traditional measurement would be. Nonetheless, this estimate should still produce satisfactory results in most instances.

Identify the stitching line.,
Measure along the curve.,
Take a measurement from the back piece, as well.,
Add the measurements together.,
Consider the ease.,
Adjust as needed.",How to Measure an Arm Hole3," Look at the front pattern piece and identify the stitching line along the Armhole opening.


The stitching line is the dotted line indicating where you will actually make your stitches. Do not measure along the outer perimeter of the Armhole since that measurement would not accurately reflect the dimensions of the eventual hole.
If you are drafting the pattern from scratch instead of working with a commercial pattern or previously made pattern, you will need to sketch the stitching line in place. Use a French curve or curved ruler to make sure that the seam allowances are the same all along the Armhole.

, Place the starting (zero) end of the tape measure at the top of the Armhole stitching line, just beneath the seam allowance. Extend the tape down along the curve until you reach the bottom seam allowance.You should not include the seam allowances in your measurement since they have no impact on the size of the actual opening.
The tape measure will need to stand on its side as you work with it. Make sure that the tape follows the stitching line precisely.

, Locate the stitching line on the back pattern piece. Place the starting end of the tape measure at the top of the Armhole stitching line, then wind it down the curve until it reaches the bottom.


As with the front pattern piece, you should not include the seam allowances in your measurement. Doing so would skew the results.

, Add the front Armhole measurement to the back Armhole measurement. The sum of the two will indicate the dimensions of the total Armhole measurement.


The back Armhole measurement might be larger than the front Armhole measurement by 1/2 inch to 5/8 inch (1.25 to 1.6 cm).If the measurements are off by more than this amount, however, the balance is off.
Also note that the back Armhole measurement should not be smaller than the front Armhole.

, The total Armhole measurement should be altered as needed to allow for ease of movement in the final piece.


The material can make a difference. If you're working with a pattern drafted to woven fabrics but choose to work with a knit fabric, shorten the ease by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). If you are working with a knit pattern but want to convert it for use with woven fabrics, lengthen the ease by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm).
If you took your Armhole measurement and added some slack into the measurement already, you do not need to add in extra ease here.

, If the Armhole on the pattern is too large or too small, you may need to adjust it before cutting and sewing your material.


The simplest way to do this is to make the curve of the Armhole deeper or more shallow. The curve should be deeper if you need the Armhole to be bigger. It should be more shallow if you need the hole to be smaller.
Do not alter the shoulder or side seams to change the Armhole measurement.
Keep in mind that no matter what you do, the base of the Armhole from the front pattern piece must meet with the base of the Armhole from the back pattern piece. The same applies to the top points of the Armhole.
When you alter the Armhole size of a pattern, you will also need to alter the shoulder opening of any sleeve you plan to attach so that the two measurements will match.

If you do not have Adobe Reader, make sure that your program will be able to read the pattern files., Every pattern will be a little different.Some patterns will need to be assembled first, while others will need to be cut first. Some may even have specific scaling instructions.

If your pattern's instructions are different from the ones in this article, you should follow them instead.

, Some patterns will include extra information that you do not absolutely have to print out. This includes things like other sizes, cover pages, and variations. You can also save time, paper, and ink by not printing those. You can also handwrite the material list before taking it to the store, and you can always read the instructions from your computer., Make sure that the printer is set to 100%, full scale, or no scale. Do not select ""shrink to fit"" or ""fit to page."" The pattern will print on multiple pages, which is fine.Pay attention to the layout. Some patterns need to be printed Portrait style while others need Landscape., Most patterns will have a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) box that you need to print out. You can find this within the first few pages of the document. Find the page that contains this and print it out. Do not print the entire pattern out just yet.Some patterns will have a set of arrows or a black bar instead.

, These items will usually have a measurement printed on them or right next to them. Measure the item with a ruler first, then compare that measurement to what's printed on the page. The measurements need to match up exactly., If the actual measurements of the test square did not match up with what's printed on the page, you will need to check your printer settings and make any necessary adjustments.

If your measurement is bigger than the printed measurement, your pattern will be too big and needs to be scaled down.
If your measurement is smaller than the printed measurement, your pattern will be too small and needs to be scaled up.

, Now that you know what you need to print and that your pattern is scaled properly, go ahead and print out your pattern. Remember to print only what you need. Don't print out all of the sizes and variations unless you need to.

Most patterns will print out in the order that they need to be assembled. Pay attention to this., In this method, you will be assembling the pattern first, then cutting it out. It will work just like a store-bought pattern, which comes on a big sheet. This will take up a lot of space. Find a large table to work on, or clear some space on your floor., Most patterns will have little symbols, letters, or numbers along the joining edges that you have to line up. You should match up like symbols with like symbols, such as 1a with 1a and 1b with 1b.Most instructions will have a diagram of what the completed pattern pieces should look like. Check your pattern pieces against this diagram.

, Some pattern pieces need to be overlapped while others don't Take a look at your pattern pieces. If the lines extend to the edges of the paper, then they should be aligned edge-to-edge. If there is a space or margin, then you should overlap them.

Sometimes, the spaces or margins need to be trimmed off. If they cover part of the pattern, you will need to trim them off.

, If the patterns are butted up against each other, with no overlap, lay down a long strip of tape across the seam.If the pattern pieces overlap, connect them using a glue stick or strip of double-sided tape.Consider applying another layer of tape across all of the seams on the back of the entire pattern page. This will give it extra stability., Pay attention to the different sizes. Many patterns include multiple lines, one for each size. Also, pay attention to the seam allowances. Some patterns include them while others don't., In this method, you will be cutting out all of the pieces first, then putting them together. Depending on the type of pattern you are working with, you might need a lot of space. For example, a long skirt will require a lot more space than a pair of gloves., Keep like pieces together with like pieces. For example, if you are cutting a princess dress, keep all of the sleeve pieces together, all of the skirt pieces together, and all of the bodice pieces together., PDF patterns will usually have little symbols along the edges that you have to line up. Match up like symbols with like symbols. For example, you should match up single arrows with single arrows, and double arrows with double arrows., If the pattern's edges have a space or margin, then they need to be overlapped. If the pattern's lines extend all the way to the cut edges, then they don't need to be overlapped. They should be placed side-by-side instead., If the pieces overlap, join them using a glue stick or a piece of double-sided tape. If the pattern pieces don't overlap, connect them with a strip of tape placed across the seam."

Trace the seams with chalk.,
Spread out the pattern paper.,
Flatten the original garment on top of the paper.,
Trace around the perimeter of the largest area.,
Repeat for the back and the smaller pieces.,
Sketch a seam allowance.,
Cut out the pieces.",How to Make Your Own Sewing Patterns1," Spread out the garment you want to copy so that it lies flat and face-up. Trace each front seam of the garment with white chalk.


This technique can be used on any garment, but it does work best on simple garments stitched together from simple shapes. You can also use this garment to make a copycat pattern of sewn accessories, like handbags.
For the time being, focus on the seams surrounding the largest part of the front portion of the garment. You will work on the front of the garment first, starting with the largest section and gradually moving through the smaller sections. After that, you will work on the back.
For example, if you want to make a copycat pattern of a dress, chalk the sleeve seams and the seam separating the torso from the skirt (if applicable).;
, Lay out a large piece of brown postal wrapping paper, spreading it flat over a hard surface.A hard surface will make the transfer and tracing process easier. Avoid doing this on carpet or other soft surfaces.
Stiff corkboard works well because you can pin the garment in place as you work.Brown postal wrapping paper is also ideal because it comes in large amounts. Moreover, chalk shows up on the paper relatively well.

, Place your garment chalk-side down on your paper. Straighten the garment out, then carefully apply pressure on the back of the garment along each seam.


Use your non-dominant hand or weights to keep the garment still and flat against the paper. Simultaneously use your dominant hand to rub over the back of your garment around any area you chalked previously.
If done correctly, the chalk on your garment should rub off onto the paper.
You can pin the garment to the paper as you work, but only do this if you are working on top of corkboard or a similar porous surface. Stick the pins straight through the garment, the paper, and the corkboard.

, With the garment still lying flat, trace around the top, bottom, and side edges of the garment using your chalk.


Make sure that the garment remains flat and still.
Only trace around the edges of the main section. Each section requires its own pattern piece, so you need to focus on one section at a time.
For example, if working on your copycat dress pattern, you would need to trace around the neckline and the sides of the torso during this part. If the skirt and torso form one big piece and are not connected by a seam, trace around the sides and bottom of the skirt, as well.

, For each separate section of the garment, you will need to chalk the seams and press them against the paper. Likewise, you will need to trace around the edges of each section, as well. Create a separate pattern piece for each separate section of the garment.


Finish the front pieces first, then move onto the back pieces.
For example, on a copycat dress pattern, you might need to make front sleeve pieces, a front skirt piece, back sleeve pieces, a back torso piece, and a back skirt piece.
Make sure that you mark what each piece is as you work.
Do not draw the pattern pieces directly next to each other on the paper. Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between pieces.

, Remove the garment from the paper and sketch out a second parallel line 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) out from each edge of each pattern piece.


Technically, most commercial pieces use a seam allowance of 5/8 inches (1.6 cm), so you opt for that measurement instead of the 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Regardless of what you choose, be consistent and use the same allowance for each piece.

, Use sharp scissors to cut out each pattern piece along the seam allowance lines.


This should complete the process.

Sketch out the neckband.,
Cut out the neckband.",How to Make Your Own Sewing Patterns2," You'll need to measure around your torso, arms, and neck. Add 2 inches (5 cm) or so to most of the measurements so that the shirt will have some ""ease,"" or comfortable looseness. You will need to measure:


The half neck: loosely hang a string around your neck. Measure this string, add the ease measurement, and divide by two.
The half shoulder: measure the distance between your shoulders, add the ease, and divide by two.
The quarter bust: measure your bust, add the ease, and divide by four.
The quarter waist: measure the smallest part of your waist, add the ease, and divide by four.
The quarter hip: measure the widest part of your hips, add the ease, and divide by four.
The high shoulder point (HSP) to upper chest: locate the point between the base of your neck and your shoulder. Measure from this point to your upper chest, bringing the tape measure under your armpit. Add the ease.
The distance between your HSP and natural waist.
The distance between your HSP ad hip.
The bicep half: measure the fullest part of your bicep with the arm down, add the ease, and divide by two.
The sleeve length: measure from your shoulder point to the point you want the sleeve to end.
The underarm seam length: measure from the armpit to the point you want your sleeve to hit, then subtract 1 inch (2.5 cm).
The wrist half, if making a long sleeve t-shirt: measure the circumference of your wrist and divide by two.

, Unroll a piece of paper longer than your HSP to hip and quarter hip measurements. One edge must be perfectly straight.


Lightly draw a perpendicular line out from the straight edge, starting 2 inches (5 cm) from the top of the paper and measuring as long as your half neck measurement. This is your HSP.
Lightly draw another perpendicular line 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) below the first. It should equal the length of your half shoulder measurement.
From the HSP, measure down the distance of your HSP to upper chest. Mark the spot.
Draw a perpendicular line directly over the last mark from the straight edge of your paper. It should equal your quarter bust.
From your HSP, measure down the distance of your HSP to waist and mark the spot. Draw a perpendicular line over this mark from the straight edge of the paper, equal in length to your quarter waist.
From your HSP, measure down the distance of your HSP to hip, and mark the end point. Draw a perpendicular line over this mark, starting at the straight edge of the paper, making it equal in length to your quarter hip.

, You'll need to connect the marks you measured out in a specific way to form the front of your t-shirt pattern.


Draw a slight concave curve extending from the HSP to the straight edge of the paper. This will be your front neck drop. The line should be horizontally straight for at least 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) at both ends.
Connect the HSP to your shoulder point with a very minor convex curve.
Draw a concave curve between your shoulder point and quarter bust line to create an armhole. It should be fairly straight as it drops down from the shoulder, and the curve should sharpen once it goes into the side of your shirt.
Draw a line from the bustline to the waistline, then all the way down to the hip. If you want straight sides, make a straight line. For a more fitted look, make a gently inward curve.
Draw a slight convex curve from the hip line to the straight edge of your paper. The end point should be about 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) below your hip line.
Note that when looking at the straight edge of your paper, you should look at it as the “center fold.” In other words, it is the vertical center of your shirt. When you cut material for this pattern, you will fold it along this “center fold” line and cut out two layers of fabric.

, Use the same method followed for the front shirt piece to sketch out a pattern piece for the back of the shirt. When you reach the back neck drop, make the drop less dramatic.


While the front neck drop can be 2 inches (5 cm) or more, the back should only be 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm).
If your pattern paper is see-through, you may want to consider laying a second piece on top of the first and tracing your front pattern piece to get you started on the back piece.

, You'll need to fold a piece of pattern paper in half. The paper should be 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) larger than your bicep half and sleeve length measurements.


Note that this should be a height-wise fold.
Measure the sleeve length along the folded edge, marking both the top and bottom of the measurement. Start at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top of the paper.
From the bottom mark, measure up the length of your underarm seam length, and mark the point.
Over this point, measure a perpendicular line out, making it the length of your bicep half. Mark the point.

, You'll need to plot the upper curve of your sleeve and the straight edges.


Measure your armhole distance on a measuring tape. Pinch the mark, then arrange the measuring tape on your pattern piece. Start on the bicep line. Allow it to come up at a perpendicular angle for 1 inch (2.5 cm) before curving it in and causing it to cross into the top of the fold at a right angle. Trace this line.
Draw another perpendicular line out from the bottom of the folded edge equaling the distance of the bicep half, minus 1 inch (2.5 cm).
Draw a straight line connecting the end of the previous line to the end of your first bicep half line.
Trace this plotted sleeve half onto the other side of the folded paper.

, Use your chalk to draw a second edge around all of your pattern pieces. This second edge will be your seam allowance.


The seam allowance should be 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) around the shirt front, back, and sleeve pieces.
At all of your hem lines, change this seam allowance to 1 inch (2.5 cm).

, Use sharp scissors to cut out each pattern piece along the seam allowance lines. Set aside until ready to use.


Make sure that each pattern piece is labeled accurately.

, For the neckband, you will need to measure out the front and back neck curves and draw a rectangle based on that.


Measure the front and back neck curves along the seam line, not the seam allowance edge. Multiply those numbers by two, then add them both together to get your neck circumference.
The length of your neckband rectangle should be 7/8 the size of this measurement.
The width of your neckband rectangle should be about 1-1/2 inches (3.8 cm), but you can alter this measurement based on how wide you want the neckband to be.

, Cut this pattern piece out, label it, and put it with the others.


This should complete the entire process.

Look for the scale given by the instructions and create a grid that reflects this proper size that the pattern should be.,
Place a piece of tracing paper over the grid.,
Begin tracing at a point where the pattern line coincides with an intersection of four squares.,
Work around the pattern piece carefully.,
Once finished tracing around the pattern, join up the dots.,
Draw on any symbols and markings to the pattern piece.,Label and cut out each pattern piece.,Tape together any adjoining pattern pieces that have crossed over pages.,Keep pattern pieces in a labelled envelope so that you don't lose them.,Proceed with your project!",How to Enlarge a Square Grid Sewing Pattern from a Book," A common scale is 1"" x 1"" / 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) x 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) per square but each pattern will vary, so be sure to check when making your grid.
, It is best if you tape it into place or it can shift on you as you are tracing over it., Make a dot at this point., Make a dot at each point where the pattern line intersects with a line on the grid., Use the eraser to remove wobbly lines or mistakes., This is important so that you know what needs to be done for each piece.,,,,"

Buy lining fabric at your local fabric store.,
Select a lining according to weight.,
Make sure that your lining doesn’t show through the skirt material.,
Review the construction of your skirt.,
Purchase several yards of fabric.,
Turn the skirt inside out.,
Set the lining facing up on your worktable.,
Flip the skirt over and move to a new section of fabric.,
Cut the lining material to size with fabric scissors.,
Use a seam ripper to take up the facing material, if your skirt has it.,
Sew a zigzag stitch around the exterior of the lining to prevent fraying.,
Pin the lining underneath the facing material.,
Cut around zippers or slits.,
Hand stitch around your seams.",How to Line a Skirt," Dress skirts and business attire usually employ shiny lining so that the skirt doesn’t catch at your legs. You can choose cotton to match a cotton skirt if you are lining a casual skirt.


A cotton lining will allow your legs to breathe more. However, it may catch on your legs and pantyhose just as the skirt would.
Cotton lining is used to turn a see-through skirt into a solid skirt, so that you don’t need to wear a slip.;
, You do not want to use a heavy lining to line a lightweight skirt., If it is a light skirt, consider white, beige or peach material.

, If it is easy to deconstruct, you can take a seam ripper to the hem and the sides to insert your skirt inside the hem. If it is solidly constructed, you will want to sew the lining on top of the skirt seams.

, Measure the length of the skirt and the width at the widest hem to see how much fabric you will need. Double the width and add one inch (2.5cm).

, You will use the existing skirt as your pattern for the lining. If you made the skirt yourself, find the pattern and use it to measure the lining.

, Place the inside out skirt on top of it. Draw around the edges of the skirt with a fabric pen. Measure and mark any slits or zippers on the lining fabric as best you can.


Use the skirt pattern as a template in place of this step for a homemade skirt.

, Repeat drawing around the outline of the other side of the skirt. Measure and include any zippers, slits or other features.

, Cut one-half inch (1.3cm) outside of the pattern line to account for seam allowances. Cut the bottom hem one inch (2.5cm) shorter so that the lining doesn’t go past the bottom hem.

, This is the material that folds inside the skirt, leaving finished edges.


For a better lining, you will want to set the lining inside the facing and sew it down with a basting stitch.

, Use thread that matches the lining fabric.

, If you don’t have facing material, pin it to the inside of the skirt, below the waistband and above the hem.


Pin the sides of the skirt. Your two pieces of lining should overlap at the edges.

, You want them to either go inside the facing or to the edge of the existing seam around those points.

, Use a whip stitch in a thread that matches your skirt fabric. When you stitch be careful to go through the lining material and the facing, but only gather a few inside threads on the skirt’s outside fabric.


You don’t want the stitches to show through.
A whip stitch is used to hem fabric down. The stitch will show on the inside more than the outside. After knotting the thread and anchoring it on the back side, insert the needle through a few threads of the outer fabric, point your needle forward one-eighth inch (0.3cm), and bring the needle up through the facing and lining layer. Pull the thread through and a long stitch will wrap around the edge on the inside. Repeat until the hem is complete.

If you are using a small spool of thread, place the cap on the pin so that the small side is next to the spool.;
, Feed the thread through the thread guides and around the bobbin winder tension discs.


Snap the thread into the small plastic thread guide lying directly to the left of the spool pin.
With the thread held in place by the thread guide, wind the thread clockwise around the bobbin winder tension discs in front of the guide.

, Insert the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin spool.


Feed the thread through from the inside so that the tail is still on the outside of the bobbin.
If you're using a bobbin with holes on both sides, only slip the thread through one hole.

, Place the bobbin on the bobbin winding spindle, located to the far right of the machine. Lock the spindle in place.


The tail of thread should still stick out through the top of the bobbin.
To lock the spindle in place, push the bobbin as far to the right as it will go. This sets the machine to its ""bobbin winding"" mode.

, Hold the thread tail and gently step on the foot control pedal. The machine should begin to wind the bobbin.


If desired, you can let go of the thread tail after the bobbin has wound a few rotations, but doing so is not necessary.
The machine should automatically stop once the bobbin is full.
Note that the hand wheel should not turn and the machine should not sew while the machine is in its bobbin winding mode.

, Cut the thread to separate the bobbin from the spool. Unlock the bobbin winding spindle and lift the bobbin away to remove it.Unlock the spindle by pushing it back to the left. Note that the machine will not sew until the bobbin winding spindle is back in its left position.
You should also trim the tail of thread sticking out from the top bobbin hole after removing the bobbin.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine until the needle reaches its highest point.


Turn the machine off before threading the needle.
Rotate the hand wheel toward you.
Raise the presser foot to release the tension discs at this time, as well.

, Place the spool of thread on the spool pin at the top of the machine. Fit the spool cap on the pin next to the spool of thread.


You'll need to lift up the spool pin before you can position the spool of thread on it.
For larger spools, the large side of the cap should face the spool. For smaller spools, the small side of the cap should face the spool.

, Draw the thread through the upper thread guide, then guide it around the guide an through the pre-tension spring.The upper thread guide is a latch lying to the left of the spool pin.
The pre-tension spring lies inside of a second latch positioned in front of the upper thread guide.

, Guide the thread down through the right channel at the front of the machine, then back up through the left channel.


You may need to pinch or hold the thread between the spool and the upper thread guide while doing this to maintain an appropriate amount of tension.

, Slide the thread into the slot of the take-up lever at the top of the left channel.


After inserting the thread through the take-up lever, pull it back down through the left channel again.

, Guide the thread through the horizontal lower thread guide and into the thin wire clamp guide.


The horizontal thread guide is a flat clip lying beneath the left channel.
The thin wire needle clamp is positioned directly above the needle.

, Feed the thread through the eye of the needle, inserting it from front to back.


Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through to the back of the needle.

, Press this lever down as far as it will go. The threader should swing into its threading position.This lever should be located to the left of the needle.
Note that these instructions only apply to models of the machine equipped with an automatic needle threader.
Standard needle threading instructions still apply when you use an automatic threader. This feature only assists you with inserting the thread through the eye of the needle; the rest of the process should be treated exactly the same way.
Even if your machine has this feature, you can still thread the needle by inserting it through the eye without assistance. This feature is only optional.

, Swing the thread down and around the thread guide hook to the left of the needle.

, Drag the thread through the hook lying directly to the right of the needle.


After inserting it through the hook, wrap the thread around that hook from bottom to top.

, Push the threading lever back up to release the automatic threading system. In doing so, you should cause a loop of thread to swing into the eye of the needle.


Grab that loop of thread and pull it through to the back of the needle.
Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of thread through the eye.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you until the needle reaches its highest position.


Make sure that the machine is off while you insert the bobbin.

, Open the hinged cover at the front of the machine and pull the bobbin case straight out.


To open the cover, grab it along the side and push it down. The cover will open but will not detach.
To remove the bobbin case, pull on the bobbin case tab and lift the case straight toward you.

, Hold the bobbin case with one hand while slipping the wound bobbin into the case with the other.The thread should run in a clockwise direction around the bobbin as you insert it into the case.
Keep a tail of thread roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long out of the case as you insert the bobbin.

, Grab the remaining tail of thread and pull it through the slit at the top of the bobbin case.


Continue sliding the thread through that slit until it slips under the finger of the case.

, Hold the loaded bobbin case by its hinged latch and slip it back into its place in the machine.


Release the latch. If the case has been positioned correctly, it should be secure inside the machine. You should not be able to remove it unless you lift the hinged latch again.
Close the cover when done by pushing it back up and into place.

, Turn the hand wheel at the side of the machine toward you. Continue until the needle goes through a full rotation, lowering into the machine and rising back out to its highest position.For the sake of safety, it is best to do this while the machine is off. The presser foot should also be raised during this procedure.
As you turn the wheel, you should see a loop of thread appear through the needle plate hole beneath the needle. This loop of thread is from the bobbin.

, Gently tug on the upper thread to release the loop and bring the lower bobbin thread completely through the needle plate hole.


Pull 6 to 8 inches (15.25 to 20.3 cm) of bobbin thread out through the plate.

, Position both threads so that they lie toward the back of the machine.


Both threads must pass beneath the pressure foot. The upper thread will need to slide through the ""toes"" of the pressure foot.
The completion of this step marks the completion of the entire threading process.

The Lutterloh System was invented in 1935 in Germany by Maria Aloisia Lutterloh (her maiden name was Aigenberger at that time).,
You need only two measurements (bust and hip) to make your own made to measure clothing patterns.,
The most important tool is the special sizing scale which is attached to an ordinary centimeter measure-tape.,
These numbers represent the bust and hip measurements in centimeters.

,
The smallest number 50 is about 18 inches (45.7 cm) and the highest number 140 is about 55 inches (139.7 cm).,
The scale is then guided around the pattern until it touches one of the lines with a number on it.,

After all the dots have been placed they are connected.,

Seam allowance needs to be added to the Lutterloh patterns.",How to Make Sewing Patterns That Fit," The system is also known as The Golden Rule pattern drafting system. Today the Lutterloh System is the most successful pattern making system for hobby seamstresses worldwide.;
, The system works for women's, men's and children's clothes.

, On this sizing scale there are numbers from 50 to 140.

,,
A pin is inserted into the hole corresponding to the number of the bust measurement and then placed in the center of the cross of the pattern design.

, This number stands for centimeters and means that a dot should be placed next to the tape measure at the respected number.
Below the waistline the dots are made with the hip measurement meaning that the pin in the scale needs to be removed from the bust measurement and inserted through the perforated hole in the sizing scale that corresponds to the hip measurement.

, The acrylic tailors curve and the designers curve make perfect lines and curves and are specially designed for all kinds of curves for clothing patterns. A foolproof way of getting the pattern right.

,
Sewing for yourself doesn't only mean thinking economically but first and foremost being creative. People have always had the desire to be able to make individual fashions that match their own taste in color, style and design.
Choosing and making your own patterns is the ideal way to create your personal style and achieve consistently proper fitting garments.
The Lutterloh System is ideal to make that dream come true.
The teaching kit the Lutterloh System contains 280 different fashions and clothing patterns from a simple bathrobe to elegant evening gowns.

Remember, it will not necessarily be the same size as the ready-to-wear clothing you already own, as pattern sizing can vary considerably from what you're used to wearing. Look on the back of the pattern envelope and determine your size by the ""finished"" measurements it provides.


Most pattern companies follow an international code for sizes.;
, Some patterns are multi-sized. This means that they will be suitable for a wide range of sizes, although they'll usually still provide an indication of the size range. You'll need to look on the pattern itself for the markings of where to cut for each size.

, All patterns contain an allowance for fit, known as ""fit or wearing ease"", or ""designer ease"", assuming they are designed for fabrics that require this allowance.The allowance is not included for garments designed for knit fabrics, since these fabrics have natural stretch. Read the instructions on your pattern to find the allowance or look on the pattern itself for ""finished"" measurements, or something similar.


Compare the difference between the finished measurements and your body measurements in order to find the allowance.
If you don't want the allowance that is included, or if you want to make it smaller or larger, you'll need to look out for this.
This allowance will determine what the final size is for the garment, and indicates whether the garment will fit loosely or closely. Some companies have a standard allowance that corresponds to the descriptions (loose-fitting, fitted, etc.).For beginners it is probably better to ignore all of this, as you may not be ready to alter patterns. If you're unsure, leave in the allowance and take the final garment to a tailor.

, Every pattern comes with step-by-step instructions on a separate sheet (user guide), as well as the pattern template sheet (pattern tissue). You should always read the instructions in the user guide before starting the sewing project so that you're aware of what's expected.


The advice will include how to cut out the template sheet (pattern tissue), how to construct the garment or item, the best way to select sizing, etc.

, Check the pattern instructions to find out if the pattern is with or without seam allowances. If it does not include seam allowances, you'll need to cut the fabric with the seam allowances later. It is more normal for seam allowances not to be included.

, This is a long straight line with arrow heads at one or both ends. This arrow tells you which direction the paper pattern pieces should sit over the grain of the weave (which direction the grain of the fabric needs to go). For stretch fabrics, they might indicate the direction with most stretch.


The grain line of the fabric is the same as the direction of the selvage edges (the white edge where the pattern ends). Simply locate the selvage edge to determine the grain line or direction of the fabric.

, These are the triangular marks on the cutting lines. Use them for matching panels precisely, such as an arm in an armhole. You can get single, double, and triple notches. Pros will make tiny cuts into the seam allowance where these notches are but beginners should cut mirrored triangles beyond the cut line, in order to line up the pattern pieces.


Usually a single notch indicates the front of a garment while a double notch indicates the back. This is not universal, however., These little circles can show where darts, zips, pockets, or gathering are to be added, though they usually indicate where you need to place tacks in order to line up two layers of fabric. Refer to your pattern instructions if you are unsure.


If the pattern does not explain and you see two matching dots on opposite pieces of the pattern, then it is reasonable to assume that these two match up.
Zipper lines are almost always indicated with a zig-zag line.

, Button placement is usually show with an X, while button holes are marked with a bracket line (like the number lines you drew in your math classes), marking the actual size of the button hole.

, These are parallel lines, usually placed very close together, that show where you can increase or reduce the size of the pattern to improve fit. Always read your pattern instructions to understand how to deal with these, as it usually varies between patterns.

, This line is the thick, solid on the outside of a pattern. You should cut along this line. Sometimes it will not be solid and you will see a large number of lines. These indicate that a number of different sizes can be cut, by follow a specific pattern line. Sometimes the size is listed on or near the line, sometimes it is listed in the instructions.

, Sometimes this broken or dotted line is included to indicate where the sewing occurs. It's often left out because there is a standard understanding that the sewing occurs 5/8"" or 15mm inside the cutting line, so if you don't see it, don't panic.

, If you see a large triangle or diamond shape in your pattern, this is usually to indicate a dart. Darts shape a single piece of fabric to make it fit around a curved form.

, These lines, usually clearly labeled on indicated with a special line or bracket, indicate where a piece of fabric should be folded, not cut. Be careful not to cut along this line., Find each pattern piece that you will need to use and cut it out. You will cut the fabric using the solid line on the pattern pieces as a guide.









Use a pair of scissors specifically earmarked for cutting out paper sewing patterns. Keep another pair of 8"" (20.3cm) long scissors specifically earmarked for cutting out fabric. Sewing patterns tend to dull scissors and sharp scissors are needed to easily cut fabric.
If you slip and make a cut where you shouldn't have, simply tape it back into place as best you can. The important thing is that the shape is retained and that you can still read the markings.
You can transfer the final cut-out pattern onto card-stock or cardboard if you want a stiffer pattern to use.

, The user guide will contain a fabric layout guide for each of the items in the pattern pack.


The layouts can vary according to which fabric widths you've chosen and whether the fabric is ""with nap"" or not.The term ""nap"" refers to the up-and-down nature of a print (namely, could the design be cut upside down by accident?).
Pin the pattern pieces to the fabric following the user guide. Usually you will pin the pieces together using 5/8"" (15mm) seam allowance. However, make sure you double-check the seam allowance in the pattern because not all patterns use 5/8"" (15mm). You can also use pattern weights so you won't damage fine or delicate fabric with the needles.
You will now have half of the garment. Have a friend check the fit and help you make any needed alterations in size or length.

, Mark the pattern using tailor's chalk or a tracing wheel and tracing paper. You can also make tape labels for the back of each pattern piece so you won't get confused when you start to sew and don't know what you are looking at.

, The less complicated, the easier it is to learn how to use the pattern. Always read the description on the pattern packaging when deciding whether or not the pattern interests you; it will contain guidance on the item, including suggestions for wearing or use. In addition to the overall description, the details about the garment or item are often on the back of the pattern envelope and will help guide you on fit and style.

, On the pattern you buy you should find an image of the completed item. Most patterns will include a photograph of the completed garment or item on the front of the pattern, with illustrations on the back. If there are variations such as different sleeve lengths, different styles, different collars, etc., the images will usually show these. When trying to get an idea of how a finished garment will look, refer to the photographs over drawings, as they're more realistic.

, On the package, there should be some indicator of difficulty level. Some pattern companies give an indication of the suitability from beginner to advanced. Trust this estimation and don't bite off more than you can chew.

, Don't try anything that needs to be lined with another fabric; that's too advanced for the beginner. Start with simple pieces like A-line skirts or basic tops, and work on things like this until you are very comfortable with your skills.

, On the back of the pattern, you'll be instructed as to which fabric will suit the sewing project. You will note that some patterns suggest a range of fabric types, as well as warnings for fabrics that are not suitable. This gives you leeway to purchase fabric that you like, or that's within budget, etc., as well as forewarning you that you will may have a bad experience if you try to use fabric not suited for the pattern in question!


The amount of fabric will also be noted; this is important as it gives you an indication of the cost if you need to buy it, or can help you to decide whether you've enough fabric at home already.

, These are the extras required to complete the pattern, such as zips, buttons, embellishments, etc. The size, length, and number of such notions is usually made clear.

, Once you're more comfortable using patterns, you'll want to find smarter ways to lay out your pattern and cut the fabric. You can save a lot of money this way, as patterns can often be more than a little generous. Don't worry about this in the beginning though, as you will not have the skills to judge where to cut right away.

, A sewing machine will be much easier and can be crucial for sewing some patterns.








, Hand sewing is also a good skill to have and can make some patterns or parts of patterns easier to sew, if you can build the skill.








, Learning to sew button holes can be a very useful sewing skill.

, Making a professional looking seam is also an important sewing skill.

, Learning how to alter patterns and existing clothes will also be necessary to learn over time.

Ask the salesperson or the in-house repair person about the motor and the gearing.,
Decide what stitches are needed.,
Step on the foot pedal and note the smoothness of operation.,
Feel the weight and note the size of a modern sewing machine.,
Compare the size of the hand wheel of a modern sewing machine to an image of a hand wheel of a sewing machine a century ago.,
Develop a steady and precise control of the foot pedal.,
Choose a sewing machine with the largest knob available.,
Determine whether a commercial sewing machine is worth the investment.",How to Understand the Capability of a Sewing Machine," The motor and gearing for different models might be the same and the cost difference is due to the amount of stitches the expensive machine can do.;
, Besides straight stitching, the zig-zag, double-stitch, button hole, reverse feature, and a handful of other stitches are all that is necessary. From a list of sewing projects you plan to do, sometime maybe, ask which sewing machines could do those projects. Check the stitch quality. When taking a test ""drive"" of the sewing machine determine the quality of the stitching by sewing the straight stitch. A good sewing machine will produce fine, even straight stitches. A poorer quality machine will have uneven or not-so-fine straight stitches.

, An economy sewing machine will have one gear and that gear will be equivalent to a third or fourth gear in a four-speed standard transmission vehicle. The sewing machine will be be erratic at the start and when it reaches a medium-high speed it will run smoothly. A standard car can be operated from the 3rd gear and will be erratic initially and after reaching a moderate speed will run smoothly.

, The machine is compact, made of a lot of plastic and light. The hand wheel will be of great assistance when starting and at lower speeds, but the light machine will be unstable when turning the hand knob (wheel).

, The hand wheel is now so small that it should be more aptly called a hand knob. Hand fatigue will be immediate when assisting the motor when doing fine work and also when sewing through many layers. A belt carrier project, for example, is an extremely demanding job in that as many as eight layers of materials have to be sewed. This is the type of job that without a large diameter hand wheel is very difficult to do and have a nice appearance. A low gear, like the 1st gear in a vehicle, would be desirable for attaching carriers to the waistband.

, The obvious things like bright lighting, concentration, the use of reading glasses and having a helper (to shift the rest of material while the machine operator sews) all help. Fine control of the sewing machine's pedal is best done without footwear, with your ankle in a comfortable angle so fatigue will not compromise the fine control necessary.


The hand knob on the sewing machine has to be used when sewing through thick fabrics or layers. A sewing machine with a big and easy to use hand wheel (like the older sewing machines) is the vital key, for sewing with a machine with high gearing, for highly visible work besides heavy-duty work.

, Jury rig the present knob to make it turn easier or somehow replace the hand knob with a hand wheel. When choosing a sewing machine, beyond the machine having certain quality, having a usable hand wheel is the most important thing to have.

, A commercial sewing machine is costly, so for occasional use in doing sewing that normally require a commercial machine, your economy machine can do it.

, Raise the needle to its highest position., These are usually two plastic pins located on the top or near the base that hold your spools of thread. Locate the stool pins and remove them.

, Insert the spool pin on top of the spool. It is required to keep the spool pins in place.


You only need two spools of thread if you are using two needles.

, Draw out a foot of extra thread with which you will thread the upper portion of the machine. Cut the end of the thread so that it is easier to thread through the needle.

, Bring the thread through the first hole and pull it through the partial hole on the other side. It should be threaded from the bottom through the top of the partial hole and then stretched downward.

, If you are threading two spools of thread, the first one should pass through the right side of the upper thread tension disk and the back spool should thread through the left side of the upper thread tension disk. They will attach to two different needles.

, It should catch on the thread guide lightly as you pull it through and continue downward.

, Then, pass the end of the thread through the eye of the needle. Pull at least four inches (10cm) of thread through the needles.


Note that the thread from a second spool should go from the back spool, to the left side of the tension disk and through the eye of the left needle.

,, This is the metal compartment in which the bobbin or backing thread is stored.

, Many Necchi machines have bobbin cases and you must pull up on the latch to release the bobbin and pull it out.

, This thread color should be chosen to go on the underside of your project. Pull out two inches (five cm) of excess thread from the bobbin.

, The bobbin must turn clockwise, so ensure it is going this direction when you insert it.

, It will go underneath the tension spring. Pull the thread another two inches forward.

, Hold it open. Place the bobbin case onto the center pin in the shuttle race.

, Check to see if the bobbin case is secured. Close the shuttle race cover.

, Turn your hand wheel toward you until the needle goes down through the floor of the machine and up again.

, Pull this thread out further.

Position the spool so that the thread winds clockwise around it.
Pass the thread around the bobbin winding tension disc on top of the machine.;
, Pass the tail end of the thread through the top hole of the empty bobbin.


The thread should pass through the hole from the inside. The tail of the thread should end up on the outside of the bobbin.
Only pass the thread through the upper hole. Do not pass it through the bottom hole.

, Place the bobbin onto the winding shaft, then slide the shaft to the right.


Use your hands to gently twist the bobbin clockwise. After a slight rotation, you should see the spring on the bobbin winding shaft click into the slit along the side of the bobbin.

, Lightly tap your foot on the foot controller of the machine. Allow the the thread to wind around the bobbin a few times.


Hold the tail end of the thread with one hand as you do this.
Take your foot off the controller and stop the machine after the thread is partially wrapped around the bobbin. Do not wait until the bobbin is full before releasing the controller.

, Once the thread is secure on the bobbin, trim the tail coming out from the top hole. Step on the presser foot again to finish winding the bobbin.


The machine should stop on its own once the bobbin is completely full.
Do not touch the balance wheel as the bobbin winds. The wheel will turn during this time, and you should not disturb or attempt to stop it.

, Once the machine stops, cut the thread connecting the bobbin to the rest of the spool.


Push the bobbin winding shaft back to the left and lift the full bobbin off.
Note that if the bobbin is wound improperly, the thread tension could loosen as you sew and break the needle. The thread on the finished bobbin should look tight and even.
This step completes the bobbin winding portion of the process.

, Turn the balance wheel toward you, moving it counterclockwise, until it reaches its highest position.


Raise the presser foot lifter to lift the presser foot, as well.

, Open the shuttle cover to reveal the bobbin case. Pull on the bobbin case latch, pulling the case straight out through the front of the machine.


The shuttle cover is located along the front side of the machine, beneath the needle and behind the extension table.

, Slip the loaded bobbin into the bobbin case so that the thread comes up from beneath the bobbin.


Unwind about 4 inches (10 cm) of thread from the bobbin before attempting to insert it into the case.
Hold the bobbin case so that the latch points down and toward you.
The thread should be directed toward the top of the bobbin case as you slip the bobbin inside. When viewed from the front, the thread should appear to wind around the bobbin in a clockwise rotation. If the bobbin is loaded in the wrong direction, the thread tension will be incorrect and you may end up breaking the machine needle as you attempt to sew.

, Pull the tail of the bobbin thread through the slit at the top of the case. Draw it down and to the left, working it into the delivery eye.


The delivery eye is located just beneath the tension spring of the case.

, Hold the bobbin case by the latch and slip it into the shuttle race of the machine. Release the latch once the bobbin case in in place.


You will need to make sure that your index finger lines up with the top opening of the shuttle race as you push the bobbin case inside.
A properly loaded bobbin case should snap into the machine. It will fall out if placed improperly or insecurely.

, If you have not done so already, lift the presser foot lifter up, releasing the presser foot and bringing it to its highest position.

, If necessary, you should also turn the balance wheel at the side of the machine toward you in a counterclockwise rotation. Continue turning the wheel until the thread take-up lever at the front of the machine is in its highest position.


Only pay attention to the position of this lever; do not worry about the position of the needle.
This lever will be positioned above the needle and should have a small notch in it.

, Lift the spool pin to its vertical position and rest the spool of thread on it.


Position the spool so that the thread appears to wrap around it in a counterclockwise rotation.

, Pull the thread from the spool, drawing it through the rear thread guide at the top of the machine, followed by the front thread guide at the top of the machine.


The rear thread guide is directly next to the bobbin tension disc. Simply slip the thread into the gap of the guide.
The front thread guide is a small notch directly in front of the rear guide. Slide the thread through that notch.
Note that there should be a diagram on the top of the machine to help guide you as you thread the needle.

, Slip the thread down into the right channel at the front of the machine.


At the bottom of the right channel, wrap the thread around the upper tension control dial. The thread should pass from right to left, picking up the thread check spring and slipping into the thread tension discs behind the dial.
Grab the thread on both sides of the tension dial. Gently tug on both sides to make sure that the thread is firmly in place.

, Draw the thread up through the left channel at the front of your machine. Bring it all the way to the back of the channel, then slip it into the eyelet of the thread take-up lever peeking out from inside the channel.


Pull the thread through the eyelet, moving from right to left.
After successfully trapping the thread inside the eyelet, draw the thread back down through the left channel again.

, Slip the thread down and position it behind the wire thread guide just above the needle.

, Insert the thread into the needle. Bring the thread through the front of the eye and out through the back.


Once the thread is successfully inserted through the needle, pull out a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Position this tail behind the needle, pointing toward the back of the machine.

, If the two are not already in their highest positions, take a moment to make sure that both the presser foot and needle are as high as possible.


To raise the presser foot, simply lift up the presser foot lever/lifter.
To raise the needle, turn the balance wheel on the right side of the machine counterclockwise, toward yourself, until the needle sits in its highest position.

, Turn the balance wheel toward yourself again in a full rotation. The needle should move all the way down and all the way back up.


Hold the tail of the upper thread as you do this. Keep the thread taut, but do not put pressure on the needle.
Note that needle must be threaded and the bobbin must be loaded during this process.
During this rotation, the upper thread should catch the lower bobbin thread in a loop.

, Gently tug on the thread inserted through your needle. Continue tugging until the thread looped around it pops up enough for you to grab it.


This extra loop of thread comes from the bobbin.
Once you can grab the loop, pull it out into a straight tail. If you cannot grab it with your fingers, use a small screwdriver, pencil, or similar object to draw the loop out.

, Pull on both pieces of thread until you have tails measuring roughly 6 inches (15 cm) long. Let both of these tails hang off from the back of the sewing machine.


Make sure that the upper thread passes in between the ""toes"" of the presser foot.
With the completion of this step, the Brother LS 2125i sewing machine is fully threaded and ready to use.

Determine what type of machine you have.",How to Thread a Singer Sewing Machine1," The most common Singer machines, no matter what year they were made, have a type of thread guide that falls into one of these categories:


A two-part thread guide is usually composed of a small metal piece and a longer plastic piece, both located on top of the machine. The thread is guided through both pieces before it continues down through the needle.
A single-part thread guide is one guide, typically metal, located at the top of the machine.

, Turn the hand wheel toward you to slowly raise the needle.

, Grasp the small handle on the side of the machine to raise the presser foot so that the thread can pass through the threading points on the machine.

, Some machines have a vertical spool pin, and others have a horizontal spool pin. Either way, secure the thread to the spool pin.

, Lead it through the lower slot on the underside of the thread guide first, then pass it through the upper slot. Lead the thread around to the right and pull it through.

, Pass the thread to the right and under the guide, so that you insert it from the bottom over the top. Carefully snap the thread into place.

, Guide it into the threading channel and let it slip onto the tension discs.

The clutch knob should be located on the right side of your machine.For most models, you will need to hold the outside of the knob still with one hand while turning the inner portion of the knob toward you with the other hand. The outer portion is the hand wheel, while the inner portion is the clutch knob.;
, Situate the spool of thread so that the spool pin of your machine sits in the center hole of your spool.


The thread of the spool should be wrapped around the center in a counter-clockwise rotation.
For most models, the spool pin is vertical. On some models, though, like the Kenmore 385.16120, the spool pin will actually sit in a horizontal position as you wind the bobbin and thread your machine.On the Kenmore 117.591, the spool pin is located at the base of the machine and the bobbin winder, along with its corresponding parts, are located on the front right of the machine.

, Pull thread from your spool and fit it into the small tension disc, usually located near the front top of your machine.


Insert the thread into the disc from the upper right and wrap it around the entire left side, ultimately bringing it back out and to the lower right. Do not wrap it around the disc in a complete rotation.

, Before placing the bobbin on your bobbin winder shaft, insert the thread through the hole in your empty bobbin spool. When done, place the bobbin on the machine's bobbin winder shaft.


Make sure that the bobbin spool is flipped so that the hole appears on the top, rather than the bottom.
The bobbin winder shaft usually lies to the right of your spool pin.
As you place the bobbin on its shaft, make sure that the thread wraps around it a bit from the bottom of the bobbin.

, Firmly push the bobbin and its shaft to the right of the machine until you hear a click.


The bobbin should now be directly next to a bumper. This bumper helps control the amount of thread wound onto the bobbin.

, Hold onto the end of the thread coming out of your bobbin with one hand. Use your foot to press on the machine's power pedal, running the machine as a result. Continue winding the bobbin until the winder stops on its own.


Note that you should also consider snipping off the excess end from the top of the bobbin after you partially fill the bobbin spool. On some models, this excess thread will even snap on its own. This is true for the Kenmore 158.1340, 1345, 1350, and 1355., Push the bobbin winder back to the left and lift the bobbin off. Cut the thread, leaving a small tail behind.

, Hold the outer portion of the hand wheel still while turning the inner clutch knob away from you, in a clockwise rotation. You should feel the clutch tighten up again.


On some models, you can push the hand wheel in to tighten the clutch. This is true for the Kenmore 158.1430, 1431, 1625, 1641, 1940, and 1941., On most models, this can be accomplished simply by pulling it to the left.


The extension table sits at the bottom left front of your machine. It covers the bobbin shuttle, so you'll need to remove it before you can load the bobbin.

, Find the embossed or marked portion on the shuttle cover at the new front of your machine. Pull this part of the cover down to open the cover.


Usually, this embossed handle is located to the left of the cover.
On some models, the shuttle door is actually located just to the front of the needle plate and not on the front of the machine. The door will lift up instead of swinging out. This is true for the Kenmore 1222, 1310, 1311, 1322, and 1422.It's also true of the 1521, 1560, and 1937., Turn the outer portion of the hand wheel toward you. Watch the needle as you turn the wheel, and stop rotating it once the needle reaches its highest point.

, You should see a latch on your bobbin case. Pull this latch toward you to release the case from the shuttle, then pull the case straight out to remove it.


Release the latch once the the case is out of the machine.

, Position the bobbin so that the thread winds around it in a clockwise rotation. Push the bobbin into the case, and weave the end of the thread into the slot located at the top of the case. Continue pushing it through this slot until you can pull the thread under the tension spring.


The tension spring is a little piece held on top of the case with a small screw.

, Lift the latch out once more and push the loaded case back into the shuttle. The latch should face the left of your machine. Release it once the case is back in the shuttle.


You will usually hear a click when you release the latch. Wiggle the case around to make sure that it has been locked in place.

, The take-up lever is a hook located at the left front of the machine, well above the needle. Rotate the outer portion of the hand wheel toward you, in a counter-clockwise rotation, until you see this level reach its highest or most outward point., Find the presser foot lever, usually located just behind and needle and above the pressure foot. Lift it up to lift the pressure foot off the bottom of the machine.

, Situation the spool of thread so that the thread winds in a counter-clockwise rotation and comes off the spool from its back.


As mentioned previously, the spool pin will be vertical for most models, but some models do use a horizontal spool pin.

, This thread guide is located on the top of the machine, toward the back, and usually to the left of the bobbin guide. Wrap the thread around the left side of this guide, drawing it down toward the front of the machine.


You should hold the spool stationary with your right hand while threading this part of the machine. Doing so keeps the thread sufficiently taut and prevents the threading from accidentally coming loose.

, The front of your machine should be marked with an ""A"" path and ""B"" path, or with equivalent labels. Draw the thread down the A path, hooking it into the latch at the bottom of the path, and back up through the B path at the left.


For most models from the Kenmore 158 series and 385 series, there will be a tension knob at the bottom of your first thread path. There are hidden tension discs in between this knob and the machine, and you will need to wrap the thread around the bottom of this knob to insert it in between these tension discs.
For other models, there will be a tension area with a check spring holder located near the front bottom of the machine instead of a tension knob. You will need to wrap the thread around the check spring holder from the back. This is the case for the Kenmore 385.11607 and 12714 models,as well as several other models from the 385 series.
Note that on the Kenmore 117.591, the thread guides and all corresponding parts are located on the left side of the machine and not on the front. The threading process essentially remains the same, though. This is also true of several other models, including the Kenmore 28, 29, 40, 1100, 1101, and 1102., The tension spring should be located at the top of your B path, or just a hair to its left. Pull the thread up and into this spring to secure it in place.

, The front of your machine should have one more marked path. Draw the thread down this path, making sure that it clips into the take-up lever in the process.


You should be able to release the spool at this point.

, Clip the thread into the first lower thread guide at the bottom of the previous thread path. Clip it into the second lower thread guide positioned just above the needle.


This second thread guide will look like a small horizontal pin.

, Weave the end of the thread through the front of the needle and out from the back. Leave a small tail extending out toward the back of the machine.


Note that if the eye of the needle faces side-to-side instead of front-and-back, thread the needle from the left side to the right side., Loosely hold the end of your top thread with your left hand while turning the outer part of the hand wheel clockwise, or toward you. Rotate the wheel a full turn.


Make sure that the presser foot has been raised before doing this.

, You should notice a small loop coming up from the bottom of your needle plate. Gently tug on your upper thread end to straighten this loop and pull the bobbin thread out from within the shuttle.

, Position both thread ends so that they are underneath the pressure foot and pointing toward the back of the machine.


Leave a tail of thread roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) long for both the top thread and bobbin thread.

Note that the sewing machine must be turned on when you wind the bobbin.
If you are using a previously wound bobbin, you can skip this section and consult only the ""Threading the Needle"" and ""Loading and Drawing Up the Bobbin Thread"" sections.;
, Draw the tail of thread from the spool across the top of the machine and around the bobbin winding tension disc on the opposite side.


Make sure that the spool rotates in a clockwise direction as you unravel the thread. If it doesn't, you may need to change the way it sits on the spool pin,
Wrap the thread around the front of the disc first. It should pass over the left side of the disc, then cross back over toward the front of the machine.

, Bring the end of the thread tail up through the hole in the bobbin.


The thread should pass through the hole starting from the inside and moving out through the top.
Draw at least 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of thread through this hole.

, Place the bobbin on the bobbin winding shaft and slide the shaft to the right to lock it in place.Make sure that the tail of thread and its corresponding hole face up.
Carefully turn the bobbin clockwise by hand until you see the spring on the shaft slide into the slit of the bobbin, thereby securing it.

, Hold the tail of the thread and lightly press on the foot controller. Allow the thread to wrap around the bobbin several times, then remove your foot from the controller.


Once the bobbin has been started, trim the tail of thread sticking out from the top of the bobbin.

, Press the foot controller again and allow the bobbin to wind more rapidly. Continue winding until the bobbin is full.


Note that the machine should stop automatically once the bobbin is full.
The balance wheel will continue to turn while the bobbin is being wound, but you should not touch it since doing so could damage the machine.

, Cut the thread connecting the bobbin and the spool, then remove the bobbin from the bobbin winding shaft.


Push the bobbin winding shaft to the left. You should be able to remove the bobbin by lifting it straight off.

, Turn the balance wheel at the right side of the machine until the thread take-up lever in the left front channel reaches its highest position.


Note that the machine should be off at this time to reduce the risk of injury or damage.
Turn the balance wheel counterclockwise, or toward you. Do not turn the wheel away from you.
Raise the pressure foot by lifting the presser foot lever at this time, as well.

, Place the spool of thread on the spool pin at the top of the machine.


You may need to pull up the spool pin before doing this.
Note that the spool of thread should sit so that the tail you remove comes off from the back, rather than the front, causing the spool to spin counterclockwise as it unwinds.

, Pull the thread across the top of the machine and through the upper thread guide before drawing it down into the right front channel.The upper thread guide is the hooked piece of metal attached to the bobbin winding tension disc.
The thread should pass into the right channel at straight angle, not at a diagonal.

, Wrap the thread behind and around the thread tension dial in between the two front channels.


You may need to apply light pressure to the thread above the right channel as you do this.
Wrap the thread around this dial from right to left. Make sure that it picks up the check spring to the left of this dial before continuing.

, Pull the thread up through the left channel, over and through the hook of the take-up lever, then back down the left channel on the other side of the lever.


The thread should be to the right side of the take-up lever before you hook it into that lever. Afterward, it should come back down to the left side of that lever.
The thread should naturally slip into the hook of the take-up lever as you wrap it around the back of that lever.

, Draw the thread down toward the needle, then slip it into the final thread guide just above the needle itself.


This thread guide looks like a small bar standing horizontally across the top of the needle. Slip the thread into the opening of that bar, sliding it into the slot until it reaches the inside bend.

, Draw the thread through the needle, working from front to back.


Leave a tail measuring 2 inches (5 cm) long. Position this tail so that it sits to the back of the machine.

, Turn the balance wheel at the right side of the machine, doing so until the needle reaches its highest position.


Note that the machine should be turned off at this point to minimize the risk of injury or damage.
Only turn the balance wheel toward you, moving it counterclockwise. Do not turn it away from you.
If necessary, raise the presser foot lever at this time, as well.

, Open the shuttle cover and lift the bobbin case out of the machine by pulling on the bobbin case latch.


The shuttle cover should be located behind the extension table and on the front of the machine.
Pull the bobbin case latch toward you. You should feel the case loosen from within the machine. Continue pulling the latch toward you to remove the case from the machine completely.

, Slide the bobbin into the bobbin case and slip the bobbin thread tail through the slot in the case.


Unwind roughly 4 inches (10 cm) of thread before placing the bobbin in its case. This is the tail of thread you'll need to work with in this step.
Hold the bobbin case so that the hook of the latch rests on your thumb. Hold the bobbin so that thread appears to wrap around in a clockwise rotation.
Slip the bobbin into its case with the tail of thread hanging out.
Pull the tail of thread into the natural groove of the case, sliding it until it fits under the spring clip and through the thread guide hole (delivery eye) of the case.

, Hold the bobbin case by its latch again, then insert it back into the machine. Release the latch after the bobbin case locks in place.


The latch of the case should fit into the notch at the top of the shuttle race inside the machine.
If loaded properly, the case should not be able to move around inside the machine.

, Turn the balance wheel at the right side of the machine, moving it toward you (a counterclockwise rotation). The needle must sink into the base of the machine and rise back up to its highest position again.Firmly hold the end of the upper needle thread with your left hand while turning the balance wheel with your right, applying a light amount of tension to that thread in the process.
Do not turn the balance wheel away from you (a clockwise rotation).
If done correctly, the upper thread should catch the lower thread during this process, bringing the lower thread out from the base of the machine in a large loop.

, Use your finger to carefully catch the loop of thread you just pulled up, breaking open the loop in the process.


You should see two separate tails of thread: one extending from the needle (the upper thread) and one extending out from the base of the machine (the lower thread).

, Pull on both threads separately until you have a 6-inch (15-cm) tail of each. Position both tails so that they extend out toward the back of the machine.


Both threads should fall straight behind the presser foot.
The upper thread should pass in between the toes of the presser foot.

, Read through the steps again and check the way that both the top and bottom threads have been prepared. If everything was done correctly, the machine is now threaded and should be ready to use.

Consider first the reasons you want a sewing machine.,
Be honest with yourself: how much time will you actually spend at your sewing machine?,
Consider the above factors when comparing machines.,
Shop around online first.,
Get an idea about what you'll get for your money in various price ranges.,Narrow down your preferred machines to two or three.,
Visit your local sewing shop and ask for a demonstration of each of those machines.,
Compare your budget to the price machine you want, and decide on any compromises or adjustments you will need to make if they don't quite match.,
Price shop online again and check eBay prices.,
Consider whether the personal instruction at the shop is worth the extra $200-500 dollars you'll pay at the shop.,Buy your machine, take the time to learn how to use it, and enjoy.",How to Choose a Sewing Machine," Do you want to sew drapery? Make crafts? Make clothing? Do mending or alterations? Do embroidery or quilting?
,, Sewing machine types and quality range from very basic machines meant for only occasional mending to very high end machines meant for sewing multiple layers of upholstery material and even to machines that will embroider anything you can imagine. The costs will range from around $150 USD to $15000 USD and up., Get a good idea of what is available for what price. If you go to your local shop, you are much more likely to be ""encouraged"" to purchase something more expensive than what you need, not because you need the machine, but because the salesperson needs the commission.,

0-$200 USD: ""Disposable"" machines with plastic cams (parts) that are hard to find/replace. Common brands in this price range are ""Brother"", Some very low end ""Singer"" and ""Kenmore"" brands and some less well known brand names such as Riccar thrown in for good measure. If you're purchasing the machine at a department store such as Kmart or Walmart, this is likely what you are getting.
$200-$600: Average machines which will do well for the occasional seamstress, but will not hold up well long term if you are doing a lot of sewing. (i.e. more than once a week) Good name brands in this price range are Singer, Bernina, White, Janome etc. These machines can occasionally be found in higher end department stores such as Sears or JCPenney.
$700 to $2000: Machines in this price range tend to last longer because they are made from better materials and are engineered better. They also have much better availability of replacement parts for repair. Most good brands will have machines in this price range as well as in the average price range. Mid-range to higher-end Baby Locks, Bernina, Viking Husqvarna, Janome, Juki, Pfaff and a few higher end Singers can be found in this range. Machines in this range are generally not available in department stores and must be purchased either from a sewing shop or online.




 A long-arm quilting machine.

$2000 and up: Machines used by tailors, seamstresses, upholsterers and others who use their machines on an almost daily basis. Machines over $2000 USD tend to be specialty machines such long arm quilting machines, upholstery machines, and embroidery machines. Many sewing shops will rent you time on these machines for a very reasonable fee, saving you the time and expense of purchasing your own (and the space to store them).




 A serger or overlock machine.

The serger, or overlock, machine is another type of specialty sewing machine. It sews with multiple needles and multiple threads to create stitches better suited to stretchy fabrics, such as those used for t-shirts and swimsuits. It is probably not what you want for general purpose sewing. If a serger is the kind of machine you want, they also range from about $200 on up into the low thousands of dollars.

,, You may have to visit different shops for different brands., Will you purchase a used machine? Will you save up for a little longer? Will you chose a slightly lower quality machine?, Often, you can get a fantastic deal on a very lightly used machine if you've done your homework beforehand., If you already know how to sew and you can get a copy of the manual, you may not need to talk to anyone about it to use the machine.,"

Notice that there are two places to adjust the tension.,
Begin by looking at the stitch by sewing a line on a scrap piece of material.,
Test the stitch again.",How to Correct the Tension on a Sewing Machine," The dial on the front of the machine is to adjust the tension of the top thread. There is a screw in the bobbin housing (under the footplate) to adjust the tension of the bobbin (bottom) thread. Experiment adjusting the tension. When the tension is perfect, the stitch will meet in the middle of the cloth; the stitch looks the same on top as it does on the bottom.;
, If the top thread is lying flat and the bottom thread is coming right through, then the bobbin tension is too loose. Tighten the screw slightly in the bobbin housing (the little metal piece that you put the bobbin into). If the thread is lying flat along the bottom of the fabric and the top thread is going all the way through, then the top tension is too loose. Make sure that the pressure foot is in the lowered position and then adjust the dial slightly at the front of the machine.

, Keep adjusting by small increments. Keep testing until the tension is perfect.

Try it on.",How to Make a Hood," The base garment is the item of clothing you wish to attach the hood to. It can be a coat, jacket, sweater, shirt, or dress.


Ideally, the garment should have a neckline that sits comfortably around the base of your neck. It can have a solid, buttoned, or zippered front.;
, The fabric for your hood should coordinate with the base garment in both pattern and fiber content.


If you're making a hood for a garment you're in the process of sewing, use the same fabric for both the hood and the garment.
If you're making a hood for a prepared garment you already have in your possession, choose new fabric that looks and feels similar. If you cannot match the pattern, try to match at least one color within the pattern. Similarly, if you cannot find the same type of fabric, choose one that is similar in weight.
Note that woven fabrics will work if you're adding the hood to a garment made with woven fabric and if the neckline opens at the front or breaks into a deep v-neck. Otherwise, you may need to use knit fabric.
Also note that you can use the same material for both the exterior portion of the hood and the lining. If you choose to mix and match, though, you should keep both fabrics similar in weight and stretch.

, Use a tape measure to carefully measure all the way around the neckline of the base garment.


If the neckline opens in the front, start and stop the measurement at the edge of that opening.
The bottom of both hood halves will need to be half the circumference of the neckline.
If you do not have a base garment to work with, you can estimate the necessary circumference by measuring around the circumference of the wearer's neck. Add at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) to this measurement to prevent the hood from fitting too snug.

, On a large sheet of blank newsprint or brown package paper, draw a straight line that matches half the circumference of your neckline.


Since the back of a garment typically rises higher than the front, the left edge of this bottom line should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) lower than the right edge.

, This opening should be at least as tall as the distance between the top of your head and the front of your collarbone.


Usually, the front opening will be around 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the bottom edge for child-sized hoods and between 3 and 5 inches (7.6 and 12.5 cm) for adult-sized hoods.
Draw this line so that it extends straight up from the left end of the bottom edge.

, The back curve will need a relatively flat top and side, but it should curve instead of meeting at a sharp angle.


To make the process easier, draw one straight line extending to the right of the top front opening and a second extending up from the right end of the bottom edge. Continue until these two lines meet at an intersection.

Starting within 3 inches (7.6 cm) of the point of intersection, lightly sketch a curve to the inside of the sharp corner. This new curve will be the final outline of the back curve.


Note that the total length of this curved line should roughly match the distance between the wearer's shoulders and the top of the wearer's forehead., Draw a second outline around the first, placing it approximately 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to the outside.


You'll need to add this seam allowance to all sides of the hood pattern.

, Cut out the pattern piece, then pin or trace it onto the fabric for your hood.


You can save time by folding the fabric and pinning it together.

If you plan to use the same material for the exterior and the lining, fold the fabric into four layers and pin the pattern piece to the top layer.
If you plan to use different material for the exterior and the lining, fold both pieces of fabric in half to create two layers. Stack one on top of the other, and pin the pattern piece on top of the first layer.



, Carefully cut around the marked pattern.


When finished, you should have four separate pieces of material.
For single-sided fabric, make sure that there are two sets of two matching halves. In other words, you should be able to match up the edges of two separate pieces, and the ""wrong"" sides of both pieces should face one another as you do.

, Find a garment with a hood that fits well. Fold the hood of this garment in half.


Ideally, the garment should be similar in size to the garment you plan to add the hood to. Line up the necklines. If the necklines of both garments do not match, you may need to alter the bottom edge of your pattern so that it matches the neckline of your base garment.

, With the left and right sides folded together, lay the hood flat over plain newsprint or brown package paper. Use a pencil to sketch around the front and back edges of the hood.Fold the hood down along its bottom seam, then trace along that edge, as well.
If you need to add or remove length, begin by adjusting the bottom edge as needed. After adjusting the bottom, bring the front opening forward or backward as needed to meet the altered length.

, Sketch a second outline around the first outline, spacing the two 1/2 inch (2.5 cm) apart. This new space will be the seam allowance.


Note that you'll need to cut along the seam allowance outline. Do not cut over the original outline.

, Cut out the pattern piece, then lay it over your fabric. Pin it in place or sketch around the full outline with fabric pencil.


Fold the fabric into four layers and pin the pattern piece on top. If you're using two separate materials for the exterior and the lining, fold each material into two layers and pin them together with the pattern piece on top.
The ""wrong"" side of the fabric should face up on half the layers and down on the other half.

, Cut around all edges of the marked pattern.


When finished, remove the pins and separate the pieces. You should have a total of four separate pieces.

, Pin both exterior pieces together, ""wrong"" sides facing out and ""right"" sides facing in. Using a sewing machine, straight stitch along the curved top-to-back edge.


Remember to use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance along the edge.
Use an iron to press the seam allowance to one side when finished.

, Pin both lining pieces together, ""wrong"" sides out and ""right"" sides in. Straight stitch along the curved top-to-back edge.


Use the same 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance and press it to one side of the material when finished.
Note that the lining and exterior portions of the hood should match in shape and size.

, Open both pieces, then lay them together with the ""right"" sides in and the ""wrong"" sides out. Pin the pieces together and sew a straight stitch along the front portion of the perimeter.


The outer perimeter will correspond to the front and bottom edges of the hood. Stitch the front edges together, using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance, but do not sew the bottom edge closed.
If desired, you can also top stitch down the center line of the hood, but doing so is not necessary.

, Turn the hood right-side out through the bottom opening.


If necessary, use an iron to press and flatten the joined front edge of the hood.

, Pin the hood to the neckline of the base garment, matching up the center and endpoints precisely.The base garment should be right-side out and the hood should be lining-side out. Fold the hood over and around the top of the garment so that the exterior side of the hood faces the outside of the garment.
Begin by matching the bottom center of the hood with the back center of of the garment's neckline. Fold the sides of the hood over, matching the corners to the center front of the neckline.
Once the center and endpoints are pinned in place, continue pinning around the rest of the bottom edge to secure the hood evenly around the neckline.

, Sew a straight stitch from one endpoint and around the back of the neckline, stopping only when you reach the other endpoint.


Use the same 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance used on your other hood edges.
When finished, the bottom edge of the hood should be firmly attached to the neckline of the garment.

, Work back over the exposed raw edge of the hood with a zigzag stitch.


Place the stitch as close to the raw edge as possible. The threads of this stitch should lock the edge in place and prevent it from fraying as you wear the hood.

, The project is now complete. Put on the garment and flip the hood over your head to test it out and admire your own handiwork.

They are various loops that you run the thread through before looping it into your needle. They keep the thread from getting tangled and distribute the tension evenly from the spool to your fabric., The tension discs and tension regulator together are called the tension assembly. The tension discs squeeze the thread as it passes between them, while the tension regulator controls the amount of pressure on the discs. The tension regulator is elementary: when adjusted to a higher number (turned clockwise), the discs move closer together, increasing the pressure. Turned to a lower number (counterclockwise), the discs move apart, decreasing pressure.On older machines there are only two tension discs, controlled by a screw or knob. On newer models there are three discs controlled by a dial or keypad on the front of the machine.
Unless you have a newer machine that makes automatic upper-tension adjustments, using a thicker thread without resetting the dial will increase the pressure and cause the upper thread flow to decrease.

, The flat bobbin-case spring exerts pressure on the thread as it comes out of the bobbin case. You can either have a loading drop in bobbin (you won’t have a bobbin case), or bottom loading with a bobbin case in a compartment below the needle. The amount of pressure on the bobbin is regulated by a small screw at the rear of the spring.


Both the spring and screw are easy to locate when the machine has a separate bobbin case. When the machine has a drop-in bobbin with a built-in bobbin case, locating the tension screw can be more challenging but a little bit of searching will prove it’s there.
In either case, to increase the resistance, use a small screwdriver to turn the screw clockwise (to a higher number) or counterclockwise (to a lower number). Turn the screw in small increments and never more than a quarter-turn between tests.

, Tension is what keeps your bottom and top stitches in equal tension with one another. In other words, it is what keeps your front and back stitches looking the same. Both the top and bottom tension must work together in order to create consistent stitching. If your top and bottom stitches aren’t even, it may be due to your tension not being right on the top or bottom.Most domestic sewing machines are of the ""lockstitch"" variety. That means an upper thread and a lower thread ""lock"" together. When they don’t “lock” together properly, you could have an issue with the tension.

, Using a small swatch of fabric, run a couple of seams down the middle of the square. Observe the top and bottom surface of the seams, using a magnifying glass if need be.


Remember you want your stitches to look even on both sides of your fabric. If the thread is so tight it’s causing the fabric to bunch around it or if the stitching is loose and falling apart, you might have an issue with the tension.
If your stitches look perfect and your sewing machine is sewing wonderfully, don’t touch your tension knobs!

, You’ve sewn a test seam or two and you’ve inspected the seams. A perfect stitch will have threads locked midway between the two layers of cloth, with no loops on the top or bottom of the seam and no puckers in the cloth.An easy way to think of the thread balance is tug of war. You have your top thread and your bobbin thread pulling on each side. If they’re both pulling equally, the seam will be even and consistent. If one side is pulling too much, the thread from the other side will be visible.
If the bobbin thread shows on the top side of the seam and the top thread is straight, the upper tension is too tight. If top thread shows on the underside of the seam and the lower thread is straight, the upper tension is too loose., There are multiple problems that could be causing issues with your sewing machine that aren’t the tension. Make sure to check these possible causes before adjusting your tension knobs.Incorrectly threaded machine: Is all of the thread running through the thread guides? Is thread unwinding freely from the spool or is it catching? Is the bobbin inserted correctly?
Dirty machine: Thread ends can get lodged between tension discs, around the bobbin case, and under the throat pale. This can cause an increase in resistance and restrict the thread flow. Check all of these areas to ensure they’re clear.
Damaged machine parts: Bent needles and bobbins and rough or damaged surfaces on the needle eyes, thread guides, tension discs, take-up lever, throat plate, presser foot, bobbin case, or in the bobbin area can all cause problems. Give your machine a general inspection and remember that even the tiniest damage can distort tension.

, Different thread sizes on the top and in the bobbin can throw off your basic tension settings. A needle that is too large or too small can also unbalance your stitches. If you’re getting puckers on a lightweight fabric, trying shortening the stitch length to 1.75mm. All of these small details can wreak havoc on your project so make sure you’re detail-oriented when setting up your machine for a project.


Polyester thread is a a true all-purpose thread, and it’s a good choice for most sewing projects. Wool thread, on the other hand, is very thick and if you were to use it, you'd have to adjust your tension.Common heavy duty fabrics include canvas and burlap while cotton and polyester are common fabrics with a standard weight. If you’re switching between heavy fabrics and something of a lighter weight, you’d have to adjust your tension to keep the stitches even.Needles come in various sizes for different purposes. There are thicker needles designed for denim that won’t break when they’re being used and thin needles that won’t damage thin, delicate fabrics. When buying needles, you can consult someone in the store to help you find the best option for your fabric., It will be in a different place on every machine so if you’re not sure which knob it is, you can check your sewing machine manual. If you don’t have a manual, it is the knob with numbers on it that doesn’t change your type or stitches or length.

, To increase your top tension if it’s too loose, turn your knob so that the numbers are increasing. Try ½ to 1 number lower, then test the stitches on a piece of scrap fabric. Continue until it looks even on both sides and you can no longer see the bottom thread on the top.If you are unable to get it completely even, proceed to adjusting the bobbin tension.

, To decrease your top tension if it is too tight, turn your knob so the numbers are decreasing. Try ½ to 1 number lower, then test the stitches on a piece of scrap fabric. Continue until it looks even on both sides and you can no longer see the bottom thread on the top.If you are unable to get it completely even, proceed to adjusting the bobbin tension.

, You should always try to adjust your top tension first because you shouldn’t need to adjust your bobbin tension unless you are using a heavier or lighter thread than usual. If you’ve done that and still need to adjust the lower thread, locate your bobbin in either the top loading drop in bobbin (you won’t have a bobbin case), or bottom loading with a bobbin case.


With a bottom loading bobbin, an easy way to test the tension is to take the thread hanging from your bobbin case in your hand. If it doesn’t unwind at all, your tension is too tight and needs to be loosened. If the thread unwinds with no effort, your tension is too loose and you’ll need to tighten it. You want to hold the thread and have it drop just a few inches. When that happens, your tension is perfect.Use a tiny screwdriver and turn the screw on the side of the bobbin case by ¼ turn. Turn it right to increase the tension and left to decrease it. Test the tension again. Repeat until the thread only drops a few inches.
Similarly, with a top loading bobbin, you use a screwdriver and turn the screw by ¼ turn, testing your tension between each adjustment with a test seam on scrap fabric. The good old righty tighty lefty loosey applies in this situation as well.

, Keep sewing test patches until your tension is right and you’ve got even stitches on both sides. Once you’re happy with the tension, finish setting yourself up, and start your project!

Be sure that your needle is not bent and that it is inserted completely and screwed down tightly.
Check that your needle, thread weight, and fabric are compatible. A heavier fabric requires a larger needle and thicker thread. ;
, By testing the alignment of the needle and the shuttle hook, you can determine whether your machine needs a timing adjustment. 








Leave the needle threaded, but remove the switchplate, base cover(s), and bobbin case.
Turn the hand wheel slowly to ensure that the shuttle hook is smoothly catching the thread. If it does not, you may need to adjust the timing.
Use a ruler to measure the timing settings. Use the hand wheel to put the needle in the lowest position, then raise it 3/32 of an inch. The shuttle hook should meet the needle just above the eye while it is in this position. If it does not, you may need to adjust the timing.

, If you have determined that you need to adjust the timing, be sure you are ready to work on your machine.









You may need move the stitch position to a straight stitch, ensuring that the needle descends through the center of the switchplate hole, or you may need to move your needle to the widest zigzag position. Check with your manufacturer’s guidelines.
If you haven’t already, remove the needlebar cover, the switchplate, the bobbin, and the cover from the base of the machine. Gather any tools you may need, such as a small screwdriver, sewing machine oil, and a bright work light.

, Most machines have marks on them that indicate the appropriate height for the needlebar. Consult your manual for specifics on how to access and loosen your needle bar.









If timing marks are present, loosen the needlebar and slide it up or down to align the top timing mark just below the bottom of the timing bar bushing.
If timing marks are not present, lower the needle completely with the hand wheel, then raise it 3/32 of an inch (2.4mm). Adjust the needle’s height so that the needle eye is 3/32 of an inch below the point of the hook. , Adjusting the hook timing varies between manufacturers and models. The general approach, however, is to adjust the distance between the hook and the needle.









Using the handwheel, lower the needlebar to its lowest position.
Loosen the gears in the base of the machine.
Make adjustments until the hook and needle are an appropriate distance apart, anywhere from 0.04mm to 0.1mm or 0.01-0.16, depending upon the machine.

, By re-testing the alignment of the needle and the shuttle hook, you can determine whether your adjustments have improved the machine’s settings.









If you removed the thread from the needle, re-thread it. Continue to work with the bobbin area exposed.
Turn the hand wheel slowly to ensure that the shuttle hook is smoothly catching the thread. If the hook catches the thread every time, your timing has been fixed.

, Carefully tighten all screws securely, and be sure there are no “leftover” parts that have not been replaced.

, 








Remove any lint or debris from gears and feed dogs.
Consult your manual to find the specific areas that require oiling.
Only use sewing machine-specific oil on your sewing machine.

,, Re-thread your machine and sew a test piece of material.









The stitches should be even, with no skipped stitches or broken needles.
If the problem has not resolved, you may need to make further adjustments or consult a sewing machine repair person.

If you find the metal plate where the needle pushes through with the thread, then you should see the shuttle cover on one side of the machine., The bobbin casing is located just inside the shuttle cover. It will look like a metal cylinder., Slide out the bobbin. If your bobbin is secured within the casing, then you may have to open the casing first., The spool pin is a piece on your sewing machine that holds the thread while you wind the bobbin. It will be a cylindrical piece that fits the hole in the spool of thread.The spool pin is commonly located on the top or side of the machine.

, Start the spool or remove the end of the thread from the hook so that you can easily transfer thread from the spool once it's secured to the spool pin.

, The spool pin should fit through the center of your thread.


If it has a spool cap, place that on top of the thread to hold it in place.
If your machine’s spool pin is on top of the machine, it may not have a spool cap.

, Most machines have a piece with a small hole near the spool that helps you guide the thread either when winding a bobbin or when threading the machine. If your machine does not have a thread guide, then skip this step., Your machine will have a small metal piece that will convey the thread as it’s wound around the bobbin. This piece should be near the thread guide and will look like a tiny knob., Your thread should form a triangle when held taut, with the top of the triangle located at the tension disk. Don't let go of your thread., Your bobbin should have a tiny hole in the side. Some bobbins have several. Push the end of your thread through the hole in your bobbin. You only need to push the thread through one hole on one side.If your bobbin has more than one hole in it, you can use any of the holes.

, The bobbin winder is a cylindrical metal piece that looks similar to the spool pin and is about the size of the hole in the center of your bobbin. Next to the bobbin winder, you should see a round plastic piece., Line up the bobbin winder with the hole in the center of the bobbin and push the bobbin down onto the winder., Push the bobbin winder toward the plastic disk next to the winder. When the your winder is securely in place, you should hear a click., As you start to wind the bobbin, hold the end of the thread that you looped through the hole in your bobbin to keep it from slipping back out., Continuing working your pedal as your bobbin fills with thread. Move at a comfortable speed.You may want to start by pushing your pedal slowly to find your rhythm, but there’s no reason to wind your bobbin at a slow speed.
If your bobbin fills unevenly, you have likely wound your thread around the tension disk in the wrong spot. Check your placement of the thread. If you believe you have done it correctly, then wrap it a second time to ensure that your thread is winding evenly.If your thread catches on the notch of the spool, try turning the spool over and working in the opposite direction of that notch.

, You may be unsure of how much thread you’ll use, but it’s a good idea to fill up your bobbin each time you wind it so that you don’t run out of thread.Your bobbin is full when you reach the edges of the sides of the bobbin, making your thread flush with the outside edge. If you keep loading your bobbin past the sides, then the thread will slide off and unwind.

, Use your scissors to disconnect the thread between your bobbin and the spool. Be careful to not let go of the end of your thread on the bobbin so that it doesn’t start to unwind., You will again hear a click when the winder is securely in place., Your bobbin is now full of thread and ready to use."

, This is a small plastic or metal pin that sticks out of the top of the sewing machine, and holds your spool of thread.

, The thread guide directs thread from the spool on the top of the machine to the bobbin winder. It is a geometric metal piece that sticks out of the top of the sewing machine on the left side.

, To the right of the spool pin on top of the sewing machine is another smaller plastic or metal pin, next to a small horizontal wheel. This is the bobbin winder and the bobbin winder stopper. These work together (with the spool of thread) to wind thread onto your bobbin prior to starting sewing.

, These are in different locations depending on the specific sewing machine you have, but there is typically a small screen next to a few physical buttons on the front side of the sewing machine. These buttons select the type of stitch you create, the length of the stitch, and the direction of the stitch (forward or in reverse). Check the manual for your specific machine to determine the functions for each of the buttons.

, When you’re ready to thread your sewing machine, you will wind the thread from the spool on top, through the thread guide, and then around the takeup lever. This is the lever (with two cut-in grooves) located on the front left side of the sewing machine. There are typically numbers and arrows printed next to it to clearly direct you the way in which to thread the machine.

, The tension dial is a small numbered wheel near the takeup lever. It controls the tension of the thread as you sew; if the tension is too tight, the needle will be pulled to the right. If the tension is too loose, the thread will loop on the bottom of the fabric you are sewing.

, This is a metal piece that holds the needle in place while sewing. It is located under the arm of the sewing machine, looks similar to a large nail, and sticks out to the right side of the needle.

, This is a metal attachment under the needle clamp screw that looks like a small ski. When engaged, this holds the fabric in places and guides it through the sewing machine as you sew.

, It will be a lever to the right or back of the needle assembly. To adjust the presser foot, move it all the way down and all the way up.

, the needle plate is the silver plate just below the needle. Simple enough, huh?

, The feed dog (silly name, right?) is a small metal guide under the presser foot on the needle plate that moves the fabric through the machine as you sew. You can find it by looking for the two small metal rows underneath the presser foot.








, The bobbin is a small spool of thread that is supplied from the bottom of the sewing machine, and supplies thread to the needle for the backing. Under the metal plate where the needle is is the bobbin cover, and next to that there should be a cover release button or pin. You’ll use this to put the bobbin in place before sewing.







, Sit in a chair that is a comfortable height for the height of the table. Arrange the machine so that the needle end is on your left and the body of the machine is on the right. You will be checking a couple of things first and getting to know the machine a bit, so don't plug it in just yet.

, Needles have a flat side, so they can only go one way, usually with the flat side toward the back. There is a groove down one side of the needle, generally opposite the flat side of the shank––this groove must be facing the direction from which the needle is threaded when installing the needle (the thread rides in this groove while going up and down through the fabric.) Insert a needle all the way into the post and tighten the thumbscrew securely.If you are still having trouble, refer to your machines manual.








, A machine uses two thread sources, a top thread and a lower thread, stored on a bobbin. To wind the bobbin, place the bobbin spool on the bobbin winder on the top. Follow the guides, and wrap the thread from the thread spool around the guide and to the bobbin. Turn the bobbin winder on, and wait for it to stop automatically when the bobbin is full.









When the bobbin has been wound, place it in the bobbin cage below the needle on the lower half of the sewing machine. Sometimes the bobbin simply drops in (the bobbin case is built in). In this case it is important to pass the thread through a small notch at the front of the case and then pulled to the left. Leave the end of the thread outside. It will need to be brought up through the hole in the needle plate after you have threaded the top thread.
Follow the link above for detailed instructions on winding and inserting a bobbin.

, The spool of thread resides on the top of the sewing machine, but must be unwound and attached to the needle. To do this, take the thread and pull it through the thread guide at the top, and then down and around the takeup lever. There should be small numbers and arrows printed on the machine showing the way in which to thread the machine.









You may also be able to follow the guides printed on your machine.
Usually, the thread follows this general pattern: ""left, down, up, down, into a hook, through the needle."" Another way to know how to thread the machine is ""Spool pin, tension, take-up lever, needle, using thread guides provided between these parts"".
The needle might be threaded from the left, the right, or from front to back. If it is already threaded, that is a clue to the direction; if not, the last thread guide before the needle, is located nearest to the direction from which you must thread the needle.

, Hold the needle thread taut, and towards you in your left hand. With your right hand, make one complete needle down/up revolution by turning the hand wheel toward you. Now pull up on the needle thread that you are still holding with your left hand. The bobbin thread was caught when the threaded needle went down and up and is now looped over the needle thread. Pull on one side of the loop to bring up the bobbin thread tail, or just release the needle thread and pass a pair of scissors between the presser foot and plate to pull the looped bobbin thread out. You should now have the ends of two threads, one from the needle and one coming up from below from the bobbin.








, Many sewing machines have a built-in light, which is often a good way to tell whether there is power to the machine. The power switch will usually be on the right side or back of the machine, if there is one. Some machines don't have a separate switch, in which case they're turned on as soon as they're plugged in.Plug the pedal into the machine, too. Place the pedal in a comfortable spot under your feet.

, Consult your manual for how to do this on your machine. On this machine, stitches are set by rotating the lower knob on the right side of the machine until it clicks into place. Always set the stitch with the needle up and out of the fabric, since it may move the needle.









A straight stitch is used to sew most seams. The next most common stitch is the zigzag, usually used to prevent edges from fraying.

, Choose a simple, woven material, not a knit one, for your first sewing experience. Don't use a very heavy fabric for your first attempts at machine sewing. Denim and flannel can be hard to sew because they are too thick when several layers are piled together.

, Sew with the bulk of the material to the left of the machine; crowding the bulk on the right side can cause messy stitching.

, There is a lever behind or to the side of the needle assembly that raises or lowers the presser foot.









If you give the fabric a gentle tug while the presser foot down, you'll feel that the machine grips it pretty firmly. While you sew, the machine uses a feed dog under the presser foot to advance the fabric at the correct speed. There's no need to pull the fabric through the machine; in fact, pulling can bend the needle or damage your project. You can adjust the speed and the stitch length on the machine.

, For the first few stitches, you'll need to hold these ends to keep them from retreating into the fabric. After you've stitched for a short distance, you can let go and use both hands to control the fabric and the machine.








, The foot pedal is your speed control. Just like the gas pedal in a car, the harder you push it, the faster you will go. Push it slowly at first, just enough to get the machine going.









Your machine may have a knee bar rather than a foot pedal. If that's the case, use your knee to push it to the right.
You can use the balance wheel on the top, right side of the machine to get the machine spinning or to move the needle by hand.
The machine will advance the fabric automatically away from you. You can ""steer"" the fabric in a straight line or a curve by guiding it through the machine with your hands. Practice sewing in a straight line and try sewing some curves. The only difference is how you guide the fabric.
Do not force the material or pull the material while it is going under the needle. This can cause the material to stretch or the needle to break, or the stitches to clog up in the bobbin. If you feel like the fabric is not moving fast enough, press the foot pedal harder, adjust the stitch length, or (if you must) buy a faster machine.

, It reverses the direction that the machine feeds, so that the fabric travels toward you as the machine sews. Often, this button or lever is spring-loaded, so you must hold it down to sew in reverse.









At the end of a seam, sew a few stitches in reverse back over the last few stitches you just made. This finishes the seam and helps keep it from pulling out.

, Then, raise the presser foot. The fabric should pull out easily. If the thread pulls back when you try to remove the fabric, check the needle position.








, On many machines, there is a small notch on the back of the post that holds the presser foot. You can hold both ends of the thread and draw it down over this notch to cut the thread. If you don't have such a notch or you would like a cleaner cut, use scissors to trim the thread. Leave a tail extending from the machine for your next seam.








, Pin two pieces of fabric, right sides together, near the edge. The seam will go 1/2 inch (1.3cm) to 5/8 inch (1.5cm) from the edge. You can sew a single layer of fabric (and might do so to stop an edge from fraying, say), but since the goal of most machine sewing is to join two pieces of fabric, you should get used to sewing with a couple of layers and pins.









Fabric is pinned right sides together so that the seam allowance will end up on the inside. The ""right"" side is whichever side of the fabric you will want on the outside when the piece is done. On printed fabric, it is generally the side with brighter colors. Solids may not have an obvious right side.
Place the pins perpendicular to the line where the seam will go. You can sew right over straight pins, and still remove them later with no damage to the machine, the fabric, or the pins. It is safer to remove pins just before stitching reaches them, as accidentally striking a pin will break, or at least dull the needle. Avoid sewing over the heads of the pins, however.
While you're looking at the fabric, notice which way the fabric itself goes. Seams may go any direction, but most sewing projects are cut so that the main seams go parallel with the lines of the weave. Also note the direction of the print if your fabric has one, and arrange it so it will be ""right side up"" such as with a floral or animal print or so that stripes or other patterns run a certain direction.

, Use the hand wheel at the top of the right side of the machine to move the needle to the top of its travel before starting a seam and again to remove the fabric from the machine at the end of a seam. This lifts the needle, and allows you to move to another area of the fabric you’re working on.









If the needle is not at the top of its travel, the thread may not move when you pull on the ends.
Look for lines on your sewing machine indicating seam allowance. This is the ""normal"" space between the edge of the fabric and the stitching line. Generally, you should use the line at 5/8"" (1.5cm) or 1/2"" (1.3cm). Use a ruler measure on either side of the needle. This should already be marked on your machine's ""throat plate"" (the flat metal piece that the needle goes through). If not, mark it yourself with masking tape.

, Where you want to turn the corner, lower the needle all the way into the fabric. You can use the hand wheel to lower the needle. Raise the presser foot. Leave the needle down, in the fabric. Then, Rotate the fabric to the new position, leaving the needle in it. Finally, lower the presser foot with the fabric in the new position and resume sewing.







, When you have made an assortment of test seams and start to feel comfortable with the basics, try sewing a pillow, pillowcase, or cloth gift bag.

Remove the bobbin.",How to Thread a Sewing Machine1," This can usually be done with one full rotation of the hand-wheel on the side of the machine. Do this so that your needle won't be flailing wildly while you wind the bobbin.






;
, The bobbin is a small spool that is located under the sewing needle in your machine. It supplies the underside portion of the machine stitch, but doesn’t come prepared with thread. Remove the covering above the bobbin and take it out of its case; it should be empty of thread.








, Place your spool of thread on the top of the sewing machine, on the spool pin. The spool should be turned so that the thread is released counter-clockwise.








, Tug at the thread to pull it out, and wind it around the bobbin winding tension disc at the top of the sewing machine. If you have a newer sewing machine, there will likely be a diagram at the top guiding you through this process.








, Hold the bobbin up and wrap the thread around it 2-3 times.








, This is a small pin that is likely on the top of your machine. Slide the pin over to lock the bobbin in place for winding.








, As you hold the longer thread entering the bobbin, start winding the bobbin for a few seconds by pushing the floor pedal or press the bobbin winding button. Doing this will make sure the thread is securely wrapped around the bobbin. Then, cut off the excess thread on the short tail end that is sticking out.








, Apply pressure to the floor pedal again or flip the winder back on and allow it to completely fill the bobbin with thread. Likely, your winder will stop on its own when the bobbin is full; the bobbin should still be able to spin easily when full.








, Slide the bobbin pin over and remove the bobbin. The thread will still be attached to the thread spool as well as the bobbin, so cut the excess with a pair of scissors, leaving a 2–3 inch (5.1–7.6 cm) tail. You’re ready to start threading your machine now!

"
Measure the height of your sewing machine.,
Measure the width.,
Measure the depth.",How to Make a Sewing Machine Cover1," Place your sewing machine on a hard, flat surface. Use a tape measure to measure the distance from this surface to the top of your sewing machine. Write this measurement down.


Note that any retractable spool pins should be pushed down, along with any other retractable or removable sewing machine accessories that might change the height of your machine. Keep the machine in the state it will usually be in during storage.

, With the sewing machine facing you normally, use your tape measure to measure from the right side to the left side of the machine. Write the measurement down.


It's important that you measure from the furthest extended portions of the machine. This measurement needs to include the entire base of your machine as well as the flywheel along the upper side. Any other element that sticks out on the left or right side must also be accounted for.

, Use your tape measure to measure the distance from the front of the machine to the back. Write this measurement down, as well.


Make sure that the nearest portion of the front and the furthest portion of the back are both accounted for in the measurement, even if one side sticks out more at a particular area than the other side does.
Try to hold the tape measure straight as you measure instead of bending it around the curves of the sewing machine.

"
"
Re-engage the needle.,
Unwind a few inches of thread from the bobbin.,
Drop the bobbin into place.,
Begin winding the thread.,
Pull the thread down.,
Wrap the thread around the takeup lever.,
Thread the needle.,
Expose the bobbin thread.",How to Thread a Sewing Machine2," Now you can prepare the machine to actually sew. The main spool of thread will stay in the same spot on top of the machine. The bobbin's home is under a small door that is either directly below or to the side in front of your needle. Find this chamber and open it.








, (Note that in the pictures, the example shows switching over to a teal colored thread on the bobbin, just so you can differentiate between bobbin thread and spool thread.)








, There should be a cutout that you will lay the bobbin thread into. In some machines, there is a C-shaped loop with a blade at the end to cut off the thread. Orient it such that if you pulled on the thread, the bobbin would spin counter-clockwise. You should be able to pull on the tail of thread to the right and the thread should unwind fairly easily. Close the cover over the bobbin when you finish.








, Pull the thread from the spool on the top of the sewing machine. Pull the thread through the thread guide on the top of the machine - a silver piece that is sticking out the top. There will likely be printed guidelines on the top of the machine diagramming how to do this.








, Follow the directional arrows on your sewing machine by pulling the thread through the guide and towards you. You will be looping it around the tension discs on the bottom, and then back up towards the top along the second thread guide. This will ultimately create a long, narrow “U” shape with your thread.







, After you’ve completed the “U” shape, you will wind the thread around the takeup lever at the top and back down towards the needle. The take-up lever is a metal piece sticking out of the second thread guide. This metal piece will have a hole cut out near the top that the thread needs to go through. Completing this motion will create a large, narrow, sideways “S” with the thread.








, Pull the thread back down the machine towards the needle. Thread the needle through the small eye near the bottom. The thread should then be pulled through the small metal presser foot directly underneath it.








, The bobbin thread is still hiding under the plate below the needle. To bring out the end of it, grab the round dial

"
Choose a cloth large enough to drape over the machine.,
Pin back any excess fabric.,
Hem the edges.,
Cut four pieces of ribbon.,
Hem the ribbon ends.,
Pin the ribbon in place.,
Sew the ribbon on.,
Put the sewing machine cover on your sewing machine.",How to Make a Sewing Machine Cover2," A decorative tea cloth, pillowcase, or cloth placemat usually works well.


The width of the cloth must at least measure the width of the machine. The length of the cloth must equal the height of the machine times two, plus the depth of the machine (height + height + depth). Your cloth can be a little larger, but do not use a smaller piece of material.
You can verify the size of your cloth by simply draping it over the machine so that it covers the machine from front to back. Note that the left and right sides will not be covered.;
, Drape the fabric over the sewing machine with the right side facing you, so that it covers the machine from the front to the back. Fold any excess length underneath the fabric, facing the sewing machine, and pin it in place.


Note that the fabric should come all the way down to the bottom of the machine.
Take the sewing fabric off the sewing machine and examine your newly pinned edges. The new edges should be parallel with each other and perpendicular to the sides of the machine. If necessary, readjust your marked hem so that any uneven portion aligns itself to the longest part of your new hemline.
When done, the length should come to a value equal to twice the machine height plus the machine depth (height + height + depth).

, With the wrong side of the fabric facing up, transfer the fabric to your sewing machine. Make a straight stitch over the top of both hemmed edges to hold them in place. Remove the pins when done.


You do not need to trim away the excess hem fabric. Since this cover is so lightweight to begin with, the excess material at the bottom of the hem should not cause a problem.
Since you do not need to cut away any of the excess cloth, there will be no raw edge to stitch over, making this step quick and simple.

, Choose ribbon that coordinates well with the cloth and cut four pieces that are each 14 inches (35.5 cm) long.


Choose thick, sturdy ribbon. Cotton twill tape also works well.

, Fold one end of each ribbon down 1/4 inch (0.6 cm). Fold the same end down in the same direction a second time, making this fold 1/4 inch (0.6 cm), as well. Sew this end down with a straight stitch.


Repeat this step with each piece of ribbon.
You only need to sew one end of each ribbon, not both ends. The other end will be sewn to the inside of the sewing machine cover, so you should not unravel and the raw end will not be visible from the outside.

, Fold the raw end of each ribbon over by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). Pin this end of each ribbon to the underside of the cloth so that the pieces form ties along the side of the machine when the cover is draped over it.


To figure out where the pieces of ribbon should go, begin by calculating half the height of the sewing machine (height * 1/2).
Use your tape measure to measure out this new length from the bottom of one long side of your cloth. Pin one ribbon there.
Measure out this new length from the top of the same side of your cloth. Pin a second ribbon there.
Repeat this process to pin the other two pieces of ribbon to the other long side of the cloth.

, With the cloth wrong-side up, transfer it over to your sewing machine. Sew a straight stitch over the folded end of each ribbon, securing the ribbon to the cloth.


Remove the pins when done.

, Drape the cover over your sewing machine so that it covers the machine from front to back. Tie the ribbons into bows at the right and left sides of the machine, making the bows tight enough to hold the cover in place.


This step completes your sewing machine cover.

Cut out three pieces of fabric.,
Mark the center of your large piece.,
Pin the shorter pieces onto the large piece.,
Stitch the side pieces in place.,
Make small cuts on either side of each side piece.,
Sew along one length of the each side piece.,
Sew along the remaining length of each side piece.,
Hem the bottom.,
Put the cozy on your machine.",How to Make a Sewing Machine Cover3," You will need one piece to cover the machine from front to back and two pieces to cover the sides.


The main piece needs to be as wide as the width of the sewing machine, plus an added 1 inch (2.5 cm) for a seam allowance. The piece also needs to equal an amount twice as long as the height of the sewing machine, plus the depth of the sewing machine, plus a 1 inch (2.5 cm) seam allowance (height + height + depth + 1 inch ).
Both side pieces need to be as tall as the height of the sewing machine and as wide as the depth of the sewing machine. Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to both measurements for a seam allowance.

, Lay the large piece flat in front of you, right side up, with the long sides positioned on the top and bottom. Use a tape measure to find the exact center of both the top and bottom edges.


Mark the center with a straight pin, fabric pencil, or chalk.

, Place one of the shorter side pieces on the table, right side down, so that the shorter sides are on the top and bottom. Mark the center of the top edge, then line up this center with the top center mark of the large piece of fabric. Pin the pieces together.


You'll do essentially the same thing with the other side piece. Place the piece right side down on the table, but this time, mark the center of the bottom edge. Line this center mark up with the bottom center mark of the large piece of fabric and pin the two pieces together.

, Move the arrangement over to your sewing machine. Sew straight across the top edge of the top side piece with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance, joining it to the main body piece in the process.


Do not sew the entire top edge of the side piece. Instead, leave a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of fabric free on either side. This loose fabric will be used later when you sew the sides of the side piece to the sides of the body piece.
Repeat this process with the bottom side piece, sewing along the bottom edge with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance. Leave 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) on either side of this edge, as well.

, Use scissors to carefully cut a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) line into the main body piece, directly along the outside edges of your top side piece.


Repeat this step along the bottom edge of the body, positioning the cuts just outside of the bottom side piece.

, Fold the fabric so that the right side of the top side piece meets with the upper right edge of the main body piece. Pin the edges together, then stitch them together with a straight stitch on your sewing machine. Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


Repeat this with the bottom side piece. Fold the fabric so that the right side of the bottom side piece meets the lower right edge of the main body piece. Pin, then sew, the edges together with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

, Fold the fabric so that the left side of the top side piece meets with the upper left edge of your main body piece. Pin the two edges together, then sew them together using a straight stitch and a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.


Repeat this step with the bottom side piece, as well. Fold the fabric so that the left side of the bottom left piece lines up with the lower left edge of the main body piece. Pin, then sew in place using a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance.

, At this point, the cover should be inside out; if not, then turn it inside out now. Fold the bottom edge up by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) all the way around the cover. Pin it in place, then stitch the hem down with your sewing machine.


When the hem is finished, turn the cover right side out.

, The cover should slide over the top of your sewing machine for a snug fit, but you should not have to struggle or squeeze it on.


The completion of this step marks the end of the project.

Use an open-toe appliqué foot.,
Consider whether you want the thread to show or not on the motif itself.,
Select and set the appropriate stitching type on your machine.,
Start by back-stitching initial threads to keep them secured to the fabric.,
Stitch on the motif.",How to Apply Fabric Motifs Using a Sewing Machine," This is an important requirement as it ensures that you will be able to get the maximum visibility when moving over the application of the motif.;
, If it doesn't matter that it shows, or if it forms part of the design to have the thread showing, be sure to select thread that matches the motif. If you want the stitches to be invisible, however, use clear monofilament thread on top and a thread that matches the background fabric in the bobbin:


For lighter shades (whites, creams, beige, etc.), use clear monofilament thread.
For darker shades (blues, greens, blacks, etc.), use smoke-coloured monofilament thread.

, The stitching is dependent on your design and wishes. Here are some hints:


Naive style: use zigzag stitch set narrow and open
Neat satin stitch: use zigzag stitch set close
Blind hem stitch: use this set with a very reduced length and width. If you want to use this stitch but your machine doesn't have it, resort to using the narrow open zigzag stitch style instead.

, The same goes for when you complete the stitching, to finish off.

, If you haven't done this before, try a test piece first, using a scrap rather than a motif. Do this until you feel comfortable with the method of application. Once you feel ready, go for it!

,
Tie knot and turn inside out.

,
Use a Slip Stitch to close.

",How to Use Pinking Shears," See How to choose pinking shears for more information.

, Not all fabrics will respond well to pinking shears. The best fabric is that which is woven tightly.

, If a single layer is not enough to get a good grip, two and maybe up to four layers might work better. One important caveat is to ensure you don't make the layers too thick, so that the fabric mangles or warps. Pinking shears are made for one layer, so adding more needs to be by trial and error. Four layers is probably the maximum, although this will depend on the fabric.


For more delicate fabric, it might cut if there is a solid backing behind the fabric. You will need to cut this backing fabric as well, so be sure it's just scrap material.
Take care with fabric that isn't plain or straight lined. Pattern fabrics can be very hard to achieve a professional appearance with pinking, at least for garments. However, if it's just a jam jar lid cover, there's no need to worry!

, The edge should always be created as the last embellishment.

, Your grip should be firm but comfortable. If you purchased ambidextrous pinking shears, either hand will be fine depending on your own coordination with each hand. Otherwise, be sure to hold the pinking shears in the correct hand.

, They cannot cut if held at an angle. (Try it and you'll see what happens; either it won't cut or it will mangle and chew up the fabric.) You'll soon get a feel for it.

, Start from the second rear tooth and simply bring down the blades until they are completely closed. Do not try to move along as with normal scissors or the teeth will catch and rip the fabric. After you have made the first cut, open the pinking shears and align the teeth with the last notch cut on the fabric and press down again. Continue until the length is cut.

, Use a backstitch for the beginning and end of the pieces and a running stitch or something for the middle.;

If you do not have a manual for your sewing machine, then you might want to check the internet for specific instructions on how to use your machine. You may even be able to find an online version of the manual, or you can write to the sewing machine company and request a manual to replace the missing one.;
, Your sewing machine’s manual should include a diagram that explains all of the parts to your sewing machine. Check to make sure that you have all of these necessary parts before you do anything else. To start your sewing machine, you will need:


A sewing machine needle
Bobbin
Thread
Bobbin case
Presser foot
Pedal

, If your sewing machine came with a quick startup guide then this is a great way to start your machine. Follow the instructions for how to get your machine started.


If your machine’s manual does not include these instructions, or you cannot follow them, then you can start your machine by threading the bobbin and needle and changing the settings to prepare it for use.

, For most sewing machines, the power switch is on the right side of the machine. Locate the power switch and turn it on before you use your machine.Of course, make sure that your machine is plugged in as well.

, The bobbin is a small spool of thread that is loaded underneath your needle and it supplies the thread that comes up through the base of your machine. This thread connects with the thread on your needle and forms stitches.


To wind the bobbin, insert the thread through the hole in your spool and then wind it around the bobbin a couple of times. Then, place the bobbin onto the small spool pin so that it is locked into place.Place your thread on the larger spool. Then, slowly apply pressure to your pedal and watch the bobbin wind with thread. Stop the pedal when the bobbin is nearly full.If you have pre-threaded bobbins, then you do not have to worry about threading a bobbin.

, Once the bobbin is threaded, you will need to load it into the bobbin case below your needle. Pop off the cover to reveal the case. Then, insert the bobbin into the case as indicated on your machine. There should be an arrow to show which direction the thread should be going.If you have your manual, then be sure to check your machine’s specific instructions for loading the bobbin. With some machines, you just pop the bobbin into place, while others require you to remove the case and insert the bobbing before you load it.
Put the cover back on after the bobbin is loaded.

, After your bobbin is in place, you will need to guide your thread through the top area of your machine. To do this, place the thread on the larger spool pin located on the top of your machine.Your machine should indicate where the thread goes, or you can check your manual.


Then, pull a piece of thread away from the spool and bring it across the top of the machine, and down through the first slot. Then bring the thread back up to the top of the machine, and down again towards the needle.
Your machine should have a printed diagram on it or at least some arrows on it that indicate where the thread should go., To thread the needle, bring the thread down and insert it through the eye of the needle on your machine. Then, pull the thread until it is taut.You should leave at least a few inches of thread to help the top thread and lower thread to connect with each other.

, To catch the thread, turn the knob on the side of your machine once or twice. As you do this, you should see the bottom thread come up through the machine base. Use a ruler or other flat object to push the thread strands to the back of your machine.Your machine is now threaded and ready to use!

, Before you begin sewing for the first time, make sure that you check your stitch setting. You can find the stitch setting by checking the knob or digital display on your sewing machine. Turn the knob or select a new stitch setting on your digital display to change the stitch setting.The basic stitch that most patterns call for is a straight stitch, which is setting number one on most machines. However, be sure to check your manual to find out if this is correct, and whether you need to make any other adjustments to use a specific stitch setting.
For example, your machine may automatically adjust the tension for you, or you may need to adjust the tension manually depending on the type of machine you have.

, When your machine is set properly, you can raise the presser foot and insert your fabric. There should be a lever on the underside of your machine that you can flip to raise the presser foot. After you raise the presser foot, insert your fabric and then lower the presser foot to hold it in place.


Check your manual if you cannot locate the presser foot.
Try using a piece of scrap fabric to test the stitch before you work on a project.

, When you are ready to sew, apply gentle pressure to the pedal with your foot. This will make the needle move and the teeth on your machine will move the fabric forward as you sew. Use your fingers to guide the fabric as you apply gentle pressure, but keep them away from the needle.


Make sure that the pedal is somewhere that is easy for you reach and that will be comfortable for you to apply pressure to.If the fabric is going to fast or if the stitches look sloppy, then stop the machine and make adjustments. Most sewing manuals come with troubleshooting sections to help you solve problems. However, you can also go back through the threading process, check the tension on your machine, and check the stitch setting to find a solution.

Change your sewing machine needle.,
Sew with a regular weight cotton thread.,
Set your machine to the straight stitch setting.,
Avoid backstitching.,
Hold the fabric on both sides.,
Run tests on a piece of scrap fabric first.",How to Sew Organza1," Your regular needle might be okay for sewing organza, but it is best to check it first. You will need a size 8 to 11 (60 to 75) universal needle for working with organza fabric.You could also try using a small size sharp point needle. These are usually best for sewing with delicate fabrics.Make sure you have changed your needle recently. You should replace your needle after every project or at least after every four hours of sewing with the same needle.;
, You don’t need to get a specialty thread to work with organza. Just use a regular weight cotton thread to sew your project.Opt for a color that is close to the color of your fabric to help the stitches blend in. Otherwise, they may stand out and this may look unappealing. For example, if you are using a pale pink organza fabric, then opt for a pale pink thread to match.

, When sewing with organza, your best bet is to use the straight stitch setting. This is the most basic stitch you can use and it will result in a straight, clean line. Avoid using fancy stitches for organza fabric.After you have your straight stitch seam, you may want to add a zigzag seam next to it towards the outer edge. This can help to reinforce the seam and the seam won’t be visible because it will be on the outer edge., It is important to avoid backstitching with organza fabric because this can damage the fabric. Only sew across your fabric one time and in one direction. Make sure that all of your settings are correct before you begin.Also, keep in mind that you cannot use a seam ripper for organza fabrics. Tearing out stitches will damage the fabric. If you make a mistake, then you might need to just get new fabric and start over.

, To avoid puckering, it is important to place even pressure on both sides of the organza as you sew. Keep one hand behind the presser foot and the other hand in front of it to hold the organza. Keep the fabric taut, but don’t stretch it or apply too much pressure or it may tear or affect the stitching., Before you start sewing your organza, try testing your stitches on a scrap piece of organza fabric first. This will help to ensure that the stitch you are using will not damage your fabric and give you a chance to adjust your settings before you work on the actual project."

Locate your sergers power button and switch it off., Most sergers use four spools of thread: two for looping underneath the needles and two to use in the needles. The model you have will tell you the order in which you thread them. Look at the threading diagram on your machine.A 3-thread machine has an upper looper, lower looper and a single needle thread.

, More than likely the upper looper will be on the right side of the machine. Set a spool of thread on the correct spindle for this.

, Pull the upper looper thread up so that it is just below the needles. Remove the faceplate on the machine's front and pull the thread through the metal loops underneath the plate. Your serger will most likely have a color-coded guide to help you thread the upper looper.

, Set the spool on the second spindle and bring the thread over the front of the machine. Use tweezers to help you get the thread through the tight spots on the machine.

, Set the threads on the spindles and bring them over the front of the machine. Put the thread through the needle or needles on the overlock sewing machine.

, You will need to use your serger to adjust the tension, so switch the power button on.

, A serger can do many things like create a rolled hem, finish raw knit edges and gather fabric. Look at your user manual to determine what stitch you need to use for your desired result.Visit https://www.craftsy.com/blog/2012/10/what-does-this-serger-stitch-do/ for more information or if you don't have a manual.

, After you decide on what effect you want, your manual should tell you the required tension for each spool. Adjust each tension dial accordingly., You do not need fabric under the needles to test a serger stitch. Place your foot on the machine pedal and let the machine create looped thread.

, You should have an idea of how your stitch should look by looking in your serger’s user manual. The loops and interlocking stitches should be even, without areas that are too even or too loose.


If the stitches are loose, adjust the tension dials next to each spool of thread on the overlock sewing machine to make the thread tighter.
If the fabric is puckered or bunched up, loosen the tension on the serger.

, Find a piece of scrap fabric to test your stitch. Continue to sew practice stitches until the stitches are even.

, Lift the presser foot lever up to lift the metal presser foot and turn the needle dial towards you to lift the needles., Lift your practice string up and back while you slide your fabric under the presser foot and needles.

, Lower the presser lever to lower the foot and turn the needle dial towards you to lower the needles.

, A serger will finish seams and cut your fabric at the same time. Look at the seam allowance numbers to the right of the needle and push the fabric past the blade accordingly. This can be 1.5 to 2.5 cm depending on what seam allowance you used when measuring your fabric.

, Use the foot pedal to control the speed when sewing. Don't push on the fabric too hard and remember to keep the fabric straight. The feet on the overlock sewing machine should help push the fabric through.

, Continue sewing for a few stitches at the end of your seam to create a tail of stitches that you can tuck under and hand sew in place.

Opt for simple designs.,
Pre-wash your fabric only if necessary.,
Press the fabric with a dry iron if needed.,
Hold down the edges when measuring and cutting.,
Use a pencil, pen, or chalk to mark the fabric.",How to Sew Organza2," Sheers like organza are fancy enough on their own, so it is not necessary to use an intricate design when you are working with them. Instead, opt for simple designs that will showcase the fabric.For example, you might want to avoid things like pleating and intricate draping.

, If you anticipate needing to wash it later on, then it is important to do a pre-wash before sewing to ensure that the fabric will not shrink after you sew it.Keep in mind that it is generally best not to wash organza, so if you do not anticipate needing to wash it, then don’t pre-wash it.Also, be aware that pre-washing organza will soften the fabric, so it may not provide the same amount of structure before it has been washed., If your fabric is wrinkled or creased, then you may want to press it before you sew. However, the steam from an iron can leave water spots or cause discoloration to organza fabric. Use a dry iron to press the fabric if needed.Make sure that the iron is on the lowest setting., Organza is slippery, so it is important to weigh it down to prevent it from moving while you measure and cut it. You can use weights, push pins, or tape to hold down your fabric.Try using double sided tape to attach the organza to your work surface.Keep in mind that pinning can damage the fabric, so use them sparingly, if at all., Organza can get stained easily, so avoid using a marker or anything else that might not come off the fabric easily. A pencil, pen, or piece of chalk will probably work best for marking.Test out your marking method on a scrap piece of fabric first to see if it will come out easily.

Order online if you need a wide choice.,
Look through the array of bead products from the comfort of your chair.,
Make sure your credit card has the needed amount for your order before you complete the purchase.",How to Buy Beads in Bulk1," One of the best sources for buying bulk beads is ordering them online. There are numerous online shops that sell bulk beads for cheap prices, because - let's face it - beads aren't that hard or expensive to produce; the hard part is to create masterpieces with them: jewelry, decorations, etc. Online stores and auction sellers will have tons of differently shaped, coloured and sized beads for you to browse through. As an added bonus, it will likely be easy to source related raw materials from the same seller when you're shopping online.


Once you've found an an online shop that sells bulk beads, it's often a good idea to create an account. That way the store can keep a track of your last purchases, making it easier for you to remember.
Make sure you fill in your personal information correctly so the package reaches you instead of someone else. Some stores may also give you the option of having items registered for delivery, so decide whether the additional expense is worth it for you.;
, Choose the ones that best suit your needs. It can be helpful to do this with the project book or sheets alongside you, to help you get the right sizes, shapes and colours.


When browsing but before you're sure about purchasing, consider adding your finds to a wishlist or directly to the cart, for considering later. You can recheck the bead choices you've made later, to see which one you actually want to buy in the end. Bead buying can be overwhelming when there are lots of choices!

, Once paid for, all you need to do is wait for the products to reach you, then you can start going wild with your imagination. While waiting, don't forget to tag the pages of your bead book or set out your project sheets in readiness for following when the beads turn up. You might also need to get wire, pliers, findings, etc., so check what else to get to make yourself project-ready.

, For beginners, a simple pattern that uses alternating colors of same sized beads is likely best. This will prevent any complications between the bead width and thickness of the line. However, differing sizes, shapes, and colors can add variety to your design.Avoid shape edged shapes in your beads. Bracelets and necklaces that have beads with points can be uncomfortable to the wearer.

, Most beading materials can be bought at your local craft store, or even in the craft or school supply section of general retailers. You'll need to coordinate the thickness of your line with the thickness of your beads, but this can be done easily by comparing the bead thickness listed on the package of your beads with the thickness listed on the wire package. Including these, you'll also need:Beads (similar sized; many)
Beading line (i.e. - fishing line, silk cord, nylon needle-end cord)
Clasp (1)
Fold over bead tips
Jump ring (1)
Round nose pliers
Scissors

, A cluttered work space can lead to beads getting knocked over or scissors misplaced. You might want to lay down a towel or cloth if you are working on a hard surface. This will allow beads to nest in the cloth, preventing runaway beads.For more involved beading projects, you might make use of sticky bead mats and rimmed bead trays to keep your beads organized.

, Now is the time for you to organize your beads into the pattern you imagined earlier. This will help give you a sense of length for your jewelry and will also give you a preview of how the design you've chosen will look.


For shorter length projects, simple designs are best. Generally speaking, long, complex, or intricate patterns are poorly suited for beaded rings and bracelets.
Laying out your beads before hand will also speed the process, saving you precious minutes spent rooting around your bead container for the bead you need.

, You'll want the length of your beading line to be longer than your target length. This will allow you extra line if you make a mistake or need to tie a knot. Also, many designs will make use of clasps, and extra line will make the ends of your jewelry easier to work with.Gauge the appropriate length of your jewelry for your project by holding your line up to the body part it is intended to be worn on.
You may need to wrap your line around the body part to get the most accurate idea of the length of line you'll need.

, Use your wire cutters to cut your cord approximately 3"" (7.6 cm) longer than the target length of your bracelet. You can also use a bead board to measure out the length of your line more accurately by aligning your cord with the length markings on the board.


If you plan on making your bracelet or other beaded jewelry without a clasp, you may want to string your beads on elastic cord so it can flex to fit the wearer.
If using a non-elastic line, make sure your line is big enough to fit over the widest section of the body part the jewelry is intended for. This way, the bracelet can be slipped on and off.

, To prevent beads from falling off the end of the cord, tie one bead approximately 1"" (2.5 cm) from the end, using an overhand knot or a square knot. Pull the knot lightly so it is tight enough to hold in place, but loose enough that you can remove and use this bead later if you like.

, Slide your beads down the length of your line to meet the stopper-bead you have tied to the knotted end. Your pattern will be added to the cord starting from that end, so you should start add beads from your pattern in sequence, from one end of the pattern to the end., It's easy to get carried away when beading! Don't worry if you think you've gone too far, simply drape your jewelry across the body part it's intended for to check the length. In the case of the guided example, hold the bracelet by the loose end to prevent losing any beads, and check to see that the design stretches all the way around the wrist.


Feel free to add or subtract beads as necessary.

, If you have decided not to use a clasp to join the ends of your bracelet, finish ends by tying them together in a surgeon's knot. This simple knot can be accomplished by:


Creating a loop with both ends of your line.
Feeding the ends through the loop and upward.
Taking the ends around the top of the loop and back around and through it.
Pulling the ends to tighten the knot.
Adding a dab of superglue to the knot can further strengthen it (optional).
When the glue is dry, use scissors to trim cord ends., When adding a clasp, you may need to remove a few beads from your pattern. The total length of your clasp and its parts may require a few extra inches of line that is occupied by your beads for it to be attached.

, You might be able to tie your cord directly to the clasp using a few overhand knots. In some cases, you might need one or more pairs of jump rings, split rings, crimp beads, or fold-over bead tips to securely attach the cord to the clasp. Fold-over (or clamshell) bead tips have a metal loop that attaches to the clasp, or can also be used to connect to a jump ring and then a clasp.Use a hollow cup/bead at the end of your design to hide your knot from view.

, String the end of your cord through the small hole in the bead tip and bring the cord into the cupped section. Securely knot the cord so as to restrict your line from moving back through the hole. Hide the knot by carefully closing the 2 cupped halves of the bead tip toward each other with your pliers.Your knot should be small enough to hide inside the cup, but large enough not to feed back through the hole.
You can use a tiny bead as a stopper on the inside the cup. Simply knot this tiny bead onto your line and tuck it in the cupped portion of the fold-over bead.

, You'll need your pliers to bend the connector of your fold-over bead onto your jump ring. Bend the connector to the side to create a gap big enough for you to add your jump ring, and then bend the connector back into place.


Twisting connectors and jump rings to the side will prevent the metal from becoming loosely connected., Take your bracelet around your wrist and connect your clasp to the jump ring. Make sure that the length is sufficient by wearing it for a day.If the bracelet falls off your hand, is too loose, or is too tight, you may want to untie your end knot and make some adjustments.


When you are certain your bracelet is finished, use your scissors to cut off any extra line that remains."

Find a local bead seller.,
Consider which kinds of beads you need before you go shopping.,
Look for the beads you need.,
Complete the purchase to your satisfaction and take the beads home.",How to Buy Beads in Bulk2," Look for a store that sell bulk products or will sell items in bulk for you.


The diversity of the product depends on the size of the store.

, This means thinking about what shapes, sizes, colours, etc. will work for your planned project. If you have a purchase plan before arriving at the store, you'll know what you're looking for and won't end up buying a bagful of beads that are totally unrelated to your project. This may sound funny now but when you're confronted by rows and rows of wonderful beads, it may be tempting to splurge without having any idea whether you'll ever use the additional beads.

, It's a good idea to try to negotiate their price with the seller; this won't work all the time but it's worth trying.


Ask the retailer for assistance if you want beads taken out of bags, jars, etc. You may wish to feel the weight, texture, etc. rather than assuming the beads are okay without handling them.
Ask for better lighting if the beads are not clear enough to you. The retailer may have a lamp you can place the beads under.
If you don't see the beads you'd like, or there aren't sufficient quantities, ask the retailer if they will make a special order for you.

, Once home, enjoy beading with the bulk beads you just purchased.

, Again, it is the same procedure. For a little flair, you can use a different color for the center bead here, allowing you to put a ""stripe"" on your lizard's back.









These three beads are the beginning of the ""back."" You'll need to start the limbs after this.

"
"
Set aside two beads for the body and three other beads for the feet.,
Thread the two body beads on the left string and slide them down close to the body.,
Slide the black beads on, just above the legs.,
Thread the end of the left string through the two beads for the leg.,
Pull the string tight to pull everything together, adjusting slightly as necessary.,
Repeat the process with the other string to make the right leg.",How to Make a Beaded Lizard3," Here, the body beads are still yellow and the feet will be black.








, Push them almost all the way to the body. These are your legs.








, Keep them close, but separated.








, You just want to thread through your two yellow beads, not the three for the feet.








, Use your fingers to make sure nothing bunches up. This is your first leg! Note how it only requires the left string to make -- you should never touch the right one when making the left leg.








, Once done, it is time to move back to the body.








"
"
Build three more body rows identically to the first.,
Make two more legs the same way you made the first two.,
Add two more body beads, to make the base of the tail (identical to the neck).,
Slide the first tail bead on the left string, thread the right string through the opposite side, and pull.,
Tie a double knot at the end of the tail to keep the beads in place.",How to Make a Beaded Lizard4," Put three beads on the left string, remembering to alternate them if you're doing a two-colored body. Then slide the right string in the opposite direction as the left and pull the two ends to slide the beads up to the body.









You need three more rows before starting the feet again.

, After the three lengths of the body, add two more legs. The process is identical.








, You should have the process down pat by now. Two beads on the left string, feed through the right string and pull tight.








, The tail is simply the same process as the body, but its only one bead per layer. You can choose any color you want. Alternating looks great too, and you can use as many beads as you want for the length of tail you like.








, You can tie any knot you want, but a simple square knot will do just fine. You can use the knot used to tie your shoes as well, but make sure you double knot it.

Learn a bit of terminology.,
Learn the differences between normal bead weaving and seed bead weaving.,
Warp the loom for seed bead weaving.,
String the loom so that you can slip the thread off the dowel holder without clipping all the threads.,
Tie the other end down with a double knot as well (on the opposite side from your starter knot) around the pin on the dowel.,
Thread your needle and secure the weft thread (white) with a double knot to the warp thread (pink).,
Slip 8 beads onto your needle and pass it through UNDER the warp threads.,
Push the needle back through the beads over the top of the warp threads, making sure that you do not split the thread.

,
Continue weaving your beads until you have reached the required length for your item.,
Thread and sew the beginning weft thread through a row of beads to tidy it off.,
Loosen one dowel slightly and turn the pin towards the woven strip so that the threads can fall off the pin.

,
Lift all the threads off being careful not to pull on them and so warp your strip.,
Gently lift your work over the loom and it will automatically slip off the pin on the other side.,
Instead of loose threads hanging off the sides, you should now have little loops.

,
Start with a thread at or near the centre, to leave enough thread either side of the bracelet to finish off your work and still have enough thread to add a clasp.

,
Hold the work firmly in one hand and start by pulling the centre thread.,
Continue doing this until all the threads are pulled through.

,
Use the two remaining threads to add a clasp or finish the piece however you want.

",How to Weave with Seed Beads,"


Warp Thread: The long, strong thread running over the loom
Weft Thread: The thread you string the beads onto and then weave under and over the warp thread, creating the weft thread
Dowel: The round wooden stick at either end of the loom.;
, In particular, Be careful not to split the thread with the needle as you work your way across the warp, as you will then not be able to pull your warp thread through the weft thread.

, Tie one end of the thread onto the pin on the dowel.

,


Pull the thread over the top of the loom and wind around the pin on the other dowel. Make sure that the thread ends up in the groves on the top of your loom, such that the thread is straight as possible.
Pull the thread over the loom and then wind it under the pin and over the top of the loom again. Make sure to always use a separate set of groves. Continue warping the loom with sufficient threads to accommodate the required number of beads to obtain the width of your piece. You will need one more thread than the number of beads. This will also depend on the size of the beads you are using, if the beads you are using are bigger than the spaces between the threads, go back and add an extra empty grove in between each thread.
Thread from the outside in. This is to keep the threads tidy on the pins and prevent a bunch of knots when the threads are removed from the loom.

,


This way of warping is absolutely essential for this method.

, Here, there is enough thread on the loop to hold 8 beads.

, With your other hand, push the beads up through the threads.

,, You also may need to add another weft thread, to do so, just repeat the steps for adding the first weft thread. Once the desired length is reached, work the thread back and forth a few rows. Make sure this row is secure so the beads don’t fall off.

, The weaving part is done. The rest is finishing.

,, Snip only the thread that is knotted, just above the knot.

, Again, snip only the thread that is knotted, just above the knot.

,,, Then take it one row at a time on either side of the centre.


Keep the tension even. Don’t pull the thread too tightly as this will cause your beadwork to scrunch up. If you do pull it too tightly, just smooth it out again. After each pull, your thread will become longer. Continue like this until you have pulled all the threads through.
You will also notice that you once you have pulled a thread through, the ends are pulled completely onto the bead. On the left hand side, the thread (which was the long thread) is now also pulled completely onto the bead.

Core the foam with the plastic straw.,


Cut the end of the straw at a slant.
,


Make the pointed tip round.,


Seal the other end with the flame of a lighter.,


Use your new tool.",How to Store Seed Beads in Plastic Straws," Push the straw carefully through the foam, making sure the straw doesn't bend (which will weaken it and make it difficult to push through). It may help to put your thumb at the opposite end of the straw to seal the air in and make the straw more firm. When you have cored the foam, pull the core out of the straw. This will be a cap to hold the beads in.




 















;
,, Cut off the sharp tip. You'll want to use this slanted opening as a scoop, so getting rid of the point ensures that it won't catch on the surface you're scooping the beads from., Hold the opening closed with pliers and expose it to the flame so that it melts closed. See How to Make Floating Hearts from Plastic Straws for a few more pictures and details., It's a scoop and container in one! After scooping up the beads, keep them contained by inserting the foam core."

Visit a local bead store and look for their glass bead section.,
Check out lampwork glass beads.,
Check that the glass bead has been annealed.",How to Choose Glass Beads," There will be a lot of glass beads, as they are the most common and easily available type of manmade beads. Glass beads come from all around the world, so you'll have plenty of choices. Select according to:


Size - from tiny to large, match the size to suit your project






Color - there will an enormous range of choice of colors






Shape - round, donut shaped with a hole, oval, heart shaped, animal shaped, cylinder, triangular, cubes, hex cuts, bugle, etc.






Weight - ensure that the bead weight can be supported in the project you're doing.





;
, Lampwork glass beads are in a category of their own. Lampwork beads are made by hand and each one is unique as a result. This uniqueness is reflected in the price.

Lampwork beads with metal cores are good because they last longer.






If you find lampwork beads expensive, consider buying a few as feature pieces for your project and use ordinary glass beads for the rest of it (as in the image).







, Annealing means that the glass bead has been heated and cooled in a kiln. If this process has not been followed, the glass bead can break or shatter any time, even if it appears sturdy.


You will need to trust the retailer's advice on finding annealed beads.
The cheaper the glass beads, the greater the likelihood that they have not been annealed.

"
"
Sort the beads.,
Examine the bead by sight.,
Examine the bead by feel.,
Do a sound test.,
Look at accompanying paraphernalia.,
Check online and in books for pictures.,
If you're not sure, the final test is simple.",How to Identify Vintage Beads," If you've already purchased a bag of beads, sort them into sizes, colors, shapes, etc., to make it easier to work through them.;
, Be sure to do this under excellent light conditions, such as lots of natural light or a strong lamp. Use a magnifying glass or lamp if needed. When looking at a bead to identify its age, the following considerations are important:


Can you see a seam? If so, this can indicated a mold for a plastic bead, or pressed glass.
What sort of texture can you see? Some textures are clearly modern, whereas others might indicate age.
Is there a gloss, sheen, or other shiny element to the bead that could help to indicate its origin? Or, is there natural aging taking place, indicating a natural product that has been around for a long time? Don't forget to check for chips (stone/glass), and erosion signs.
Is there any part of the bead's coloring or finish worn away? This could indicate a reproduction with poor application of paintwork or finishing.
Are there any specific markings?
Check the hole size. A larger hole might indicate an older bead because of the lack of sophisticated cutting tools.This doesn't always hold, however, as craftspersons who took time and effort to create delicate beads would have been very careful.
Is the bead carved? Ivory, vegetable ivory, and bone were typically carved by hand in older times. Painstaking but definitely beautiful!
Are there any embellishments or settings accompanying the beads? The quality of these can help to establish the age, as older embellishments and settings tended to be of higher quality, and anything that needed to be held in was done so by the embellishment rather than by glue.

, Plastic beads are modern, whereas glass beads were used in vintage times. Naturally, glass is still used today, so this isn't the end of your testing, but discarding of the plastic beads is a good start when hunting for vintage. When feeling the bead, consider the following:


Is the bead cold to the touch? This is a good sign, indicating that it might be glass, stone, gemstone, metal, pearl, or shell. All of these materials were used to create vintage beads.
If it is warm, this is a sign that is might be plastic. Take care, however, as beads that feel warm could still be vintage but made from amber, nuts, vegetable ivory, wood, Bakelite (vintage plastic), bone and animal-derived ivory.
If the bead feels light, it's more likely to be plastic than glass.

, Gently jiggle the beads in your cupped hands. When they fall together, what is the sound that they make?


A soft clinking or barely any noise at all can indicate plastic.
A heavier noise can indicate glass.
You will need to be familiar with the sounds of glass, etc.; just keep training your ear and you'll seen get the hang of this method.

, If your beads came with other items, sometimes these can help provide clues, especially if you inherited a jewelery box, or you bought an auction lot. Things to look for include:


Old photographs featuring family members wearing the beads.
Old bead-making items including old advertising/branding
Accompanying items are all very old as well
Newspaper cuttings with dates if you're really lucky!
While none of these things are proof alone in your detective exercise, they can help build a picture of the possible age of the accompanying beads.

, You might be able to match the beads against photos that you can see of beads in bead books or on the many beading sites that now exist online.

, It's basically down to what you want the beads for, how much you like the beads, how you came about them, whether or not they're a gift or you have to pay for them, etc. Some questions to consider include:


Do you like the bead a lot? If so, purchase or use it.
Is the price reasonable enough that it doesn't matter whether or not it's vintage?
Are you not so taken with the appearance of the bead but just wanted it to be a part of your vintage collection? If so, leave it unless it's really affordable.
Are you sitting on the fence? If so, leave it!
If you inherited them and want to know their value, seek professional advice.

, Pull out a pegboard, if you're using one, or use a hard, iron-safe work surface like a wooden table.








, Arrange the Perler beads on the pegboard or surface in whatever pattern you want, such as a heart or Pokeball. Use a picture for reference if you need to.








, If using a pegboard, carefully transfer it to an ironing board and turn on the iron. If not using a pegboard, leave the beads on the surface and turn on the iron. Place a sheet of parchment paper or Perler ironing paper over your design.









Make sure the iron is on a ""dry"" setting, not a steam one.

, Carefully move it in a circular motion, making sure that all of the beads are fused. Pressing too hard or moving too roughly can knock beads out of place! Completely fused beads shouldn't have visible holes in the center.

If you desire paint or glaze the fired whistle.",How to Make a Clay Whistle,"


Purchase clay at arts and crafts retail chains, like Michaels, or retailers such as Target/Walmart.;
, Take the ball of clay and press your thumb into the middle of it. Keep your thumb inserted into bowl and pinch clay to form the pinch pots. Press clay until pinch pot has an even thickness on all sides.Pinch clay between your thumb and your four fingers. Using four fingers, instead of one, will ensure even thickness around the pinch pot. Rotate the ball in your hand as you pinch.
Ensure that the pinch pots are approximately the same size.
Make the walls of your pinch pot around ¼ inch thick. , Score the lip of the pot using a fork or similiar tool. Dampen the rims with slip (very watery clay) or a little water. Don’t forget to score and slip the edges of the clay. If you forget to score and slip, the clay is likely to fall apart when you try to combine the pinch pots.

, This becomes the rounded part of the whistle.Work the seam closed using a tool or your finger.


Move clay back and forth over the seam until it is no longer visible. When combined, pots should make a ball or egg shape.
You want to create an air tight hollow within the combined pots.

, Achieve this by gently tapping the ball on a table.

, The mouthpiece should be about the size of the top of your finger.


Make the mouthpiece approximately 1 inch by ¾ inch thick and 1½ inches long. Make a mouthpiece that has squared sides and tapers slightly from back to front. The shape should resemble a wedge.
Ensure that the mouthpiece is thick enough to have an airway created inside of it.
Use a Popsicle stick to help you form your mouth piece. Flatten clay and lay Popsicle in the middle of it. Fold clay over Popsicle stick, creating a square shape. After forming the shape, remove Popsicle stick from clay and you will have your mouthpiece.

, Align the top of your mouthpiece with the top of your sphere.

, Insert a craft stick through the mouthpiece and into the hollow ball near the flat side. Leave the stick inserted.

, This should be done using the flat side of the stick. The stick should be inserted at a 45 degree angle until it makes contact with the first craft stick. The hole will be near the edge of the hollow ball near the mouthpiece.

, Make one of the pinch pots with a nib on the end. Use your thumb to create the nib. The nib will slightly resemble the mouthpiece of a whistle. Join the two pots together; remembering to slip and score the edges before joining them.

Insert popsicle stick horizontally into the nib once the two pots have been sealed together. Push stick all the way into the end of the whistle's body. This will create the whistle's airway.
Use a second stick and make a square incision between the nib and the body of the whistle. Remove the cut square of clay from the whistle.
Use the stick again to create a 45 degree angle on the square incision.

, If you do not succeed, reinsert the mouthpiece stick and adjust the air-hole on the bottom. This may take quite a bit of practice (see Warnings below).

If there is no sound, that may mean that the hole was placed improperly. The whistle will produce the best sound when the opening is placed directly above the spot where the mouthpiece enters the clay body.
The size of the openings created can also affect the quality of the sound produced by the whistle. Too small and there will be no sound or poor sound. A larger square shaped opening will give you the best quality of sound. Clear any loose bits of excess clay from the mouthpiece, as they can clog the opening and stop the whistle from producing sound.

, Add more holes to increase your whistle's pitch. Adding larger holes will also increase the whistle's pitch.

Consider making different shaped holes if you plan on adding more than one hole. This will maximize the number of tones produced by the whistle. Give your whistle a test blow after adding each additional hole. Do this to check the sound and to ensure that the whistle is still making sounds.

, This way you can play real musical notes. Make at least three holes. Having three holes will let you make up to 8 musical notes. These notes are: doe, ray, mi, fa, soe, la, ti, doe. Start with no holes to establish ""doe"".
Cut the first hole to create the ""ray"" note.
Cover the first hole with your finger and cut a second hole to make ""mi""note.
Blow into your whistle and try out the scale at this point. You should be able to play""doe"", ""ray"", ""mi"", ""fa"".
Cover the first two holes and cut hole a third hole to be able to make the ""soe"" note.
Create the “la” note by covering the second hole with your finger, leaving the first and third holes uncovered, and blowing into your whistle.
Make the “tie” note by covering the first hole and leaving the last two uncovered as you blow into your whistle.
Leave all holes uncovered and blow into your whistle to create the last “doe” note.

, Have fun with it! Add arms, eyes, and tails to make your own unique creation.

Let your imagination run wild and make any additions to your whistle that you like.

, Use tools to make textures and designs. Use household items as tools to create texture. Buttons, feathers, needles, toothpicks, etc; can all be great tools for adding texture to your clay.
Pressing small objects against your whistle will leave an imprint.

, Once the clay is bone-dry (not cold to the touch), you can fire it. If all goes well, the whistle will still work after it is fired.

Make sure that the piece of clay that you put inside the oven does not have any bubbles of air. If you leave air bubbles, there is the risk of losing your masterpiece by the high temperatures that the oven produces. The temperatures can cause the clay to burst into pieces if air bubbles are present.
To ensure that there are no bubbles, you should press the clay in different directions using your fingers. Finally, put it in the oven without any fear.
The kiln will harden the clay to a stone like form.
Know that clay may shrink during firing. This will change the sound that the whistle makes. Practicing making clay whistles will help you determine the appropriate size your whistle should be before firing.

,

Keep in mind that glaze requires three coats. Let one coat of glaze dry before adding another. "

Construct the first layer of the mask.,
Examine the base layer for weak areas.,
Make the second layer.,
Take a break and let the mask set.,
Commence the third layer.,
Allow the mask to begin drying.,
Remove the mask.,
Attach additional elements with more strips.,
Smooth the surface of the mask.,
Decorate the mask.",How to Make a Plaster Mask," Choose a room where you have a lot of space to spread out, since working with plaster can get messy. Lay newspapers or a drop cloth on the floor. Have paper towels handy in case a stray drip lands outside the covered area.;
, Cut bandage plaster into strips. You will need enough strips to make three layers of plaster over the face.









The strips should be about 2-3 inches wide by 3 inches (5-7.5 cm x 7.5 cm) long.
Make some strips longer, shorter, wider or thinner. You'll need strips to cover all areas of the face.
Place the strips in a bowl. Set out a second bowl filled with warm water that you will use to wet the strips.

, The person whose face you are using to mold the mask should wear clothing that he or she doesn't mind getting wet with drips of plaster.


Decide how much of the subject's face you plan to cover. It's best to have a conversation with your subject about his or her comfort level. If you wish to cover the entire face, make sure the nostril area is left clear so that the subject can breathe freely.
The process is easiest if the subject lies on the floor, but if he or she prefers to sit in a chair, wrap towels around his or her neck and shoulders.
Ask your subject to tie back his or her hair, and to pin bangs away from the face.

, Again, it's easier to work with a subject who is lying on the floor face up. Whether the subject chooses to lie on the floor or sit in a chair, instruct him or her to keep still throughout the process. Laughing or moving the face will distort the mask.








, Place it especially at the hairline, on the eyebrows, and around the sides of the nose. Don't skip this step, since it prevents your subject from experiencing pain when the mask is removed.








, Working one strip at a time, dip strips in the bowl of warm water, then run your fingers over the strips to remove excess water. The strips have more plaster on one side than the other; lay them on the subject with the side with less plaster face down. Create an even base layer, and avoid leaving gaps between strips.









Dampen a smaller strip and lay it diagonally along the nose, starting above the left eyebrow and ending next to the right nostril. Ensure the subject is able to breathe freely at all times.
Dampen another strip and place it diagonally in the opposite direction, forming an ""X"" across the bridge of the nose.
Dampen and place a larger strip across the forehead, overlapping the tops of the ""X"", smoothing the plaster as you go.
Add the remaining strips. Avoiding the triangle from the tip of the nose to the midpoint of the upper lip, repeat the dampening and placement of strips until there are none left. Cut any strip to size as needed.

, Check to see if any skin shows through. Check to see that the pieces are overlapping properly and are not too spread out.








, Focusing first on the weak areas, begin layering on more strips. This time use larger strips and try to create a uniform layer with as few bumps as possible.








, Cut strips or clean up a bit before applying the third layer, as you want the mask to set, but not start drying.

, Begin at the edges, and fold the tails of the strips down around the edges of the mask to smooth them out. This gets rid of the sharp corners left by the initial layers.









Begin building prominent features. Create a bigger nose, eyebrow ridges, and so on to add character to the mask. Do this by adding narrow pieces in layers and smoothing into shape.
Regardless of what features you build, make sure to reinforce weak areas, like the nose and eye areas, by adding extra strips there.

, After about fifteen minutes, your subject's face will begin to feel itchy. Ask the subject to gently move his or her face - lift eyebrows, crinkle the nose, and so on - to start loosening the mask.

, When the subject no longer feels ""stuck"" to the mask, gently slide your fingers along the edges to lift it away, moving your fingers inward toward the center of the mask as you lift.









While the mask is still pliable, use a hole punch or awl to poke holes about an inch back from the eyes, to run ribbon or string through.
Place the mask on a rack to dry, preferably overnight.

, You may add additional features by attaching and coating them with additional plaster strips using the same overlapping techniques you used for the base.


Consider adding such appendages as a beak (fold a paper plate in half) or horns (use cotton candy/fairy floss tubes or cones), or big bumps (use scrunched up newspaper balls). Cover them completely with plaster strips.
For natural-looking features, such as higher cheekbones or a pointy nose, use paper-based modeling clay. Spread a base layer of the clay onto the mask, then sculpt features with the clay. Cover with plaster strips and allow to dry overnight.

, Use sandpaper to smooth the bumps from the surface of the mask.









You may also choose to cover the mask with white tissue paper; spread the mask with glue, lay on the tissue paper, and allow it to dry.
Smooth and cover the back of the mask, too, since you won't want rough plaster directly touching the wearer's face.

, Use a variety of paints, or glue on feathers, sequins, beads and other decorative items.









If you want to paint the mask, brush it with a layer of gesso first. Allow the gesso to dry before you start painting.
When you are finished decorating the mask, slip a ribbon or string through the two holes and knot the ends, so you'll be able to fasten the mask to someone's face.

a loose fitting tank top
some stretchy jersey or comparable fabric in the print or color of your choice
a pair of sharp scissors
pins
a sewing machine;
, If you do not want to make pants, then you can also use a pair of old pajama bottoms for the pant bottoms of your jumpsuit. Then, all you will have to do is create a matching top and add the top to the pants.Choose a fabric color and type that matches your pajama bottoms. For example, if the pajama bottoms are navy blue and made of a jersey material, then select a similar navy blue jersey material for the top. Or, if the pajama bottoms feature a print, choose a solid in the dominant color of the print, such as red if the print is mostly red.

, Fold your fabric in half so that the print is facing in. Then, lay the fabric on a hard, clean surface, such as a large table or on the floor (as long as it is clean). Smooth out the fabric so that there are no ripples.Then, place your sweatpants on top of the fabric. There is no pattern for this project, but you can use your sweatpants to help you make the jumpsuit in the right size.
Fold the sweatpants in half so that the legs are lined up with each other. Then, lay the pants on top of your folded fabric. The waistband of the pants should be near the folded edge and the inseam of the pants should be facing out towards the outer edge of the fabric.

, The sweatpants will help you to create a loose fitting pair of pants for the bottom half of your jumpsuit. Cut the fabric in a straight line on the outer edge of your sweatpants. You will want your pants to narrow towards the bottom, so move the sweatpants aside.








After you have finished cutting the basic pattern, pick up your sweatpants and set them aside.

, The curved edge is where the waistband will be, so you will need this area to be slightly snug. Trim along this curved edge on both sides. You will need to trim off about ½ of an inch or 1½ centimeters.







, You will need to pin the curved edges in place first. These edges will make up the hip and waist area of your pants. Make sure that the fabric edges are even and place a pin every few inches.








When you are pinning the fabric, insert the ball-head pins into the fabric from the outer edge and moving in towards the center, not parallel with the edge., Begin sewing the fabric pieces together along the curved edges that you just pinned together. Do not sew any of the other edges yet. Remove the pins from the fabric right before you sew over them.Make sure that your stitches are about ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) away from the edges of the fabric. This will help to create a strong seam.
After you have finished sewing, trim off any excess thread from the areas you just sewed.

, After you have sewed the curved edges together, pick up your fabric and fan it out. Then realign the fabric so that the two seam you just sewed are facing each other. Then, lay your fabric out on a flat, clean surface again.








The finished product should look like a pair of pants minus the inseam stitches. You will need to sew this inseam next to complete the pants.

, Place one pin at the crotch and then continue placing pins along the inside of each of the pant legs. Position the pins so that they are about three inches apart. Make sure that the pins are about ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) from the edges of the fabric.








After you have finished pinning the inseams, sew along the edges and remove the pins as you go.

, To determine where to place your waistband, you will need to turn the pants inside out and try them on. You should have a large flap at the top of the pants. Pull this fabric up and then fold it over all around the waistband so that the top fold is sitting at your natural waist (or wherever you like your pants to begin).








Try to make the fold as even as possible all the way around.
When you find a comfortable height for the waistband, you can take off the pants. However, remove the pants carefully to keep the waistband folded how you like it. You can also place a few pins to secure the waistband.

, Use your scissors to trim along the bottom edges of where the folded material ends. This will seem low, but you will be adding this material back onto the pants, so don’t worry. Then, take the waistband material that you just trimmed off and reverse it. Flip the material so the print side of the material is facing out instead of turned in.








The waistband should be doubled and the print side should be facing out on both side.
Make sure that all of the edges are even.

, Hold the waistband material next to the waistline of the pants so that the top fold is facing downwards in the direction of the pant legs. Then, pull the waist of the pants through the waistband and line up the edges of the waistline with the rough edges of the waistband.Pin the edges together. Make sure that the pins go through all of the material layers.

, Once the waistband is pinned in place, sew along the edges. Sew the stitch about ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) away from the edge to create a strong seam. Pull the material taut as you sew to ensure that the waistband will not have any bumps or ripples.Pull out the pins as you go and set them aside.

, Get a large piece of the same material you used for the pants or two smaller pieces and lay them so that the print sides are facing each other. Then, place your tank top on the two layers of material.There is no pattern for the top, but the tank top will help you to cut the material in the right size and shape.

, Using your scissors, cut along the outer edges of the tank top. Follow the lines of the tank top and try to make the lines as straight an even as possible. Follow the curves of the arm holes and neck line as well.








When you are done, you will have two tank top pieces.
Keep in mind that you can make the neckline as deep or as high as you want it to be. You can also use any style for the neckline that you want. For example, you could do a scoop neck, a V-neck, or a square neck.

, Start by pinning along the edges of the arm holes and neckline for the hem. You will need to hem the neck line and arm holes twice. Fold over about ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) of material once, then pin it into place and sew along these lines.Then, remove the pins and fold over the material to create another ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) hem.
Pin and sew this hem as well.

, Next, with the two tank top pieces facing each other, line up the edges. Pin along the sides of the tank top and the shoulders. Then, sew these areas together about ½ of an inch (or 1 ½ cm) from the edge.








Remove the pins as you go.

, With your pants still right side out and the tank top inside out, slide the pant waistband through the neck of the tank top. Then, continue to slide the pants through the tank top until the top of the waistband is lined up with the bottom of the tank top. Then, pin these edges together and then sew them together.








If you are using old pajama bottoms for your jumpsuit instead of pants that you made, then you can follow the same process for attaching the tank top to the pajama bottoms. Just make sure that the bottom of your tank top matches up with the top of the elastic waistband on your pajama pants.As you sew along the edges of the tank top bottom and waistband top, pull the materials taut, This will help to ensure an even seam. It is also necessary because the tank top will be slightly larger than the waistband.

, Jumpsuits are often baggy around the waist, which can be unflattering. Defining your waist with a belt is a great option.Try a wide band stretchy belt or a thin fitted belt.

, A jumpsuit can be a little overwhelming, especially if your jumpsuit is in a bold print, so you may want to find ways to break up the pattern a bit. A vest, blazer, or jacket can help to break up the pattern or color and add a little more sophistication to your look.Try a long vest for an evening out.
Put on a blazer to make your jumpsuit workplace appropriate.
You can even try a leather or denim jacket for a fun weekend look.
A cross-body bag can also help to break up the pattern if you don’t want to wear any other clothes over your jumpsuit.

, Putting on a pair of high heels can make almost any outfit look dressy. Try wearing a pair of high heels with your jumpsuit to transform it into a more formal, dressy look.To get the opposite effect and dress down your jumpsuit, go for some simple ballet flats or a pair of strappy sandals.

, If you want to draw the eye up and away from certain features, then adding a necklace or a pair of bold earrings can also help.For example, if your jumpsuit has a deep V-neck that you want to de-emphasize, then try putting on a necklace that falls a few inches above your cleavage. Or, put on some bold, dangly earrings.

Find a fleece or wool-felt blanket.,
Fold the blanket in half widthwise.,
Draw a vertical line down the center-front of your folded blanket, from the folded edge all the way down to the bottom.,
Cut along the line that you drew.,
Cut a half-circle along the top fold to make an opening for your neck.,
Try the coat on, and place a sewing pin where your waist is on the center of each front flaps.,
Check the sleeve lengths.,
Take the coat off, then cut a short slit on each flap, using the sewing pens as a guide.,
Shorten the sleeves, if needed.,
Wear the coat.",How to Turn a Blanket Into a Coat1," You won't be doing any sewing in this method, but you will be doing some cutting. Because of this, you want a material that does not fray—such as fleece or wool-felt. A throw or twin-size blanket will work best for this. A much larger blanket may be too long, especially in the arm area.


If you do decide to use a larger blanket, you may need to cut it down.;
, If you'd like, you can fold it asymmetrically, so that the front part is shorter than the back. Once you have folded the blanket, rotate it so that the folded part it on top, and facing away from you., This will be your cutting line. A quick and easy way to find the center is to fold the blanket in half widthwise, and make a mark at the top and bottom edges.

, Make sure that you are only cutting through the front layer of fabric, and not both. Cut straight up from the bottom edge of your blanket all the way to the top edge. These two flaps will make the front of your coat.

, Make sure that the circle is centered. If you want a more tailored finish, cut a narrow half-circle through both layers of fabric first. Next, cut the circle bigger, but only on the front layer of fabric. This will create a neck opening that is narrower in the back, and wider in the front, just like in store-bought garments.


To find the circumference for the circle: measure the base of your neck, then add 1 inch (2.54 centimeters)., Drape the coat over your shoulders, with the solid piece against your back, and the two flaps hanging down in front of your chest. Figure out where your waist is, then slip sewing pin into the fabric.


The sewing pins will mark the placement for the belt holes, so that you can close the coat.

, The edges of the fabric should fall to your wrists, or just below. If the blanket is too wide and the sleeves are too long, you will need to shorten them. Figure out where you want the sleeves to end, then mark the spot with a sewing pin. Do this for both sleeves.

, Make sure that the sewing pin is centered on each flap first. Next, cut a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long slit on each front flap, then remove the sewing pin. Do not cut through the back layer of fabric.


You will be slipping a belt through these slits. If the belt you want to use is wider than 1 inch (2.54 centimeters), then cut the slit longer.

, If you made marks where you want to cut the sleeves, unfold your blanket, and spread it out on the floor. Fold the edges of the blanket inward using the sewing pin as a guide. Cut along the fold on each side, then remove the sewing pins when you are done.


Consider using one of these strips as a belt for your coat. If the strip is too wide, you can cut down lengthwise.

, Drape the coat across your shoulders, with the solid part against your back, and the two flaps hanging down in front of your chest. Place a belt behind your back, under the blanket. Wrap the belt around your waist, and slip both ends through the slits you cut. Finish off by buckling the belt.The back piece will hang loosely against your back. The front will be gathered and scrunched up.
If you are using one of the strips you cut off earlier as a belt, simply tie it in a loose knot or bow.

Plan your quilt first.,
In the same magazine, find a list of basic supplies and tools.,
Purchase your fabric and supplies.,
Cut out the pieces that go into your quilt top and sew them together, following the instructions in the pattern.,
Once your quilt top is finished, measure it and prepare the middle layer or batting by cutting it the same size as the quilt top.,
Cut your backing fabric the same size as the quilt top and batting.

,
Lay your backing fabric on a table or other surface big enough to accommodate the quilt.,
Lay your quilt top over the quilt back, right side down.,
Lay the batting down over both.

,
Baste the three layers together using safety pins all around the edges, about three inches in from the edge.

,
Sew the three layers together with a sewing machine or serger.,
After turning the quilt right side out, hand stitch the opening closed, using a small stitch so it can't be seen too well.

,
Tie the three layers together across the whole quilt, top to bottom.

,
Get a sewing needle with a large eye.,
Decide where you want the tied knots to appear on the quilt.,
Thread the needle but don't knot it.,
Cut the threads as you go, leaving enough on both sides to tie a double knot by hand.,
Your quilt is done.

",How to Make a Quick Quilt," The easiest way to do this is to buy a quilting magazine and find a pattern that's marked Easy or Beginner. Quilting magazines are found in fabric stores such as Jo-Ann, Hancock's, or local stores.;
, Almost every quilting magazine provides a how-to section that lists what you need and how to get started. At the very least, you'll need fabric, thread, scissors, a cutting mat and a rotary cutter and quilting ruler. You can sew a quilt by hand or on a sewing machine.

, Most quilters prefer 100% cotton fabric, but it's OK to use cotton/polyester blends too. Also purchase batting, which is the middle layer of the quilt, and enough additional fabric to cover the back of the quilt. It's also OK to use a bed sheet for your quilt back as long as it's big enough.

, If you have questions, consult the same magazine's how-to section or try one of the thousands of web sites that Google lists. About.com has a particularly good one found under Hobbies/Quilting. Aim for accuracy so your quilt goes together evenly on all sides.

, There are many kinds of batting, but the easiest one to work with is a thin, all-cotton or cotton/polyester blend.

,, Smooth it out with your hands and get rid of any puckers or wrinkles. The wrong side of the backing fabric should be against the table surface.

, The two right sides of the top and back should be facing one another.

,,, Leave an opening for turning the quilt right side out. The bigger the quilt, the larger the opening you will need.

,,, It should be a fairly long, strong needle that can go through all three layers of your quilt. You will also need a sturdy thread such as crochet thread, several strands of cotton embroidery thread, or other similar threads in a color that looks good with the quilt.

, Most of the time, knots are spread out evenly on the quilt about six inches apart, but you can also do a design of some kind, or just tie randomly as well.

, Take one stitch in the quilt, going in from the top, then up from the bottom. Leave a tail of thread coming out of the first hole long enough to tie a knot. This should be a small stitch.

, You can tie the knots as you stitch, or wait and tie them all at once.

Sort through your tee shirts.,
Evaluate your collection.,
Choose a pattern.,
Launder all of the shirts.,
Lay the tee shirt out flat.,
Determine what part of the tee shirt you want in the quilt and trace the perimeter of your template.

,
Cut your square panels from the shirts using a template.,
Stabilize the tee shirt panels by ironing a non-woven fusible interfacing or lightweight, fusible tricot interfacing to the back sides.,
Check to be certain that the interfacing has adhered properly.,
Decide how you'll sew the panels together.,Follow the directions in Make a Quilt to finish off the quilt when you're done with the panels.",How to Make a Quilt from Tee Shirts,"

Stack them by color and/or design.
Determine how many of them you want to use. The size and design of your finished quilt will depend on the amount of material you have available.
14x14 inch (35.5cm) squares are a common and comfortable size to use, but you can enlarge that to 18x18 inch (45cm) if the shirts are XXL and shrink that to 10x10 (25cm) or less if you will be using children's shirts.
Common blanket sizes are:

Crib - 42"" x 72"" (3x4 or 3x5 shirt grid = 12 to 15 shirts)
Twin - 66"" x 96"" (5x8 or 6x9 grid = 40 to 54 shirts)
Double/full - 81"" x 96"" (6x8 or 7x9 grid = 48 to 63 shirts)
Queen - 90"" x 102"" (8x9 or 9x10 grid = 72 to 90 shirts)
Standard King - 108"" x 102"" (10x10 or 10x11 grid = 100 to 110 shirts)
California King - 102"" x 110"" (10x11 or 11x11 grid = 110 to 121 shirts)
Note: you can use ""sashing"" or strips of cloth between the T-shirt panels to reduce the number of shirts needed... these numbers are approximate, and are for a quilt top made of nothing but tees, with no sashing.

;
, Is there a common color scheme? A theme that runs through them? Any patterns or messages that you would like to emphasize?, A simple grid pattern is the easiest, but you can get as creative as you like. For example:

45 degree block turn


 


22.5 degree turn






Window block






, Do not use fabric softeners or anti-static sheets., You may want to iron the shirts (note that many designs on t-shirts have transfers that may melt, so test a small area prior to ironing) to get out any wrinkles still left after washing and drying.
,, A square Plexiglas template can make rotary cutting of these panels a breeze.

Note: Remember to allow a half inch (1.25 cm) of seam allowance all around.

, This prevents the T-shirts from stretching or sagging during construction.
,

Once you've stabilized the knit tee shirt fabric, you are ready to sew as you would with ""normal"" fabrics.


, Sewing the panels in columns or rows and then joining those together for the complete panel is the most common method of constructing a quilt top. Here are some alternate block patterns that could work well:
,"
"
Find a blanket.,
Cut the blanket in half widthwise.,
Pin ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide double-fold bias tape along the raw edge.,
Sew the bias tape down.,
Fold the bias-taped edge down by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) to make the collar.,
Place a short, loose-fitting jacket on top of your folded blanket.,
Mark where the sleeves join the body of your jacket.,
Remove the jacket, and draw a vertical line between the top and bottom sewing pins.,
Cut the sleeve holes and remove the pins.,
Take the other blanket half, and cut it in half widthwise.,
Fold each half lengthwise, so that the finished edge of the blanket becomes the cuff.,
Shorten the sleeves, if needed.,
Check the width of the sleeves against the arm holes you cut.,
Sew the sleeves, with the right sides facing in, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Turn the sleeves right-side-out, and pin them to the sleeve holes.,
Sew the sleeves on, using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance.,
Wear the coat.",How to Turn a Blanket Into a Coat2," A heavy blanket made from fleece or felted-wool could be ideal, but you can use any type of blanket for this.

, Fold the blanket in half first, and make sure that all of the edges and corners match up. Next, cut right along the fold, then set one of the halves aside., Take one of the halves, and fold the bias tape over the raw edge. The raw edge should be sandwiched inside the bias tape, nestled right against the fold.


The color can match your blanket, or it can contrast it.
You can also use ribbon for this, if you'd like something fancier. Consider folding the ribbon in half, and then ironing it. This will create a crease, similar to what bias tapes have.

, Choose a thread color that matches the bias tape, then sew it down using the straight stitch on your sewing machine. Sew as close to the inside edge of the bias tape as you can.


Be sure to backstitch at the start and end of your sewing. This will keep the stitching from unraveling.

, Spread the blanket half down in front of you, with the bias-taped edge facing up and away from you. Next, fold the bias-taped edge down towards you by 8 inches (20.32 centimeters)., Make sure that the jacket is centered, and that the collar is aligned with the top, folded edge of your blanket. You will use this as a guide for the placement of your sleeves.If you don't have a jacket, you can use a loose-fitting sweatshirt or T-shirt instead.

, Fold the sleeves on your jacket inward. Next, take a sewing pin, and place it just below your jacket's sleeve, right next to the body. Take another sewing pin, and place it right above the sleeve, right next to the shoulder. Repeat for the other sleeve on the other side of the jacket.

, You can use a tailor's chalk or tailor's pen for this. These will be your cutting lines for the arm holes.

, For a more tailored finish, cut the slits into ovals instead. Set the blanket aside when you are done.

, Fold the blanket in half first, so that the blanket's original side edges match up; the raw edge should be on one side, and the finished edge should be on the other. Cut the blanket in half, using the fold as a guide., Take the raw edge you just cut, and fold it towards the blanket's finished side edge. You should now have something that resembled a sleeve, with a raw end and a finished end. You will be sewing the raw end into the blanket; the finished end will make the cuff.

, Measure the sleeve against your arm, placing the cuff against your wrist (or wherever you want the sleeve to end). If the sleeve is too long, place a sewing pin at the shoulder, then cut it down.


Measure your other sleeve against the one you just cut. This will ensure that both sleeves are the same length.

, Keeping the sleeve folded, place the narrow, raw end against one of the arm holes. It should be ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wider. If it is too wide, make a mark along the raw edge, then cut the sleeve accordingly. Repeat with the other sleeve.


Remember, the finished sleeve needs to be ½-inch (1.27-centimeters) wider, to allow for seam allowances.
Consider tapering the sleeves slightly towards the ""cuff"" for a more tailored look.

, Use the straight stitch on your sewing machine, and a needle and thread tension suitable for the fabric you are working with. If your fabric is not made out of fleece or felt, zigzag stitch over the raw edges of the seam; this will keep it from fraying.

, Align the raw end of the sleeve with the sleeve hole. Next, pin the sleeve in place, all the way around the arm hole.


If the arm hole is too big, position the sleeve so that the excess fabric is at the bottom. Next, use a needle and thread to close up the hole. Tie the thread off and snip off any excess.
If the sleeve is too big, position the sleeve so that the excess fabric is at top. Use a needle and thread to gather the excess fabric until it fits in the sleeve hole. Tie the thread off when you are done, and pin the sleeve in place.

, Remove the sewing pins as you sew. Again, if the fabric you are using is the kind that frays, bind the edges with a zigzag stitch.

, Your coat is now complete. If you want to get even fancier, you can add buttons or snaps to the front. You can wear the coat with the collar flattened down, or tucked up against your neck."

Finish up!",How to Tie and Finish a Basic Quilt," If you are using a quilting frame (it can be homemade), tack the bottom of the quilt to the frame, face down.;
, You'll want to stretch it a little, so cut it about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) smaller than your sheets.

,, Tack the corners first, then centers, then about every 5–6 inches (12.7–15.2 cm) along the entire edge of the blanket. When you tack, be sure to get all the layers on the tack - bottom, middle and top. The tighter you pull the sheets, the easier it is to sew the quilt.

,, 4"" separations are preferred. That makes it so that you can continuously sew and tie, only stopping when you run out of yarn in your needle. Start your marks 6-8"" from the edge of the blanket (the boards you are tacking the material to) because when you finish the blanket, you'll roll the edges and take up about 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) on each side. A tape measure will work fine too. Use a fabric marker which washes out easily.

,


Select the yarn you will be using. you may use several different colors or just one through the entire blanket. This is the simplest way to tie your blanket quickly.
Thread the needle. Use a quilting needle, or a large needle. Most quilting needles are about 3"" long with a large eye. Use cheaters to help thread the yarn. They are available at most material stores. Only thread about 6 feet (1.8 m) of yarn each time.
Start by putting the needle fully into the blanket at one of your marks. It should stick out the bottom.
Then, without actually going through, turn the needle to the side (horizontal) and pull it back until about ¼"" of the needle can be seen as a bump in the top of the quilt. Push the needle through that bump.
Now you have the needle through the entire blanket, pull it, with the yarn, all the way through until only about 2"" of the yarn sticks out of the stitch.
Tie the yarn in a square knot - ½ Knot pulled tight, then another ½ knot.
Move to the next marker and do the next stitch. Don't cut anything!
Tie a knot in the yarn without cutting it.

, When you do, tie off the last stitch, cut the needle free, re-thread the needle and keep going. Any pattern works. You can do straight lines or boxes. Boxes work well because you can do a whole section without having to get up.


Somewhere in the process, the markers will be further away than you can reach. Before you roll it, clip all the yarn exactly in the middle between the knots. When you're done clipping, you'll have perfect knots with exactly the right amount of yarn on the knot.

, With one of your helpers, undo the clamps at the edge of the blanket, remove the tacks down the edge the will be rolled, and role the frame under the blanket to the edge of the marks that you haven't stitched yet.

,, Lay the blanket flat on the floor. Roll an edge, starting from the middle on any side. Roll it 2"" wide and at least 2 times, then pin it flat.


When you get to a corner, fold the corner down towards the center of the blanket about 3"". You end up with a small triangle on the corner.
Continue rolling the first edges until you use up the triangle and are left with a straight edge.
Then start rolling the next edge matching the straight edge again. As you do, it will automatically form a straight edge corner!
Continue rolling the rest of the edges and corners, using pins to hold it in place.

, You may either hand stitch the rolled edges, or use a sewing machine to stitch the rolled edges. A pretty wavy pattern on the border adds flair.


The secret to getting the border to look right is to be sure to hold the material firmly as it passes through the sewing machine. Since the blanket is the equivalent of about six or seven layers of material, the sewing machine will try to move the bottom material, but leaves the top behind. It is best to stretch the border as it passes through the sewing machine, assuring that the top and bottom layers stay together until they are sewn.
Although you can get a lot fancier, this same process will work for any blanket.

Encourage frequent breaks.,
Ask permission before taking photos of people in class.,
Build connections with your students.,
Clean up at the end.",How to Teach a Quilting Class," Ask around the local area and see where classes are held, ie. at quilting guilds, groups, colleges or shops. If classes are not currently held nearby, consider whether you are prepared to hold classes at home or in a hired hall.


If possible find an experienced local quilt teacher that can suggest where to start (and perhaps where to avoid).
Find out the basis of pay normally expected. Are classes charged per day, per hour or per student?
Once you have established that there is a place to teach, and that the pay is acceptable, begin preparing a class as follows.;
, Develop a basic plan of what type of skill or project you would be confident teaching.

, Be careful not to use another person's class or pattern as the basis for the class without written consent. Violating a copyright is not just rude; it is illegal. Many quilt designers are happy for their work to be used, but always always always get that in writing.

, This may seem extreme at first, but for a well prepared teacher the time will fly. Plan a project that can be completed or well-started by a novice during six hours. If this class is a skill class, create some sort of project such as a cushion top, table runner, lap quilt or wall hanging using that skill.

, Make sure it actually goes together as expected! Keep precise notes of the steps used, and measurements and materials used. Most teachers provide some sort of notes or patterns for their students. The notes taken while making samples will make the hand-outs much easier to write.


Sometimes a partially finished project makes a good visual to teach some part of a technique. Create any visuals you may use in class.

, Write down exactly what students would need to bring to the class for the project. Remember to include things like extension cords for machines, spare needles, and cutting boards. Classes run more smoothly when students have all the tools they need to accomplish their project.

, Consider adding slightly more fabric than needed to allow for cutting errors.

, Start with greetings and introductions all round, perhaps include a brief chat of how you came to be a quilter and why this project is going to be fun and exciting. Starting with personal interaction and positive enthusiasm will help students relax and get class headed the right direction. the ""teacher"" class notes should break the project down into practical incremental steps.


These may not be referred to a great deal if you are very confident in your subject matter (which is fine) but be sure to look them over as you teach to ensure you are not forgetting anything essential.

, These may be as brief or as detailed as desired, but should include enough information for attendees to complete their project at home. It is also a good idea to list the class name, your name, email address and a copyright to each page of the notes. These notes reflect your personal style. They may be hand written or crafted on a computer, either way as long as they looks tidy.


Think of what kind of notes you would want from a class. Are they neat? Are they clear? Are they complete? Have someone who quilts proofread the student notes for typos or unclear areas.

, If practical - recruit a few (3 or 4) quilt friends to be a 'guinea pig' class before offering it to a shop or guild. This is an opportunity to find any part of the instruction that needs tweaking and also enables you to honestly say you have taught this class previously. A practice class is not essential, but thorough preparation is.

, Generally the proposal should include a cover letter introducing yourself, the class being proposing, as well as photos of the class samples and referrals from previous students. Again this is a representation of you, so make this as professional as possible

, Some things to discuss include class times, building access (door locks, alarms and such) access to additional supplies if needed, class size, chalkboard or wipe board, ironing boards, irons, lighting, electrical outlets, restroom facilities, food availability for lunch (usually) student parking, pay schedule (some pay before a certain date the next month - know ahead so there are no surprises). Also reimbursement for class notes or kits, if you are bringing hard to find supplies for the class.

, When a class is scheduled, provide venue with needs list to distribute to students.

, The day before the class ring the employer and confirm class numbers. Prepare sufficient notes/kits for the class.

, The day of the class arrive early and hang samples if possible. Make sure the room is tidy and inviting; if the temperature is extreme take measures to have that dealt with.

, To help remember names, draw a rough sketch of the seating (for instance 6 rectangles for 6 desks) and note names in relation to where students sit. Refer to it frequently and in a short time the names will roll easily off your tongue. It makes a difference to the class when students know you have taken time to learn their names.

, Teach the lesson keeping an eye on the faces of the students to see if they appear to be understanding. Encourage them to ask questions if they aren't sure about something.

, As students begin to work on their project, circulate the room. Looking at each person's efforts. If a student attempts to dominate your time excuse yourself with ""I just need to check on how so and so is doing…"" Some students will tootle along needing no help which makes them easy to ignore. Try to give each meaningful attention.

, If a student is doing something wrong, suggest with words like ""You might find this easier if you try to hold the fabric this way"" or ""Hey, I have a little technique that just might make that go together easier"" Attempt to downplay mistakes, and praise effort.


Be careful that overachievers don't make other students feel like the class is a race. There is always that one. When someone finishes something very quickly don't make a fuss.
Encourage those who need it. If a student seems overwhelmed or discouraged, spending a couple of minutes encouraging them is important. With warm smiles, confide in them of how often you have to re-do items. Reassure them it's normal!
Encourage a positive atmosphere. Keep the whole class experience as positive as possible, avoiding criticism of other tutors, groups or student (which just makes a person look petty) .

, When new information is being introduced make sure you have everyone's attention and that everyone can see if you are doing a demonstration.

, Make sure your students flex their necks and shoulders and wrists.

, Try to get photos of everyone and perhaps a group photo with the group showing their work. A collection of these photos will bring a smile years later!

, Thank the class for attending and encourage them to leave their email (with their name written beside it) so you can let them know about any future classes.

, Tidy the room and collect any lost and found items to give to the hosting venue.

Cut precisely.,
Check the accuracy of each strip against a ruler or tape measure.",How to Troubleshoot Mismatched Patchwork Pieces1," Check the cutting accuracy of your rotary cutter with this test:


Cut a 2 inch (5.1 cm) strip from a piece of scrap fabric.
Cut a 1 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) strip.
Cut a 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) strip.;
, If you find that there are inaccuracies in the cut strips, it may be one of these that your rotary cutter is not sharp enough or you are not holding it upright against the ruler as you cut.

"
"
Check the accuracy of the foot:


Cut two 6 inch (15.2 cm) squares using a rotary cutter.,
Check this seam against a ruler or tape measure.",How to Troubleshoot Mismatched Patchwork Pieces2,"
Stitch a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam.

, If there are problems, these could be the reasons why:


The seam is too short: allow a bit more fabric to show past the foot as you work it through the machine
The seam is too large: if you aren't feeding the fabric into the machine carefully enough, it can be helpful to make a guide marker 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) from the needle. You can do this using a dab of liquid paper or a bit of masking tape.
The guide on the machine might be causing the seam allowance to come down too much as you sew; if so, use your own sense of guidance instead.

Using 4"" squares, you will need approximately 115 squares to make a 60 x 84 inch quilt (15 x 21 squares).,
Gather around the 5"" square or make darts in the middle of two of the sides to fit the 4"" square.,
Turn right side out, carefully pulling the corners out.,
Distribute the stuffing evenly.,
When all your squares are finished, you can join them together by: slip stitching them together or use rickrack, braid or ribbon to join.

,
The quilt should have a backing.",How to Sew a Biscuit or Puff Quilt,";
, Place the two squares right side together and baste together at three of the edges (one side is left open to insert the stuffing).

, Fill with lightweight polyester filling. You can use old nylons or other stuffing but you will find your quilt very heavy when it is done. If you don't put in a generous amount of stuffing, you will find that you quilt flattens over time. Slip stitch the open end closed. (using a slip stitch makes the stitches invisible).

, For larger squares, it is recommended that you place a stitch in the center; two stitches with embroidery thread arranged in an x is easy and will keep your stuffing from slipping. If you have small squares, you will not need to do this.

,, Cut your backing from sheet material or satin, place it on top of the right side of the quilt, slip stitch around three of the outer edges, turn inside out so the right side of the quilt is showing and slip stitch the remaining edge. If you wish you can tack one or two x stitches throughout the quilt to hold the back in place.

",How to Prepare Patchwork Fabric for Use," This will ensure that no harm comes to the print or fabric type, as pure soap is gentle on fabric.;
, Not only does this step make the fabric easier to work with but it will also ensure that the fabric doesn't stretch out of shape as you work with it and it makes it easier to fit the pieces together.

Decide what sort of miniature quilts you're going to turn into kit versions.,
Assemble good quality tools and packaging.,
Use high quality fabrics for inclusion in the kit.,
Decide how much of the fabric you will cut for inclusion in the kit.,
After cutting the pieces, double count to make sure that every piece is there.,
Prepare the instructions for sewing the miniature quilt together.,
Prepare the packaging.",How to Make Miniature Quilt Kits for Selling," Importantly, do not copy any quilt design from copyrighted versions. Either design your own patterns from scratch or rely on patterns that are outside copyright due to their age (there are many choices). Also, do not copy any other miniature kit or any other craft kit; everything must be totally your own designs, instructions and marketing design.
, When making miniature quilt kits, you will need to have good tools to work with, especially good fabric scissors and rotary cutters, craft cutting boards and quilt or craft rulers for accurate measurements.

In addition, ensure that you have a large, clear workspace that won't be interrupted by other household activities. You will need to be able to use this space at any time and not find anything has been moved from it. However, if space is at a premium, you will need to develop a system that allows you to pack up everything neatly in order, so that it can be unpacked in the same order each time you return to it.

, The fabric should be able to do what the instructions require it to do and it shouldn't be a source of frustration for your customer owing to poor quality.

Select 100 percent cotton if using cotton and use quilt store quality fabric.
Pre-wash the fabric. This means that you can reassure the customer that any shrinkage likely to occur already has done so. Once cut, the fabric cannot be washed until made into a quilt, so spare your customer the hassle.
Store the fabric in a smoke-free environment and use this as part of your sales pitch. Nobody wants to buy cigarette infused fabric.

, Preferably, you will cut all pieces to size and shape, to save the customer having to do anything than sew; after all, that is the point of a kit. However, obviously there will be some patterns that make it better for the customer to cut, so explain clearly when this needs to be done.

Be sure to precision rotary cut the fabric. Ensure that cuts are absolutely accurate for piecing the quilt together.
If you include any pieces that still need cutting, have a very good reason for doing so, such as where there is leeway for the customer to make the miniature quilt to varying sizes of choice.
Anything else that needs cutting should be done with sharp, clean scissors, such as ribbon, backing, batting/padding, sashing, borders, etc.
If anything has been cut larger than what is needed, be sure to note this clearly on the instructions and explain what the customer needs to do before using the fabric.

, Have a checklist for every single kit that gets checked off as you go. Then insert into the kit bag., As part of the instructions, be sure to include:

Information on unusual stitches, including pictorial diagrams where this would help.
Any template sheet that might need to be followed or used.
Explain seam allowances for the sewing/piecing and how much it can be trimmed after sewing and pressing.
Sizes in both American and metric measurements. Both measurements are vital if selling online, as your kit could end up anywhere in the world if you're prepared to post overseas.
Level of challenge: easy, intermediate, hard, etc.
Include information about your returns policy in the package. It's a good idea to make the kit non-returnable for change of mind.

, Take a smart photo of the end result for showing on the front of the packaging. Around the photo, add marketing such as the name of the quilt, its size when completed, any interesting facts about the fabric used or the pattern style, where the kit was made and by whom (your brand).

Slip the whole kit into a quality plastic bag which seals at the top. Slide the promotion sheet in the front of all the other materials.
Ensure that all the materials are stacked in neatly and tightly to avoid bunching up during postage or display.

Cereal boxes work well for this.—They are often the perfect weight to cut easily yet be durable. Also, the price is right., The plastic might be cutting mats from the kitchen section of your local department store or, perhaps, the lid of a plastic container, say, a whipped topping container lid. Trace your pattern onto the plastic and carefully cut it out and... Voila!

,,, Match the middle of the borders with the middle of the quilt block, both top and bottom. That way, if there is an inch too much or too little on the sides, you can ease the border in or out as necessary, to make them both match each other. See the video demonstration for greater clarity on how to move the fabric into place., Measure again through the middle.







Cut two more border pieces. These must exactly match the middle.
Place these on the top and the bottom of the block, again easing to make sure that they fit properly.

Ornamental quilts are often used as wall hangings. These are usually not expected to be cleaned or laundered at all. If so, you may not have to prepare your fabric as rigorously as one destined for a bed. You can skip many steps, use fabrics that are delicate or do not wash well, and save quite a bit of time. But, if some well-meaning soul decides to wash a dusty commemorative quilt, it may well be ruined.
Functional quilts are meant to be used as bedding. As such, they will likely face washing, and perhaps put in a dryer. This doesn't mean it could not be used as decorative wall art, but it will require a bit more care in preparation.;
, If you are buying fabric, this will typically be labelled on the fabric bolt. Reclaimed clothes will usually have fabric content on the label.


Most quilts are typically made with a cotton, or cotton/polyester blend. These are usually the easiest to work with and launder.
Other fabrics, such as wool, silk, linen, and some other fabrics are usable, but may need special care if it will be washed. Sometimes fabrics (silk and wool especially) will have a ""finish"" that will change if washed in soap and water. This may not be a problem if you do not mind the change, or if it will be dry-clean only, or if it will only be decorative.
If you using an unknown fabric, you run a risk of having it act unpredictably upon laundering. Usually nothing horrible happens. However, fabrics are known to do everything from change color, spot, to run color over the rest of the quilt, fray, even melt in a hot dryer.

, You will want any shrinkage to happen now rather than after the quilt is made!


Launder the fabric in the hottest washing setting recommended for your fabric.
Cottons, cotton/poly blends, and linen: HOT
Silk, Wool: COOL or COLD (Note: Silk will not shrink much, but wool is very prone to shrinkage. But do not try to purposely shrink it as cottons, because it hot water will damage wool in a way it does not with cottons.)
Polyester, other synthetic fibers: HOT (Note: These fabrics generally do not shrink, but it is good to confirm your fabrics can handle a hot bath if it happens again)

,


Dry your fabric in the hottest dryer setting recommended.
Cottons, cotton/polyester, and linen: HOT (Note: If possible, use a commercial laundry dryer, as these generally reach higher temperature than home dryers.)
Silk, Wool: LOW
Polyester, other synthetic fibers: Medium or HOT

, Doing so helps assure fabric is uniform in consistency and makes the fabric easier to work with.


Fleece fabrics should not be ironed.
Be sure you use the setting recommended on your iron.
Many quilters like to use starch or other product to stiffen the fabric, in order to make it easier to work with. This is optional.

, Be sure it is stored neatly. If it is left in a heap, it may re-develop wrinkles. Ideally, re-wrap it on a bolt or piece of cardboard to prevent creases, but folding it is better than having to re-do all your work.

, After you cut your fabric, serge the raw edges of the pieces. (Optional)


This step helps avoid fabrics fraying, moving off-grain, and lengthen the life of the quilt.
This adds significantly to the time creating the quilt.
Many quilters do not serge any raw edges and get decades of use from quilts that are used and washed regularly.

Buy good fabric.,
Buy a dark, medium and light coordinated colored fabric.,

,
Add your backing.,
Bind your quilt.,
Sign your quilt on the back neatly.",How to Make an Art Quilt," Often times discounted fabrics will take away from the over-all look of your quilt.
, Some solids and patterned fabric will make a good addition.

, You should think of something simple. A well-designed flower, fish or tree is just as interesting as something much more complex. Try to ""tell a story"" is it a tree in your yard (with specific details) or one in the woods?, A smaller size quilt is more manageable for a beginner. Choose a solid or small print for background. Any color is possible. Use fabrics that work well in design and size. Make art quilting fun., Iron with the fusible on the back of the fabric (sticky side down.) Don't press forever as this is a two step process. The fusible, will adhere to the back of the fabric. You can draw shapes on the side of white paper, and then it will be stuck to the back of your fabric, You need to peel off the white paper and re-iron the shapes where you want them placed. Fabric shapes can be laid on the background and later sewn on to secure. Fabric layered on top with the edges sewn down by a single stitch is called raw edge applique. You can also try the zig-zag stitch on your machine or a running stitch if doing all hand work. Try laying down several layers. Remember that layering creates depth and shadowing.

It is also possible to use scraps and leftover fabric for an abstract but interesting look. Sew two or three strips of fabric the same size of different solids, small and large prints, Iron each strip and cut them up and reassemble them.







,,, A backing fabric should be sewn attaching all of the layers., Use a strip of fabric 2.5-inch pressed into a long narrow strip. You will need two for the length and two for the width of your quilt. The open end is sewn down on the front of quilt edges and flipped to the back side. Carefully pin binding strip to the quilt surface and hold the strip in place and re-sew the folded part down. Trim these to the length of the quilt. Have about 3/4 to one inch of extra fabric to tuck in at the top and bottom on the width of the binding. These should be neatly done corners. The binding colors should compliment the quilt. Sewing of the binding can also be done with a bias strip by machine or hand.
, Make a 2-4"" sleeve to hang it on to the wall. A sleeve (think narrow tube of fabric) is sewn into the top edge to insert a dowel or flat stick hung across the quilt. The sleeve is about 1-inch short of the back of the quilt- side to side. Hand stitch the tube down, and make a hanger from wire. A nail should be enough to hang a smaller quilt."

Select fabrics of similar weights and complimentary colors.,
Calculate the desired area of your finished quilt.,
Cut the fabric into 7-inch squares (17.78 cm).",How to Make a Rag Quilt1," For the best results, you need fabric that will fray, so consider 100 percent cotton or denim for your rag quilt.









Make sure if you are using old material from around the home or the bottom of your quilting box that you have enough to complete the whole quilt.;
, Multiply the length times the width. Divide that number by 7 to determine how many squares you will need.









Divide the number of squares by 6. This assumes a fabric width of 45 inches (114.3 cm). Multiply that number by 7 to determine how many inches of fabric length you will need; divide that by 12 for the yards. If your fabric is 60 inches wide (152.4 cm), divide the number of squares by 9.

Have we lost you? Basically, each square will be six inches wide and six inches long. If your quilt is ten rows across and 15 rows down, that's 60 inches wide by 90 inches long.



, The actual size of the finished squares will be 6 inches (15.24 cm); 7 inches allots for the seam.









If the finished size of your quilt is not evenly divisible by 6, enlarge or reduce the size of the squares to fit, allowing an extra inch (2.54 cm) for seam allowances.

You could always work with different sizes of squares or a larger or smaller quilt--just make sure you factor in the seam to your final size; you lose an inch on either side with each square.

Place two squares together with the wrong sides up.,
Add another square to the side of the pair you have just stitched.,
Make more strips in the same width.,
Sew the strips together.,
Wash the quilt to start the fraying of the seams.",How to Make a Rag Quilt2," Stitch them, using a 1/2-inch (1.27 cm) seam allowance. Unlike the usual sewing project, the wrong sides are together so that the seams will be visible on top of the squares.









You are welcome to use a smaller seam, but that will result in less of a fraying effect.

, Continue until you have reached the width that you want for your quilt. Remember to keep it wrong side up!









Machine sewing is usually the fastest and best way to quickly and simply quilt these blocks.
Using a walking foot will help the fabric be more stable so tucks and puckers don't occur.

, Do this until you have used all the squares, which should be enough for the length you want for your quilt.









Always sew with the raw seam towards the top of the quilt. It is a good idea to sew the seams open as this will reduce the bulk of sewing over seams that are turned to one side.

, Again, keep the wrong sides of the fabric together. Sometimes it's a hard habit to break!









After you have sewn all your strips together, sew an inch inside the outer border all around the quilt.

, You can also speed up the process by pulling cross threads out of the squares.









Take scissors to the edges of your fraying seams to give it a uniform, ruffled edge.
Pop it in the dryer! This will help the seams become soft and fluffy.

a sewing machine
plenty of thread
scissors
a tape measure
batting material
material for the inside of your quilt
safety pins
straight pins
iron (optional);
, A jelly roll quilt is named for the pre-cut strips that you use to make the quilt. These strips are usually arranged by color and come wrapped up in a roll. You can sew the strips together in the order they are in, or you can go through the stack and separate the colors a bit more.








Separating the colors will result in a more random color pattern for your quilt. If you prefer a blocky color look, then do not separate the strips. Just sew in the order they are in.
Unroll your strips and then divide the strips into piles of similar colors. Then, you can take one strip from each pile in a sequence as you sew the strips together.

, Next, you will need to sew the ends of your strips together to start making the quilt top. Take two different color strips and sew the short ends together. Make sure that the right sides (print or color sides) of the material are facing each other. Then, take a third strip and sew the short end to the short end of the second strip. Then, take a fourth strip and sew the short end to the short end of the third strip.








Continue sewing the strips together in this fashion until you have connected all of the strips. When you are done, you will have one long, thin strip made up of all of your small jelly roll strips.
Do not worry about trimming the strings in between strips as you sew. It will be quicker and easier if you trim these strings after you finish sewing.

, After you have finished connecting all of the strips, go back through and cut the threads between each of the strip ends. Cutting this thread will allow you to extend the long strip you have created to its full length.







, Cutting 18 inches off of your last strip will help to ensure that the seams are not side-by side when you sew your strips together.Measure from the end of the strip and then use your scissors to trim off the last 18 inches of the end strip. Discard the piece that you cut off.







, Fold the right sides of your strip together so that the two short ends meet. Then, start sewing along the long edge of your strip. Sew about 1








Make sure that the long edges are lined up and even as you sew. You can tug the fabric now and then to ensure that it is taut.

, After you have sewed along the entire edge of the fabric and reach the other short end, you will need to cut along the fold on the short end. Cut just until you reach the seam that you have just sewn. Then, open up the fabric to its new width.







, You will need to continue to fold the strip so that the two shortest ends meet, sew along the long edge, and cut along the fold until your quilt top has 32 rows and is about 50 inches wide.Each time you sew an edge, it will be half as short as the last edge you sewed, so after the first couple of edges, the sewing will start to go more quickly.








Each time you fold and sew, you will be doubling the width of your quilt top. For example, you start with one row and then double to two rows, then four rows, then eight rows, then 16 rows, and, finally, to 32 rows.

, Place your quilt top right side down, which means that the colorful print side of your jelly roll quilt top needs to be facing down. Make sure that that the surface you use is flat, clean, and dry. Smooth out the quilt top.If the quilt top is bunching up then you can use some duct tape to secure it at the corners and ensure that it is fully extended.

, Use your tape measure to find the dimensions of your quilt top. Your quilt’s width should be about 50 inches, but this may vary. Measure the width and length of your quilt top to be sure how much fabric your will need for the batting and inner facing fabric.

, Once you have the measurements of your quilt top, you can measure and cut your batting fabric, inner facing fabric, and border fabric to match your quilt top’s dimensions. Cut the batting fabric and the inner facing fabric to the same dimensions as your quilt top. Cut two three-inch wide strips the same length as your quilt top and two three-inch long strips the same width as your quilt top.


Your batting fabric will go inside of the quilt, directly behind the quilt top.
Then, your inner facing fabric will be on the underside of your quilt, directly over the batting on the other side.Your border strips will go on the outer edges of your quilt.

, You will need to sandwich the batting between your quilt top and inner facing fabric.Lay the batting fabric down on the wrong side of the quilt top. Then, cover the batting with the inner facing fabric for the underside of your quilt.


If your inner facing fabric has a print, then make sure that the print is facing upwards.

, It is a good idea to use safety pins rather than straight pins because you have to make sure that the materials stay put while you sew. If they shift while you are sewing then it can throw off the entire design.


Pin through all three layers of your fabric.
Start pinning in the center and move outwards.
Make sure that you smooth out the fabric as you go.
You can also place binder clips on the outer edges of the quilt to help keep the edges together., Starting in the center will help to ensure that there are no lumps in the center of your quilt. Start in the center and sew in a straight line out to the edge of the quilt. Then, return to the center and sew out towards another edge.Smooth out the quilt often and hold it taut as you sew to prevent lumps and bumps.
Continue to sew from the center out to the edges until you have covered all areas of your quilt with stitches that are about three to four inches apart.
Sew around your safety pins or remove them right before you sew over an area that has a safety pin in it.
Remove any remaining pins when you are finished.

, Take one of your three-inch wide strips that is the same length as your quilt top. Then, fold over about ¼” to ½” of the border fabric on one of the long edges. If you want to ensure that this edge will be nice and straight, then you can iron it.However, you can also pin it straight onto your quilt edge and begins sewing.


Pin the folded edge of your long strip to the long edge of your quilt beginning about one inch in from the edge. Use safety pins to do this and make sure that the fabric goes all the way through the materials.
Then, start at one end and sew along the edge of the quilt to secure the border in place. Make sure that you hold the fabric tight and smooth it out as you go. Remove each the safety pins right before you sew over them.
Repeat the same process on the other side of the quilt edge. Fold over the fabric, pin it, and then sew it into place.
Add borders for the other three edges when you are done with the first edge.
After you have added the borders, your jelly roll quilt is complete!

Accumulate scraps of fabric.,
Find a pattern.,
Settle on the quilt pattern you want to use.",How to Make a Patchwork Quilt1," These could be from your other sewing projects, old dresses, or fabrics from family and friends. Save these for your patchwork quilt.


Depending on your tastes, these could be all of one uniform size or of varying sizes and shapes. Think of how the pieces would form into a whole. Try to have at least 6 different patterns.;
, Look through the Internet (Google Books is a good place to start) and craft books for a pattern that suits your interests or create your own by deciding what you want your quilt to look like.


Quilt designs take small pieces of fabric and create a collage look of one part of the blueprint of one design. The pieces are generally no smaller than a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square and may be much larger, depending upon your chosen design.

, Then, cut out pieces of fabric that will provide the colors and patterns you need. A good pair of scissors will be of great use here.


Make sure to allot for a 1/4"" (1.25 cm) seam allowance on all sides. If you want 2"" squares, make your squares 2.5"" on all sides.

Of course, you don't have to use squares. Rectangles and triangles will work, too.


Form your pattern on the floor. It's a lot easier to arrange your quilt when it's not sewn together. Arrange the pieces in the exact order you want them. In addition to seeing how the colors fit together, you'll see how big your quilt is and if you're happy with the size.

Sew your rows to each other.",How to Make a Fleece Quilt," Fleece quilts are made by putting together squares of fleece. Before you can make your blanket, you need to know how big you want your blanket to be. This will determine the amount of fleece you need for the blanket. The size of your square will dictate the number of rows and columns and the overall number of squares needed for each blanket. For example, if you use a 10 inch square, you can get 12 squares out of a yard.

This is based on the common height of 44"" for the fabric.
A twin quilt is 68 x 88 inches. You need to make a 7 column by 9 row quilt. For this size, you need approximately 5 1/4 yards of fleece.
A full quilt is 81 x 88 inches. You need to make a 8 column by 9 row blanket. For this size, you need approximately 6 yards of fleece.
A queen quilt is 88 x 96. You need to make a 9 column by 10 row blanket. For this size, you need approximately 7 1/2 yards of fleece.
A king quilt is 107 x 108. You need to make a 11 column by 11 row blanket. For this size, you need approximately 10 1/8 yards of fabric.;
, You need to decide what colors you want in your blanket. If you want it all one color, then you need to get enough of that one fabric to make the whole blanket. If you are using multiple colors or patterns, you need to buy enough of each color to make part of the blanket.

For example, if you are using 5 different colors, divide the overall number of yards of fabric you need by 5. If you are making the king quilt, you will need to have a little over 2 yards of each color., Go to your local craft store. Look through the fabric and pick out your favorite colors or designs of fleece that you want to incorporate into your quilt. Pick as many colors and designs as you want. Just make sure the total amount of fleece you buy amounts to what you need., Now that you have your chosen fleece material, you need to cut out the squares for your quilt. For example, if you are making the full quilt, you will need 72 squares in all. Pick a sturdy piece of cardboard and cut it into a perfect 10 x 10 square. Use that as the stencil. Cut the necessary amount of fleece squares from all the different fleece you bought.

The amount of each design of fleece you need will depend on how many different designs you bought. It helps is you buy an amount of designs that can be evenly divided into the number of squares you need. For example, if you bought 3 different designs for the full quilt, you will need 24 squares of each design. If you bought 6, you will need 12 of each design. However, if you bought 5 kinds of fleece, you would need 14 of 3 of the designs and 15 of the last 2., To make the no-sew quilt, you have to tie together your squares by hand. To do this, you have to add fringe on the edges of the squares. Mark a line 1 inch from the edge of the square on each side of the square. Starting from the edge that you marked, take a sharp pair of scissors and cut slits to the 1 inch line into the fleece. Continue all along the sides at even intervals of about 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch across. Once you hit the edge of one side, turn the fleece 90 degrees to start on the next side. Continue along all sides of all the squares.

The corners of each square will be cut off during this process as the slits from each side meet each other in the same spot., Now that you have all of your squares cut, you need to layout your blanket pattern. If your blanket is all one color, you can skip this step. If you have multiple colors, you need to decide on a design. There are many different options. You can make stripes, checkerboards, a rainbow, or a random pattern. Lay out your squares in whatever pattern you want across the floor or a large table.

Decide what is best for you. It is a personal choice and will depend on the number of different designs you have., Now you can start assembling your rows. Take two fleece squares that are beside each other in a row of your design. Lay them side by side with the fringe touching. Take the top piece of fringe on the sides of the squares that are touching. Double knot the fleece fringe together. Continue down the whole side of the square. Once two are connected, take the next square in the row sequence of your blanket. On the opposite side of where the two squares are already connected, attach the next square in the same way as the first. Continue this until your row is completely knotted together. Do the same thing for the remaining rows of your blanket.Make sure you don't pull too much fabric through when you are knotting the fringe. It will cause your fleece to cinch and mess up the flow of the whole quilt., Once you have all your long rows attached together, you need to attach the rows together to finish the blanket. Starting in the same fashion as with the singular squares, knot the fringe of the rows together. Continue all the way down the rows until the two are attached together. Do the same thing for the remaining rows. Once the last rows are joined, you should have a complete blanket., If you want to sew together a blanket instead, you first need to decide what kind of pattern you want your blanket to have. Lay out your squares in the desired pattern on the floor or a large table. There are various options to choose from. You can make checkerboards, a rainbow, stripes, or a random pattern. Any pattern works as long as you like it., Once you have your pattern laid out, you can start to sew together your squares. Take two squares and place them on top of one another. Make sure the edges match up. Using a 2-3 inch stitch and a 12/80 or 14/90 universal needle on your sewing machine, sew along the edge of the fleece. Your seam allowance, which is the amount of fleece you allow out of the seam, can be as big or as small as you want. If you want fringed edges, sew about 1/2 inch from the edge. If you want a mostly flat surface, sew as close to the edge as you can without losing the strength of the stitch.

Do this for every square in your row. Then, sew together all of the remaining squares into rows., Now that you have all of your rows sewn together, sew the rows to one another using the same seam allowance as you did on the squares within each row. Continue to do this for each row until all of your rows are sewn together. Your blanket is now complete.

If you left more of a seam allowance between your squares, you can make them into fringe. Use scissors to cut the edges evenly. This will leave lines of fringe along the outside of each square."

You can choose matching fabric for both sides, or you can mix patterns and types of fabric for the bottom and top. Consider how you plan to use your quillow and who it is for. A baseball fan might like a pattern with bats and mitts or the logo of his favorite team; a dog lover might appreciate a pattern of little paw prints. Use your creativity!

For a blanket that will cover an adult, you will need 2 pieces of fabric that is 2 yards (1.8 m) long and 60 inches (150 cm) in width, plus an additional 1⁄2 yard (0.5 m) for the pillow.For a baby blanket, buy two 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric. Trim these later to crib size (usually 36 inches b 44 inches) and use the remaining fabric for the pillow.Fleece, flannel, or cotton fabric are good choices to make warm, cozy blankets. You may also find soft, plush fabrics perfect for baby.If you plan to use your quillow for picnics, consider making one side of the blanket water-proof with either water-proof fabric or a heavy vinyl shower curtain. This will help keep your blanket dry in wet grass and make it easier to clean off dirt and sand.;
, This is the insulation or padding you layer between your top and bottom pieces of fabric. Look for a high-quality batting that won't separate and isn't too thick, or you may have trouble folding your quilt into the pocket.Get the same size batting as your fabric (or bigger--you will trim it down).
Cotton batting is a popular choice because it is breathable and ages well, plus it's machine washable. If you're looking for cotton batting with a little more ""poof,"" look for one with scrim or a cotton/polyester blend.Wool batting is durable and is a great choice for a blanket you want to be extra-warm. It is a little more expensive than other batting, and you must be very careful when washing, or it will clump up inside your blanket.Polyester batting is inexpensive and will retain it's shape, making it ideal for a baby blanket, since it will be washed regularly. It's a little more more ""poofy"" than wool or cotton, so don't get one that is too thick., Unless you're looking for contrast, you want your stitches to blend in with the colors of the blanket., If the dimensions of your fabric aren't already the size you'd like, lay the fabric flat and use a yard stick and rotary cutter to cut through the fabric.

Place a self-healing matt under the fabric before you cut. This will make it easier to slice through and won't damage the table or floor underneath.
If you aren't sure about the dimensions of the pillow pocket, find the measurement for 1/4 of the length of the main blanket, then add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to that number. Then find 1/3 of the width of the main blanket, and add 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to that number.Remember you will lose roughly between 1/8-1/4 of an inch when you sew the quilt together, depending on the seam.

, The ""right"" side refers to the side of the fabric that will be exposed, or the side with the pattern on it.,
Leave a 12 inch (30.5 cm) opening somewhere along the edge.

,

If you have trouble sewing a straight line, mark the 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) seam with a colored pencil or ""invisible"" marking pen that rinses out with a little water.You may choose to zig-zag stitch the raw edges as well if you think the blanket will be frequently laundered or get a lot of rough use.Use sharp scissors to trim off the four corners with a diagonal cut. Don't clip your stitches!Press the edges with a hot iron to lock the stitches and increase the durability of your blanket., Reach in through the opening and use a pencil to push out your corners.Smooth out the quilt and iron to the edges. Pressing your quilt will ensure a neat, polished look when you are finished.Fold in the raw edges of the 12 inch (30.5 cm) opening so it is even with the rest of the blanket and press it with the iron. Pin it closed, with the excess fabric (or raw edge) tucked into the opening.

, This final seam secures the edges of the quilt so it will last longer. It also gives the blanket a neat, professional look.This 1/4 seam should be between the edge of the blanket and the 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) seam you already sewed.
You can skip the final seam and just sew the opening shut with a 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) seam, but the blanket won't be quite as durable and the edges may not look quite as clean., Make sure the edges are lined up and pinned before you begin stitching. You are making a mini-version of the main blanket, only without the batting.One side of the rectangle should still be open so you can flip the fabric right-side out.
Snip off the corners with scissors. This gives your pocket nice, sharp edges.

, Again, reach into the opening and use a pencil to push out the corners.

Press the fabric with a warm iron, locking the stitches and smoothing out any wrinkles.Fold the open side of the rectangle so its is even with the edge of the rest of the pillow pocket. Use the iron to crease the fold and pin the opening closed., You will be sewing these edges later, when you attach them to the large blanket., The edge of the pocket you already stitched with a 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seam should be lined up with the edge of the large blanket. Pin the pocket in place.The top of the blanket is one of the shorter sides of the rectangular blanket (the width). If you made a square blanket, the top is whichever side you choose.
Measure the blanket on either side of the pillow pocket, making sure it is in the exact center on the edge of the blanket (not the exact middle of the entire blanket).You can sew the pocket on the front or back of the main blanket. It will be concealed if you sew it on the side that is on the ground. If the pillow pocket is on the front of the blanket, you can use it as a storage pocket while the blanket is in use., Do not sew the edge of the pillow pocket that is lined up with the edge of the blanket, or you will have no pocket in which to tuck your blanket!, The pocket is at the ""top"" of the blanket., You are folding the blanket into thirds, lengthwise. The blanket should be longer than it is wide, and be the width of the pillow pocket.If you were to flip the blanket over now, the pillow pocket would be fully visible, with the open edge at the top.

,, To do this, reach one hand into the pillow pocket and grab hold to the edge that is sewn to the blanket. Hold the open edge of the pillow pocket with your other hand. Pull the inside edge of the pillow pocket toward you while simultaneously pulling or flipping the free edge away from you and around the folded blanket.

It may help to think of it this way: the pillow pocket is being flipped inside out and you are stuffing the blanket into the flipped pocket.
It may take a few tries to get the hang of the flip.

,, It should pop out of the pillow easily."

Sew the cut pieces of your quilt top together.,
Press the quilt top with an iron.,
Use single-fabric backing for your quilt.,
Smooth the quilt batting over the top of the fabric.,
Place the quilt top next, face up.,
Start sewing it all together.",How to Make a Patchwork Quilt2," Go strip by strip. You can use a sewing machine or do it by hand, if you trust your stitches - and if you have the patience.


Once you have all your strips sewn, then sew the strips together. It'll be easiest to get each strip together first instead of patching it together haphazardly.
Make sure the sides of the fabric are all facing the right side! Printed sides need to be together. If you're using a sewing machine, make sure your foot is set at 1/4"".

, Set it at the temperature appropriate for your fabric. Flatten the seams to be sure the quilt will have a straight look when completed.

, It needs to be 8 inches (20.32 cm) wider and longer than the finished quilt top. A fabric store will cut it for you, but you may need to buy two long pieces and sew them together.


Lay out the backing in an area where you can spread out your work. Place it face down on the floor. The pretty side should be facing away from you.
Put the backing down on the floor or a large, wide table. Place the better side of the fabric face down. Spread the backing out evenly.
Tape the top and bottom to the floor using masking tape, smoothing out wrinkles as you go, before taping each side down. It's important to get this as smooth and wrinkle-free as possible, without pulling the fabric so tight that natural line of it is distorted.

Once you are happy with that, take some Quilter's 505 and spray it liberally over the fabric.



, The batting will tend to hold creases from where it was folded, but as long as you have smoothed them out, don't worry that the crease lines are still visible (as above). Batting does not need to be ironed.


Spray another layer of 505 on the batting.

, It all needs to be flat with no wrinkles. You'll notice that the quilt top is smaller than the bottom two layers - this is intentional as otherwise it is very hard to align the layers perfectly. Smooth out any wrinkles, until your quilt top sits perfectly flat.


Pin the sections together at a distance of 6 inches (15.24 cm) apart. You can use as many or as few pins as you'd like. Start pinning from the center and work your way outward, pinning in concentric circles. This means that any extra fabric is pushed to the outer of the quilt, rather than being allowed to bunch up toward the centre.

Once everything is pinned, unpeel the masking tape, freeing the quilt from the floor.



, How you quilt the layers together is very much down to personal preference and accomplished quilters often use a free-motion stitch that undulates across the quilt in loops and swirls. However, by far the most simple method is to 'stitch-in-the-ditch'. This simply means to machine across the quilt so that your stitches fall into the 'ditch' created where two fabrics have joined at a seam.


Tack the pieces together at the pins or apply around patterns in the quilt with contrasting thread to match the fabric. You will also need to tack a couple of stitches in the middle of each square keep the backing and top from slipping.
Once the quilt is fully quilted, you can then square up the quilt, cutting off the unwanted bits of backing and batting that show around the edges.

Cut binding strips.,
Align the binding.,
Sew exactly 1/2"" (2.5 cm) from the long edge.",How to Make a Patchwork Quilt3," This all depends on the size of your quilt. A good starting point is around 2.5"" (6.25 cm) wide. These will form a smooth border around the edges of your quilt.


Cut enough strips to surround your quilt. The end product needs to be a bit longer than your quilt to overlap on both sides.
If you don't have four long strips, sew the strips together to cover the length of the quilt.

, With right-sides-together (this means face-to-face), align the binding strip with the top edge of the quilt and then pin along the long edge of the quilt.

, Sew from one end of the quilt to the other. When you reach the end, carefully cut the excess binding off, so that the bottom of the binding aligns perfectly with the bottom of the quilt.


Repeat for the opposing side and then again for the other two.

,, It is advisable to use a screen made from nylon or fibreglass between the vacuum and the quilt which will prevent the quilt from being sucked up into the vacuum. First wash the screen in soapy water and rinse well and dry. Cover the edges of the screen with tape to prevent any snagging or abrasions., Once you have aired the quilt wrap the quilt in a muslin bag. Avoid either the charcoal or cedarwood to come into direct contact with the quilt when storing., If your quilts are genuine, meaning fifty years or older, it is not recommended that you clean the quilt at home. Quilts are usually made from complex materials as there are usually two layers comprising of the fabric, batting or fibre fill and special quilting thread. Antique quilts in particular may present with problems as they have their own characteristics, and precaution should be heeded. When it comes to historic quilts even the professionals are hesitant to clean them., When handing the quilt in for cleaning, remember to tell the dry cleaner the age of the quilt and to use a short cleaning cycle., The best method and safest method to clean the quilt would be to air the quilt only., Always protect your quilts from coming into contact with wood or metal. Never store quilts in plastic bags as this may cause mildew or attract insects., Never roll the quilt, and store in around fifty percent humidity in other words room temperature. Never store them in basements or attics."

Choose the fabrics you like.,

Lay the fabrics out the way you want them.,

Sew the fabrics together with right sides (printed side) facing so that the seams will be hidden when finished.,

Cut the fabric mosaic to size.
,Repeat for a second piece of mosaic fabric, the same size as the first.,
Top stitch the seams with funky, bright thread.,


Sew both sides of your pillow together, leaving 4-5 inches (10-12.5 cm) of seam unsewn for turning ""right side"" out.

Gather your materials.,
Pick your fabric.,
Try to get a quilting kit.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)1," To get started on your first quilt, you'll need to have everything ready and easily accessible. Get all your tools, clear an area and let's get started. You'll need:


Rotary cutter
Scissors
Ruler
Thread (multiple kinds)
Cutting mat
Seam ripper
Pins;
, Different kinds of fabric wear differently over time -- so it's best not to blend. Sticking to cottons will probably be your best bet. What's more, think about color and scale -- not thinking it out may result in a quilt that seems flat and off-kilter.


Stay in the same color family, but don't use the exact same shades -- your quilt will seem monochrome and dull. Think about lights and brights, bolds and darks, and avoid ones that are a bit matchy-matchy.
Don't pick fabrics that are all small or large prints. A good variety of both will create a dynamic, vivid piece. You may want to pick one fabric and base the rest around that specific pattern.
Consider having a ""zinger"" fabric. It's one that is significantly brighter than the rest and, as a result, makes the entire quilt pop.

You'll also need fabric for the back, the border, binding, and the batting.
If you stick to high-quality 100% cotton quilting fabrics that come from the independent shops or the higher-end selection at JoAnn, Hancock, etc., you should not have a problem with colors bleeding, etc. If the fabric is older or lower-quality, prewash before you start cutting.



, A beginner must have a quilting kit to make learning easier. Quilting kits are packaged sets of materials to make a piece of work. They ordinarily include a pattern, pre-cut fabrics and instruction. However, they do not include thread, quilt backing and batting.


Be sure the kit is for the appropriate skill level. Most kits are marked with level skills. Some are designed to fit the needs of unskilled beginners, usually for a wall hanging to start with before undertaking a full-size quilt. An alternative to a quilt kit is to buy jelly roll only which is a rolled up collection of coordinating fabric strips. One roll can make a small quilt like a wall hanging.

Gather your materials.,
Determine your fabric needs.",How to Make an American Quilt1," It's much easier to sit down and relax for an afternoon's quilting session if you have everything within reach of your comfy chair. Get everything together, grab a glass of lemonade, and let's get started. You'll need:


Red, white, and blue fabric
Needle and thread
Pins
Tailor's chalk or pencil
Measuring tape
Iron
Scissors
Quilt batting
Embroidery floss;
, This quilt is made up of sets of 9 blocks, three squares across. Each square is 2 inches (5 cm) across and wide. There is a 1 inch (2.5 cm) border along all sides, including the edges. So, it's 8 inches (20 cm) for each block, and then an extra 1 1/2"" (3.8 cm) for the end borders. Knowing this, how many squares do you need for your quilt?


If you want a quilt that's 8 feet (2.4 m) (2.4 m) long, that's 96 inches. The closest you'll get is 12 blocks (12 x 8 = 96), plus an extra 1 1/2"" for the border (97.5 inches in total).
If you want a quilt that's 6 feet (1.8 m) wide, that's 72 inches. Great! That's 9 8-inch blocks, plus an extra border = 73.5 inches. So, a 8x6 quilt requires 108 blocks. If each block is 9 squares of fabric, that's 972 little squares of red, white, and blue. Wow. That's super patriotic of you.

Learn the stitches used.,
Learn the terms for the layers of the quilt.,
Learn the terms used for the fabric pieces that are added to a quilt.,
Learn the terms related to joining the quilt together.,
Keep a notebook with the terms written down.,
Read quilting sites and magazines to learn more.",How to Know Quilting Terminology," For the most part, the stitches are probably already known to you. Some of the important ones are:



Backstitch: This is a reinforcing stitch made at the beginning and end of a seam to keep stitches in place.

Basting: These are the large running stitches that you use to tack together fabric pieces or layers temporarily. This gets removed once the permanent stitching is in place.

Seam: This refers to the line of stitches that forms when you sew together two pieces of fabric.
Seam allowance: This refers to the distance or space between the seam and the cut edge of the fabric. Most quilts will have a standard seam allowance of a quarter inch.;
, These are useful terms to learn early:


Backing: This is the base or bottom layer of each quilt.
Batting: This forms the middle layer of the quilt. It's the part that provides the insulation (warmth) and the thickness of the quilt.
Quilt top: This is the top layer of the quilt. This is where all the decorative elements of the quilt are shown. It sits over the batting and the backing.

, Many patterns will refer to these terms.


Binding: This is the fabric strip that is used to enclose raw edges of a quilt. The edges can also be finished off using binding, depending on the style of the quilt being made.
Border: The border is formed by strips of fabric in order to frame the quilt top.
Fat quarter: This refers to a pre-cut square of quilt fabric that can be themed in colors, patterns, styles, etc.
Quilt blocks: This refers to the sections that are sewn together to form the quilt top.
Sashing: The sashing means the strips of fabric that separate the individual blocks in a quilt top.
Selvages: This refers to the two tightly woven edges of fabric that go lengthwise along the quilt.
Setting squares: These are the squares of pieced fabric that are placed between pieced blocks on the quilt top.
Strip set: The strip set consists of two or more strips of fabric sewn together along the long edges, following which they are cut apart across the width of the sewn strips. This turns them into smaller pieces or ""units"".
Units: Units are the fabric pieces that have been sewn together to form a sub-group. Units can form blocks on the quilt or might be used in other ways as directed by the pattern.

, These are handy terms, so that your quilt can sit correctly and be pieced together!


Bias: This refers to the grain of fabric either crosswise or lengthwise. True bias is 45º.
Chain piecing: This method is used on a sewing machine. It involves joining pairs or pieces one after another by feeding them through the sewing machine without cutting the thread between the pairs.
Grain: This refers to the direction in which the threads sit in woven fabric. Crosswise grain means the threads run from selvage to selvage, while lengthwise grain means the threads running parallel to the selvage.
Piecing: This is the act of sewing together the pieces of the quilt top in order to form a quilt block or the whole design of the quilt.
Pin basting: This is the method for pinning together the quilt prior to machine stitching it. Always use pins that cannot rust, especially if you're not working on the quilt that frequently or you live somewhere with high humidity.
Quilting lines: These are the designs drawn directly on the fabric. A suitable fabric marker is used (perhaps even an invisible marker that fades) and you can follow these as a guidance as you quilt.
Set or setting: These terms refer to the arrangement of quilt blocks as they're sewn together to form the top of the quilt.
Straight grain: This is the crosswise or lengthwise grain of fabric. Be aware that the least give occurs on the lengthwise grain.
Triangle square: This refers to two right triangles joined on their long sides. Doing so forms a square with a diagonal seam.

, At first it can take some time to remember the meanings of the principal terms as you work through a pattern. It can be helpful to keep a dedicated notebook to remind yourself what each term means until it becomes habit for you.

, There are many specific terms for the range of quilt styles and techniques. The best way to learn all the relevant terms is to read widely in the area of quilting (while enjoying the photos of completed quilts) and you'll find that it won't take long to pick up all the relevant terms.

"
"
Pick a design.,
Start cutting your fabrics.,
Arrange your pieces.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)2," You'll need to know how big you want your quilt to be and how you want to lay out your pieces. At this point, it'll be easiest to work with squares.


You can think in large squares or you can think in smaller squares that make up larger blocks. Look at the materials you have on hand and see what arrangement they lend themselves to.

, Grab your rotary cutter and start having fun. You'll need to do some math, though -- seam allowances and overall size need to be considered.


You'll need a 1/4"" (.6 cm) allowance on all sides of each piece of fabric. So if you want a 4"" (10 cm) square, cut out a 4 1/2"" (11.25 cm) square. If you want 4 squares to compose 1 4"" block, each small square should be 2 1/2"" (6.25 cm) across.

, It'll be much easier to arrange the entire quilt now than to piece them together in the middle of sewing later. Clear a space on the floor to see what your finished piece will look like.


You'll want to see how each piece of fabric fits next to the ones around it. Piecing out the entire thing will help you avoid clumps of one color or one scale. You'll also be able to see how big the finished product will be.

"
"
Start sewing rows.,
Press the fabrics.,
Sew the rows together.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)3," Grab the arrangement of fabrics you have placed on the floor and put each row into a pile, going left to right. You may want to grab a piece of tape or somehow indicate which row is which.


Take the square you have on top and lay it pretty side up. Then, pick up your second square and lay it face down on top of your first square. Pin the right sides together.
With your machine, sew the squares together with a ¼” (.6 cm) seam allowance. You'll probably want to line up the edge of the material with your presser-foot. Adjust the needle if need be. Know that a scant ¼” is better than a wide ¼”.
Now open up that pair, pretty sides facing you. Grab your third square and pin it facing square 2. Sew a ¼” seam just like you just did. Repeat for the rest of the row and the consecutive rows after -- but don't sew the rows together yet!

, This may seam tedious and unnecessary, but you'll be glad you did it later. And, yes, there’s a difference between pressing and ironing: pressing is a little more gentle. And if you sew some steam, things will turn out even crisper. Be sure to press your seams to one side – not open.


Press the seams one way for the even rows and press the seams the other for the odd rows. Continue to do that for each row that follows.
Once you have your two rows, match up the seams. Do the pressed seams directly touch? Great. Now pin the seams so the squares match up, too.

, Now that you have all the seams lined up, it'll be super easy to sew the rows. Follow the lines you have just created and get back to your machine.


If it's not perfect, don't fret. This is a skill that is required over time. But the patchwork-ness of your quilt should help disguise any imperfections.

"
"
Get four strips of fabric.,
Find your border length.,
Pin on the edges.,
Sew your border.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)4," This isn't necessarily a fabric you used in your actual quilt -- it could even be an opposing color to spice things up. Each strip should be the length of one side of the quilt and a few inches (at least 7.5 cm) wide.

, There are a variety of way to do this, but the simplest way is outlined below:


Carefully trim off the selvage edges (the part that comes on the edges of fabric to keep it from fraying) of the borders themselves. Then lay 2 of the border strips across the middle of your quilt, lining up one end of the strips with the edge of the quilt. The other strip edges will hang over the side.
Place a pin in the border strips where the quilt ends. And then carefully trim with your ruler and rotary cutter where that pin marks.

, Fold the border strip in half, end to end, to find the center. Pin the center of your strip to the center of the edge of your pieced quilt top and pin the ends of the strip to the ends of that quilt side.


Space pins along the strip to secure the strip in place. It is not bad if your strip is slightly smaller than the pieced part of the quilt (the other two strips are longer), but this is why starting at the center and the ends when pinning is important.

, Pin opposite side of quilt and sew both borders on to the edges of the pieced portion. Press the borders open and flat working from the front side of the quilt.


Repeat the process on the other edges. Lay the 2 remaining border strips across the center portion of the quilt. Place a pin to mark where to trim, cut off the remnants, pin and sew. Press once more.

"
"
Choose your batting.,
Cut out your backing.,
Assemble your layers.,
Keep them together.,
Start basting.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)5," This is the stuff that is sandwiched between the pretty parts of your quilt. There may seem like a billion options to choose from (and there are), making the process fairly intimidating. But sticking to the basics now will ensure your success later. Mainly, you need to consider the loft and fiber of your fabric.


Loft is a fancy term for how thick your batting is. A low loft means the batting is thin. A low-loft fabric is easier to work with, but will result in a thinner product.
Fiber is what material your batting is made of. Polyester, 100% cotton, and a cotton/poly blend are your three most common options and none is necessarily better than the others. Wool and silk are also available, but they're a bit pricier. And a recent mover on the scene is bamboo, but that's just strange.

Polyester - A cheap option that's better for hand-quilting if it's low-loft. It doesn't need to be quilted closely together, though it does tend to shift and the fibers can migrate to the edges of the quilt over time.
Cotton - This is a good option for machine quilting. It should be quilted closely. It will shrink a bit, but it shouldn't pill. The 100% kind feels like flannel.
Cotton blend (usually 80% cotton/20% polyester) - Probably the best option, if you had to pick. It's not super expensive and it doesn't shrink as much as the 100% kind. It's good on the machine, too.



, This should be the biggest part. The batting should be smaller than your quilt back and larger than your quilt top. The quilt top will be the smallest.


Just so long as it’s a few inches bigger on all sides than your front, you’re fine. The reason a back needs to be bigger is because you’re usually quilting from the top of the quilt and the batting and backing can shift slightly underneath. The extra inches are your insurance policy that your back doesn’t suddenly become smaller than the front.

, Basting a very important step in the quilting process. It seems tedious, but doing it carefully will result in a professional-looking finished project. Basting is a way to temporarily hold the three layers together while you quilt.


Iron the backing fabric and lay on the floor face down. Carefully pull the fabric taught (but don’t stretch it) and tape it to a hard, flat surface.
Smooth the batting and lay your quilt top over the batting. Press both layers together to get all wrinkles out. Doing so also helps the quilt top adhere slightly to the batting. When top and batting are smooth and flat, carefully roll the two together.
Bring the top and batting to the quilt back and carefully unroll on top of the backing, smoothing all wrinkles as you unroll. Make sure you can see backing fabric around all four edges of the quilt top.

, Here's where you have some options. That is, if you're machine quilting. You can always baste in the traditional sense or use spray baste, too.


Pin quilt top every few inches starting at the center. Use basting pins -- they're curved and easier to manipulate. When pins are in place, remove the tape and check the quilt back to make sure things are tight and flat.

If there are puckers or excess fabric, now is the time to fix the problems. If the fabric is loose when you start quilting, there will be tucks or puckers in the quilting. There is no way to adjust the back once you start sewing without a lot of headaches or time with the seam ripper. (However, using a busy, patterned fabric for the back will help to hide any small mistakes.)



, There are many options for machine quilting. The first is to let the seams/fabrics themselves be your guide. Sewing next to the seams themselves is called ""quilting in the ditch."" If you want to create more visual interest in the quilt you can stitch lines or patterns in other directions.


It’s a good idea to start quilting from the center and work your way out. Because it’s hard for all that bulk to fit through your machine, roll the sides in. You can un-roll as you work toward the edges. You may want to use a walking foot when quilting. It’s not necessary, but it helps feed the layers of fabric evenly through the machine.

Cut your fabric into 2 1/2"" (6.35 cm) squares.,
Mark a stitching line 1/4"" (0.6 cm) from each edge on the back of the squares.,
Sew together a red, white, and blue square.,
Make 2 more strips of 3 squares.,
Pin the first 2 strips (r/w/b and w/b/r) with their right sides together.,
Cut 1 1/2"" (.81 cm) strips of solid blue fabric in the same length as one block.,
Start stitching your border.,
Stitch the rows together.,
Place the fabric for the backing on the quilt top with the right sides together.,
Top the fabric layers with quilt batting.,
Start the finishing touches.",How to Make an American Quilt2," You will need to cut 9 squares of this size for each block that you make.


By no means limit yourself to three kinds of fabric! If you have 6 different variations of red and 8 different kinds of blue, use them all! This is a great time to use those scraps you've practically been hoarding.

, Vertically and horizontally. You can use tailor's chalk for the lines, but the marks won't show later, so a pencil works well, too.


This may seem tedious, but you'll get the hang of it and get into a rhythm. After you've done it 100 times, you'll be able to eyeball it with decent enough precision.

, In that order. Start by holding the red and white together, then add the blue when you've completed the first stitch.


If you find it awkward to hold the squares together, pin them first with quilter's pins.

, Only this time, put the colors in the following order: white, blue, red. You're developing a diagonal pattern to keep the colors from touching and repeating.


Your third strip should be in this order: blue, red, white. That's your block! That's the same block you'll be making throughout the entire quilt.

, Stitch across the marked seam lines to join the strips. Repeat by adding the third strip (b/r/w) to the strip beginning with white.


Continue making 9-patch blocks until you have enough to cover a sheet in the same size as your desired quilt. But don't sew them together! Complete all your blocks first. Lay the squares out, leaving a 1"" (2.5 cm) space between them.

, Again, one block should be 6 inches.


Since you know how many blocks you have, make all your strips now. They serve as a border and will be on all sides of each block.

, Stitch a blue strip to the left and right sides of one block, using a 1/4"" (.6 cm) seam allowance.


Stitch a second block to the strip on the right side of the first block. Continue adding strips and blocks until the combination is the desired width of your quilt. Be sure to end with a blue strip. This is your first row.
Continue making block rows until your have enough to reach the desired length and width of your American quilt.

, Again, use 1/4"" (0.6 cm) seam allowances, alternating with the long blue strips. Make sure to begin and end with a blue strip.

, A sheet makes for easy and quick backing.


It's very easy if you lay the quilt top on a large table or on the floor with the right side up. Whatever the surface, make sure it's cleared and clean.

, Pin the layers together, beginning in the center and smoothing the layers outward to keep them even.

, Sew around 3 sides, using a (you guessed it) 1/4"" seam allowance. Sew about halfway across the last side, leaving an opening for turning the quilt. Turn the quilt right side out, and iron the seams flat.


To keep the quilt together, bring a needle threaded with embroidery floss through all of the layers at the corner of every block, from the top to the bottom. Leave a 2-inch (5 cm) tail on the top. Make a small stitch and bring the needle back to the top.
Tie a double overhand knot in your exposed threads and cut the threads to the same length. Repeat at each corner of the 9-square blocks. After that, it's quilt-admiring time.

Prepare your fabric for cutting by pressing out all folds and wrinkles with spray sizing.,
Fold fabric salvage to salvage, allowing it to lay flat while keeping salvages mostly lined up.,
Fold folded edge to salvage edges making sure fabric lays flat and that fold is evenly matched to salvage edges.

,
Trim raw edge square to second fold of fabric.

,
Cutting 1 strip square to second fold of fabric and previously cut raw edge.,
Every few strips, you may have to re-trim and square raw edge and/or re-fold fabric.

",How to Cut Quilt Strips," Pressing is done with up and down of the iron rather than sliding side to side. The sizing will help stabilize the fabric from stretching.;
, If you have a long enough ruler and a steady hand at cutting, you can skip to trimming raw edges.

,,, Open it up to see if there are any ""W"" and waves in strip and correct before cutting the rest of the strips needed.

,"
"
Begin trimming and cutting.,
Sew the strips together to create one long strip.,
Pin your binding.,
Sew to your quilt.",How to Make a Quilt (for Beginners)6," You will need to trim the excess batting and backing fabric from your quilted project. Use a rotary cutter and your ruler to have a neat, square edge. Then start cutting your strips for the binding itself.


Trim the selvage off the strips. You'll need four that are the length of your edges, but smaller in width than your border. Around 2-3"" (5-7.5 cm) is an appropriate width, depending on the size of your quilt.

, This may seem confusing or counter-intuitive, but it's the easiest way to get going. Press the seams open and fold in half lengthwise. Press once more -- you want a firm crease on the edge of your quilt.

, Starting towards the center of one side (you don’t want you ends to join near a corner –- makes it a lot trickier), pin the raw edges of your pressed strip to the raw edges of the BACK side of the quilt.


When you get to the corner you are going to have to miter each one. To do this:

Fold the strip up at a 45 degree angle when you reach the corner of the quilt. Put a pin in at a 45 degree angle to hold that corner in place.
Fold the strip down to match the raw edges with the next side of the quilt. The fold should line up with the edge of the last side you were pinning to. You will have a little triangle that sticks up – place another pin at a 45 degree angle on the other side of the little triangle flap.


When the strip gets back around to the beginning, fold the ends down so that the strips meet-up. Press with your iron to make a crease at both folds. Trim strips to about ¼” (.6 cm) away from the fold. Pin together and sew seam right on the press marks of both strips. Press the seams open.

, You're almost there! Sew the binding to the back of the quilt with a ¼” seam allowance. (If you have a walking-foot feature on your machine, use it here.) When you get to the corner, stop your seam about ¼” away from the end of that side. Lift the presser foot and rotate the quilt in the new direction, putting the triangle flap the other direction start sewing from the beginning of that side.


When all four sides are sewn to the back of the quilt, fold the folded edge of the binding to the front of the quilt and pin in place. Mitered corners should fall into place. It’s like magic. Pin abundantly to keep the binding in place in preparation for machine sewing.
Using either a matching thread or an invisible thread (good if you don’t want your stitching showing as much on the back of the quilt), carefully stitch the binding down working from the front of the quilt. Carefully pivot the needle when you get to the corners and continue sewing all the way around the quilt. You may want to back-stitch at the start and finish.

"
Know the names used for quilt fabric textures, colours and designs.,
Choose plain, quality fabrics for large parts of the quilt.,
Choose solid fabrics when the print isn't important as part of the overall quilt design.,
Select prints according to the quilt design and pattern.,
For monochromatic quilting, choose some of the following:


Tone on tone prints: These are good for creating texture on the quilt and will tend to look plain when viewed from afar.,
Use reproduction fabrics if you're trying to make a vintage looking quilt.,
Add novelty prints for fun.,
Use blender fabrics when you want to match between different fabric types.,
Always put swatches of fabric color combinations together before proceeding to make your quilt.",How to Choose Quilt Fabrics," These are fairly much as follows:


Solid fabrics: This is one single colour, with no patterns.
Mini print fabrics: This is fabric with prints on a tiny scale. These are usually found in limited colours. They're ideal for beginners working with prints because they don't tend to show up mismatches in any obvious way.
Calico fabrics: This refers to small-scale prints, in a variety of colours.
Dot fabrics: This type of fabric has one design feature reprinted to appear like polka dots at even spaces. It might be dots, flowers, geometric shapes, etc.
Airy fabrics: This refers to fabrics with subtle line designs and very few colours in the same fabric.
Large scale fabrics: This fabric has large prints/designs across all of the fabric. It's not always ideal for small pieces on a quilt as the design can be chopped off too much to be able to know what it is.
Stripe fabrics: Any fabric containing small to large stripes. They can lead the eye in one direction and can give a sense of the quilt having been pieced.
Geometric fabrics: Straight lines across fabric in geometric patterns.
Tone on tone fabrics: This is a print in one colour in varying gradations of the colour.
Directional fabrics: This is fabric that features a design all headed in the same direction. Generally not recommended for beginners because if this design gets skewed, it can look terrible.;
, Homespun fabrics are a good solid choice that consist of plain dyed and pure cotton. They range in quality, so take care when selecting. The colour range is enormous. If you purchase high quality homespun fabrics, be sure to check that it has been pre-shrunk and mercerized before use. Checking for colourfastness is also important.

, However, be careful if you're a beginner––solid fabric piecing and sewing must be good or errors show up easily. For the beginner, look for prints that hide imperfections easily.

,


Choose large prints when you want to make a feature part of the quilt. Large prints will also work well for borders.
Choose small prints when you want to add them to small pieced blocks. Small prints can work as binding, backing and sashing.
Choose stripes and checks when you want to create a really spiced up block or a narrow border or sashing. They also make fetching binding.

, If you're making a monochromatic quilt, this is a good choice.
Black and white prints: This is a very interesting quilting combination that could be used for a bold statement quilt, a quilt that mimics zebra stripes, or a more subtle black and white pattern for a vintage look.

, These have a retro look and can be from eras as far back as the 1700s through to ones that pick up on prints from the 1920s and 1930s, which used to be called ""feedsacks"", and include patterns up to the 1950s. These prints range from dainty ones with small floral patterns, depictions of people and animals, to more bold geometric shapes and bright colors. During the Depression era, fabric chemists perfected pastels, so fabric harkening back to this era will often have a pastel color quality. Some also feature prints of old products such as biscuits (cookies), tea and chocolate but these can also be viewed as novelty prints.

, When you want to add a fun and cute element to a quilt or you're making a themed quilt, the novelty prints are ideal. They'll often reflect current trends and have images of teacups and teapots, cupcakes, animals, plants, sports, etc. They make great backing but can be fussy to cut.

, Blender fabrics work to bridge or harmonize between different colors or patterns and serve to unify the quilt as a whole.

, While you may think that the colors go well together when purchasing them separately or matching them in your mind's eye, it isn't until you place them down side by side that you'll really know whether they're a good match or not.


You'll often find a few colours stand out more than others. Is this the look you want to achieve overall?

Use a fabric pen.,
Use embroidery.,
Make a label.,
Sew your name in small beads.",How to Label a Quilt," Write your name in a corner with neat writing. This option is the least pretty and you risk the ink running or your writing not looking neat enough.;
, Embroidering your name on is in keeping with the stitchery feel of the project and will last as long as the quilt. Use an embroidery stitch that you're good at and that will stand out from the rest of the quilt. Again, choose a corner or some other inconspicuous place.

, If you want to make a label, this can be sewn directly to the quilt. The advantage of a label is that it can be written on without marring the quilt. It can also be large enough to include your address or a phone number as well as your name if wished. The label could be in matching fabric, or use calico or other similar easy-to-sew fabric with an old world feel.

, This can be a pretty option albeit a fiddly one.

Choose a binding fabric.,
Take measurements.,
Cut the binding fabric into strips of your chosen width.,
Sew the pieces together using the following method until you have a binding strip long enough to outline the perimeter of your quilt:









Lay two strips at a right angle with the ends overlapping, so that they form an inverted “L” shape.,
Prepare the quilt for binding.,
Begin sewing the binding.,
Bind the first corner.,
Sew all the edges and corners.,
Finish sewing the first side.,
Turn the quilt over and bind the other side.",How to Bind a Quilt," Your quilt’s binding can be designed to make a bold statement or blend in with the pattern. Envision the way you want your finished quilt to look as you make your fabric choice.









Fabric with a crosswise grain, as opposed to a lengthwise grain, is a sturdier choice for binding. Because of the direction of the grain, a split in one area won’t run along the entire length of the binding. Instead, it will run crosswise and end at the seam where the binding joins the quilt.
Bias binding strips, with a grain that runs diagonally, are also good for sturdy binding. Again, a split in the fabric won’t travel as far since the grain doesn’t run the length of the fabric.;
, The amount of fabric you’ll need to buy is determined by how large your quilt is and how much you want the binding to stand out.









Choose the width of your binding. If your quilt already has a built-in border, you may want thinner binding. If you’d like the binding to act as a border, you may want it to be wide. Keep in mind you’ll be cutting the fabric into strips that will then be folded in half.
Measure the four sides of your quilt to determine the length of its perimeter. You’ll need twelve to fifteen extra inches of binding material.

, You may find a rotary cutter to be helpful for larger projects. Fabric scissors will also do the trick.








, Pin the strips at the outer corner using a straight pin.
Stitch a diagonal line across where the two strips meet. Pull the top strip down so the two strips form a straight line. Trim away the extra fabric triangle on the outside of the seam, leaving ¼” seam allowance.
Continue attaching more strips in this fashion until you have one long strip.
When your binding strip is long enough, iron it straight and flat. Fold it in half lengthwise and iron it again to create a crease down the middle of the fabric.

, After you have finished quilting, use your sewing machine to stitch in a straight line 1/8” from from the edge of the quilt around its entire perimeter. This will ensure that the layers of the quilt stay flat and in place during the binding process.









When you’re finished stitching, trim any rough edges or excess batting from the perimeter of the quilt to make sure it is neat and even.

, Line up the raw edges of the binding strip with the raw edge of the quilt. The folded part of the binding strip should be on the inside of the quilt top. Begin sewing about three inches from the corner, leaving an unsewn “tail” that will be tucked into the binding later.









Choose the seam allowance that fits the look of your quilt. The most common seam allowance is ¼”.
Use the walking foot on your sewing machine to prevent the fabric from bunching up.
Sew along the first side of the quilt until you’ve reached the same distance from the corner as your seam allowance. If you’re using a ¼” seam allowance, stop stitching ¼” from the corner.
Backstitch a few centimeters and cut the threads.

, Begin by folding the long tail of the binding up, so that it runs parallel to the next side of the quilt you’re going to bind. The lower edge of the strip will form a 45-degree angle. Keeping that folded angle in place, fold the tail down so that its raw edge is aligned with the raw edge of the next side of the quilt. This is called mitering a corner. Begin sewing a new line at a right angle to where the first stitch ended. Backstitch over the corner to make sure it stays firmly in place.








, Continue sewing the binding along the edge of the quilt, using the same seam allowance you used on the previous edge. As you approach each corner, stop stitching the same distance from the edge as your seam allowance. Miter the corner and continue sewing along the last edge.








, When you reach the place where you began binding the quilt, trim the tail, leaving just enough fabric to overlap the starting place by about four inches. Fold the fabric under at a diagonal and tuck the other tail at the beginning of the binding underneath. Continue stitching along the edge of the quilt and sew over your original seam by an inch or so. Backstitch and trim your thread.








, Flip the quilt and fold the binding strip to the same measurement as your seam allowance. If you used a ¼” seam allowance, fold the binding strip over the edge ¼”. Use your walking foot to begin stitching along the edge of the quilt.









Guide your quilt carefully and stitch slowly. Adjust the quilt as needed to ensure your seam is straight.
When you reach the corner, miter it. Fold the end of the binding strip under at a 45-degree angle at the corner, then laying it flat along the next edge. Carefully pivot the quilt in the sewing machine at the corner and continue stitching the next edge of the quilt. Sew each edge and corner of the quilt in this manner.
Continue stitching about an inch over the place where you started. Backstitch, then trim the thread.

Make smaller projects.",How to Keep Quilting Costs Low," Patchwork quilting in America was born from a time when (mostly) women could not simply go to the store to buy new bedding, and fabric yardage was reserved mainly for making new clothing. Thrifty sewers learned to re-use old shirts, curtains, sheets, and even flour sacks to produce warm, beautiful, and practical quilts. Often, a woman had to make do with what she had, rather than be able to run to the store for a yard of fabric. So, a couple of quilt patterns developed that produced great results which do not demand a set amount of fabric:


Beggar's or Friendship Quilt: this quilt is typically made of simply of squares, none of which are identical. Traditionally, the quilter asks people to donate a piece of fabric or old item of clothing. Of course, nothing says you have to strictly follow these rules. Feel free to use triangles and use two or three pieces of the same fabric if you like.
Grandmother's Flower Garden: this pattern uses honeycomb shapes to make flower shapes, and uses (traditionally) a white ""background"" to create the ""path"". The flower shapes lend themselves very easily to use a lot of small pieces in many different colors, making it easy to reuse scraps, reclaimed fabric, and the like.
Crazy Quilt: Crazy quilts allows the quilter to ignore all the typical rules about using geometric shapes in a pattern. This also allows for re-using irregular remnants, scraps, and cut-up old clothing.;
, Ideally, this would come from some face-to-face contact with someone with quilting experience. Quilters are usually quite happy to share their knowledge. If you do not have a family member, friend, or acquaintance that can help, check for local quilter's clubs, guilds, or organizations--check your local fabric shop for information or contacts. Check the Internet on sites like Craigslist, too.

, A simple Google search can list plenty of tutorials, including YouTube videos, and forums.

, This includes not only materials, but resources. Of course you can buy all new fabric, buy a new sewing machine, and fancy quilting software to plan it all out. However, you can significantly slash your costs if you consider free options.


Quilters are often quite willing to share. This often means their expertise and tools, even (if you are lucky) their fabric stash. If your aunt, grandmother, friend, or other quilter is willing to get you started on your first quilt, she may very well be happy to let you borrow her sewing set-up. If you discover you enjoy sewing and quilting, you can work towards building your set-up, but you don't have to invest in everything if you have access to it.
Quilting can quickly become expensive, because it is not only the fabric, but the machinery, tools, and things you may not think about now, such as notions like thread, batting, and binding and good-quality sewing scissors.
Borrow a machine. If you're making your first quilt but you don't already own a machine, consider borrowing one from someone you know who has one that they don't use. Borrowing a sewing machine has the added advantage of giving you a chance to figure out which features you would like your own machine when you go to buy one. It can also be useful should you decide the hobby just isn't for you, you won't have outlaid too much money!
Inexpensive racks are available that allow you to do some quilting on a standard sewing machine. You might even be able to pick one up from an online auction for even less.
Consider doing some of your quilting by hand, like they did in the old days. While it may go slower than with a machine, you will still get there. Plus, you may get ""bonus points"" for doing it the old-school way!
Quilting frames can be expensive; consider borrowing one, or look around online for do-it-yourself quilting frames that you can construct inexpensively out of PVC.
Batting options: You can buy batting, but it can end up being the most expensive part of the quilt! Luckily, you have options. A light summer quilt may not even really need batting. You can also substitute an old blanket or one or more old sheets for batting; what a great way to reuse old ugly bedding!

, Become part of a mailing list to receive coupons that will give regular discounts on fabric. These coupons can be used to purchase the more expensive tools that you might want but would rather buy at a reduced price. With coupons, you don't have to wait for your wanted item to go on sale. Also, if you're on a mailing list, you'll usually be notified of any special store sale events just for members and of all upcoming sales.

, Big box stores and quilt shops constantly run sales on their wares to encourage more purchases. Fabric might be on clearance by 30 to 50 percent off, especially if you find it just after a holiday period. And look for 2 for one or freebie deals – the rotary cutter you covet might be free if you buy a particular ruler, for example. Shop around and be aware of what's out there, and what might be offered in the near future. Fellow quilters always seem to have their ear to the ground on this front and can help give you a heads up.


Look for sales in craft departments, not only for fabric, but also for fabric and tools.
Check bedding and linen departments for blankets, sheets, pillowcases, curtains, and so on which can all be cut and used in quilting. Often, a flat sheet may be wider and less expensive than the cut by the yard fabric. Plus, wider fabric makes excellent quilt backings.
Go to garage sales and estate sales. You can find some of the most wonderful fabric and quilter's notions at simple estate sales. Estate sales are like garage sales on steroids, and the prices are generally similar. You may see some amazing vintage quilts that people are just itching to get rid of. The holy grail of garage sales, of course, is one that your quilting buddy is having.
Garage sales and estate sales are one place to find a starter sewing machine. Or, visit local auctions where estate goods have been added to the auction lots. Charity stores are another inexpensive source both for sewing machines and some tools. The sewing machine may not have all the bells and whistles of the latest model, but you can do a lot of sewing even on a very old machine. The basic technology really hasn't changed, and many old machines are nearly indestructible.
Most every old or second-hand machine will likely need an overhaul, deep cleaning, and tinkering for it to run reliably and well. While you can learn how to do it yourself, typically it is best to find a good sewing machine technician and let him or her do it. The investment may seem a bit much at first, it is an investment that avoids frustration and even damaged items in the long run.

, When you stumble across that estate sale, you might not buy that batting you found if you don't have it on the list. Or you might buy one too small. Or buy two you don't need at all.

, Provided you have a bit of space to store it, accumulate a selection of fabrics you can use in any project you want. This is ideal for sales purchases which were such a bargain but you're not sure what to do with just yet.


Don't go overboard. Quilters are infamous for their ""fabric stashes"" that they have squirreled away for years, even decades. Even if they may not be currently making a quilt they still may be very reluctant to part with any of it. Try to limit your ""stash"" to a manageable size (such as ONE tote), use what you have before buying more, and do not buy without draining your stash.

, Make wall hangings, vests, or bags rather than giant bed quilts,especially as you begin. They're easier to manage and they require less fabric. Smaller projects can also help to use up odds and ends.

Not only does having a good cutting tool make the product more professional looking, it also speeds up the process of making a quilt and adds ease for beginners. Regular sewing scissors can be used, but rotary cutters are typically considered the easiest and fastest of the cutting tools.


Rotary cutters come in a variety of of sizes, but a medium size is the best to start with.
If you choose to use regular scissors, be sure that they are well sharpened and will not snag the fabric.;
, Cutting your fabric on a regular tabletop may seem the easiest, but you are likely to score your furniture and you will not be able to get as straight of a line. Get a self-healing cutting mat to cut against to prevent this. These come with a printed ruler on the topside, making lining up your fabric and getting the perfect edges easy.

, Not just any ruler, an extra long and wide ruler will work best for quilting. Find a ruler that is 5x24 inches and made of a transparent plastic. This ruler will allow you to sandwich your fabric between your cutting board and the ruler to make perfect cuts every time. If you are working on a small quilt, a 5x12 inch ruler is a fine tool to use too.

, These are the things that are useful for any sewing project, including straight pins, safety pins, and a seam ripper. If you don’t have them already, they are available at craft and sewing supply stores. You will need many straight and safety pins for sewing a quilt, so stock up on these in particular.

, Thread seems universal, but is available in many different materials and colors. Avoid using a cheap thread as it is more likely to break when sewing and give off lint when washed. Higher quality cotton thread is the best option for a quilt. If you want to use your thread for multiple projects, buy a spool of a neutral color like white, tan, or gray.

, The most important step in making a quilt is preparing the fabric. With thousands of fabrics available on the market, this task can seem a bit daunting. A basic quilt can most easily be made of 100% cotton fabric, although polyester and polyester/cotton blends are also options. Choose several different fabrics for the front of the quilt, the border, as well as 1-2 primary fabrics for the quilt backing.


Consider the colors and scale you are using. How many different colors do you want to incorporate? How many different patterns? Try to get a good mix of large and small patterns as well as colors from the same family.
Get creative with your fabric options. Look for vintage tablecloths or sheets at thrift stores rather than relying solely on the fabric options at your local sewing store.
Your backing fabric will be larger than both the front of your quilt and the batting, so make sure that you get enough to allow for a bigger size.

, Batting, also called filling or wadding, is the fluffy material that adds warmth to your quilt. It is sandwiched between the front of your quilt and the backing. Batting comes in several different fibers, including cotton, polyester, cotton blend, bamboo, and fusible. It is sold in different “lofts” or thicknesses; a smaller loft is thinner, while a higher loft is thicker.


Polyester batting is more likely to spread out towards the edges of your quilt over time and fusible batting has high chances of puckering. Therefore, beginners should look into the cotton, cotton blend, or bamboo batting options first.
If you’re making a large quilt, such as a comforter for a bed, using a higher loft may be preferred. Smaller quilts may not require such thick batting, unless you want an extra warm blanket., Although you can hand-stitch a quilt, the process is much more time-intensive and a bit more daunting for beginner quilters. Use a sewing machine for the easiest quilt; any machine that can make a straight line will do fine! Be sure to have plenty of spare needles to keep your machine running smoothly.

, It will be necessary to press your quilt at several points in the process, so get an iron (preferably with steaming abilities) to use for this. Don’t worry about using a fancy or expensive iron - a trip to your local thrift store may be all you need., Although you don’t need a pattern to make a quilt, it is sometimes helpful to have a basic pattern to work with. Free quilt patterns are available online, or you can purchase a book of patterns from a sewing shop. If you would rather design your own pattern based on your own measurements, a bit of graphing paper and a pencil is all you need.


Even if you do not purchase or make a pattern, drawing a rough sketch of your design before starting is highly recommended.
The easiest quilt for beginners is a blanket made of rows of quilted squares. Using larger pieces for each square will be easier than many small pieces.

, Although not everyone chooses to do this, prewashing your fabric will shrink it and rinse out any extra dye - things that might ruin your quilt after finishing if not done earlier. Higher quality fabrics will not lose dye or shrink so much, but it is best to wash your fabric regardless of the quality. This will also remove any dirt or grime that made its way onto the fabric.

, To remove any wrinkles and make cutting easier, press your fabric with an iron. Use the steam setting if you have it available. You needn’t iron the batting - only the fabric for the front and the back of the quilt will need it.

, If you know how large you want your quilt to be, you need to measure the size of each of the individual pieces to fit. The trickiest part of measuring is remembering the seam allowance; each side of the fabric will be sewn to another side of fabric using a ¼-inch seam allowance. This means that you must add ¼ inch to the sides of each piece. For example, if you want your quilt to be made of 4-inch squares, you will need to measure and cut each square to be 4½ x 4½ inches. The extra ½ inch will be sewn as the seam allowance.


The size of your quilt and each piece is rather arbitrary unless you are using a specific pattern. Therefore, make your pieces as large or small as you like based on your skill level.
If it helps, you can use a washable fabric pen to mark your measurements on your fabric prior to cutting.

, Focus on the front of the quilt for now; cut out each of the small pieces of fabric that you will be quilting together. Lay each piece on your cutting board and place your clear ruler over the top. Use your rotary blade to run across the fabric along the exact lines on the cutting mat. Follow the old saying of “measure twice, cut once,” to make sure that you don’t accidentally make a mistake in cutting.








, This part of the process is enjoyable - now you get to design your quilt! Lay out all the little pieces you have just cut into the pattern you think you want. It’s easiest to do this on the floor where you have plenty of space to work with. Make sure that you have your pattern exactly how you want it, even if you rearrange the whole thing several times.









You may find that you want to add additional fabric pieces in a different color or pattern at this point. Simply substitute out some of your pre-cut squares for new ones in different prints.
Keep track of the rows of fabric by using post-it notes or chalk to mark each piece.

, It is a little inconvenient to have a giant quilt pattern laid out on your floor, so stack up the pieces in order. Work from left to right across the rows, stacking each piece on top of the one before it. Then, you can mark the top of each row with a post-it note to know what order it should go in.

, Begin your quilt by sewing each individual row of pieces together. Work by starting at one end of your row with two of your squares of fabric. Place the two squares with the pattern facing each other. Then, use a straight stitch on your sewing machine to sew a ¼-inch seam. Then, add the next square in the row to the one before it, using the same process. Work across each row so they are all sewn together in long, thin strips.









Pin each square to the one it is being sewn to before sewing to help keep them in line.
Getting a consistent seam on all your pieces is vital to having your pattern line up in the finished quilt. Make sure that you are sewing at exactly ¼ inch for each piece of fabric.

, With each of the pieces sewn together, the back will be left with columns of seams that stick up. To make your final quilt lay flat and look more finished, press these seams flat with your iron. Iron each row in the opposite direction; iron all the seams in the first row to the right, in the second row to the left, in the third row to the right, et cetera.

, Use the same process as you did for sewing each small square of fabric together to sew each row of fabric together. Take two adjacent rows and turn them inwards so the patterns are facing each other. Sew along the bottom using a ¼-inch seam. Repeat this process for each additional row, until you have a complete quilt front.









If the rows and pieces do not line up, do not worry! Your quilt will still look lovely even with some minor mistakes.

, Flip your quilt front over so the backside is exposed. Use the same technique for ironing each individual row for ironing the entire back of the quilt. Flatten out the seams in opposite directions - the first row left, second row right, third row left, et cetera. Doing a quality job on pressing the fabric will make sewing the whole thing together much easier., With the top of your quilt finished, the batting and backing need to be cut as well. These should be slightly larger than your quilt front, to allow for any scrunching the fabric may do during the sewing process. Measure and cut both the batting and backing to be 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) larger than the front piece of your quilt.








, Basting is the process of layering your quilt and pinning it in place before sewing. There are two options for basting - using safety pins to hold the pieces in place, or using a spray-on basting adhesive. Lay your fabrics in the order they will appear on your quilt - the backing pattern side down, then the batting, then the quilt front pattern side up. Line up all the sides and smooth out any wrinkles. Work out the wrinkles starting from the center and going in an outwards direction.









If you use a basting spray, lightly mist each layer before adding the next one on top of it. Smooth out the fabric after the spray has secured the layers in place.
If you are pinning your quilt together, use safety pins in the center of each piece. Work from the center outwards as you pin.
If you want to be extra cautious, you can use both basting techniques by spraying and pinning your quilt in place. Doing this will make sure that your quilt is extra secure before sewing., Start in the center of your quilt and sew outwards to push excess fabric and bunching towards the edges rather than the middle. The easiest way of sewing the layers of the quilt together is to “stitch the ditch,” or sew inside or near the seams you have already created between pieces. You can also choose to sew diagonally across pieces or free hand the seams on your sewing machine.








If you want to make sure you are sewing in the right place, use a washable sewing pen to mark the exact locations on your quilt that you want to sew.
The more seams you sew through the entire quilt, the better the finished product will be. Adding more seams will prevent the batting from moving around or bunching inside the quilt.
You can add a border seam around the edge of your quilt once you have sewn together the entire center of your blanket.

, The binding is a border of fabric that goes around the edge of your quilt to protect the seams and add a more finished look. You can choose to cut your binding horizontally/vertically or on the bias, with the latter allowing for more flexibility. Cut your strips (you will have to overlap some most likely) to be 2½ inches wide and long enough to go around the entire perimeter of your quilt. Sew together the strips so you have 4 pieces equal to the lengths of the 4 sides of your quilt.

, If you had to sew together multiple pieces of fabric to create a single length for the binding, press the seams flat at this point. Then, fold the binding in half lengthwise and iron the fabric. This will leave you with a pressed seam running down the middle of the entire binding.

, Lay the binding for two opposite sides down on the top of your quilt. Set the binding so the edges line up, and the patterns are face to face (the back of the binding will be facing you). Use plenty of pins to secure the fabric in place like this.

, Go along the edge of the quilt and the binding and sew using a ½-inch seam. This should be done on both of the sides of fabric, leaving you with a quilt with two pieces of backwards binding sewn in place. Then, fold the fabric up and away from the center of the quilt, exposing the printed side of the binding.

, Place the other two strips of binding along the open sides of the quilt. Use the same process as the original two sides, sewing the binding along the edge with a ½-inch seam allowance. Then, fold the fabric outwards and away from the center of the quilt, exposing the pattern.

, Flip your quilt over so the back of it is exposed. The edges of your binding should be sticking up all the way around your quilt. Start on one side by folding the edge of the binding to meet the edge of the quilt. Then, fold the rest of the binding over so that it overlaps with the back of the quilt. You can iron the binding down to help keep in place, and then add plenty of pins to secure it. Do this with all the sides of your quilt.

, Sewing the binding on the backside is tricky, because the stitches will show through on the front. Therefore, you have two options to minimize the amount of thread that will be seen: use an invisible thread to sew the binding, or hand stitch it with a whipstitch or a ladder stitch, making sure to avoid going through all three layers of your quilt. Work your way around the edges of the quilt, making sure that your corners are squared off and your seams are even., With the addition of the binding, your quilt has been finished! Wash your quilt again if you like to give it a soft, vintage-y feel. Otherwise, your quilt is ready to go. Enjoy!

Choose a simple block shape to sew.,

You'll need two sizes of squares, one an inch (2.5cm) bigger all around than the other.,
Center a batting square on the ""wrong"" side of your larger backing square.,

Sew the seam.,

Press the seam open and place the next block piece in the same manner, lining up the edges, sewing the seam, pressing open, until you reach the edges of the block.,



Turn the inch (2.5cm) wide, unquilted border section of the block sandwich under the block out of the way.,
Repeat for all four sides.,Sew rows of blocks together in this manner.,
Sew the rows together, stitching the flap edges together, and then pressing them open and top stitching the entire row.,

Roll the outside edges over and top stitch to finish the edge.",How to Quilt With a Regular Sewing Machine," Diagonals work well, as do crazy quilt designs. Keep in mind that you'll be limited to straight sewn lines in your designs (as you would have in a foundation pieced block).
, The beauty of this is that you can do all of your cutting with a rotary cutter using your regular cutting rulers if you like. The large squares will be used for the backing fabric. The small squares will be used for your batting and top pieces. The squares used in this example were 7 inches (17.78cm) and 5 inches (12.7cm) square respectively, making the larger square two inches (5cm) longer per side., You're now ready to place the first block pieces on the top.





 Starting with your first piece

Place the first block piece on the batting, face up. If you want adjacent blocks to line up exactly, make a cardboard ""starting point"" template to line up your first block with.




 Putting the two blocks together

Place the second block piece face down with the seam edges lined up with the first piece.

, Sew it through both block pieces, through the batting, and through the backing, like a giant sandwich., Stop each seam at the edge of the batting.


Note: If you're using a poly batting, take care to press with a cool iron, as a hot iron will compress a poly batting. Cotton batting is best for this project.

, Trim any fabric which protrudes past the batting edge. If you're careful, this can be done with your rotary cutter and a ruler as well., You have made one block. Create the rest, and then start to join them together as follows:

Place two blocks backing side to backing side, with edges lined up. Feel carefully to ensure that the batting edges line up.
Sew a seam down the inch (2.5cm) wide flap(s) just barely outside of the batting. Take care not to catch the batting into the seam, as this will make the finished seam bunch up.






Press the seam open from both sides.












From the front side, fold or roll the inch flaps under themselves and pin in place.






Top stitch both of the folded edges down.

,, The maximum length of fabric under the neck of your machine at any time will be 10-12 inches (25.4cm to 30.48cm); this is very manageable for a ""regular"" machine.,







The back of the blocks will already be quilted. No need to go through the whole quilt frame and long arm rigmarole!

Select quality rotary cutting supplies.,
Get a decent steam iron.,
Find a good seam ripper.,
Invest in spring loaded scissors and shears.,
Have a ¼ inch foot.",How to Buy the Right Quilting Tools," This includes a rotary cutter, acrylic rulers, and a cutting mat. These tools are made for precise cutting. Quilter's worldwide wouldn't think of starting a quilting project without them. You’ll find that the more accurately you cut your quilt pieces, the more accurately your quilt top is sewn together. Olfa is an excellent brand, and is the leader in the quilting community.;
, You can't start a quilting project without one. Now, you can buy the really expensive Rowenta professional iron, or, you can go to Walmart or Target and buy their $20 steam iron. Both will get the job done. They both last about the same amount of time, will both do a decent job, but one is a lot less expensive to replace. It is highly recommended to use spring water in your irons—tap water can lead to hard water stains on your quilt top, and most manufactures say that you shouldn’t use distilled water.

, Most quilters have two or three of them on hand at any given time. Dritz makes a variety of excellent seam rippers. You’ll find they have everything from seam rippers with magnifying glasses to ergonomic seam rippers for those of us quilters who rip out stitches on a regular basis.

, These scissors and shears are spring loaded to prevent hand fatigue while cutting repetitively. Quilting, and sewing for that matter, involves a lot of cutting. blunt tipped work really well for cutting threads, and a pair of sharp tip, which are good to use for cutting appliqué pieces. Most quilters own these. Fiskars, in this instance, is my brand of choice.

, A quarter inch foot for your sewing machine will get you going toward an accurate ¼ inch seam allowance. Almost all quilt patterns instruct you to use an accurate quarter inch. Many sewing machines come with these feet. However, if you bought a simple hobby machine, you’ll most likely need to purchase one. There are so many brands for different types of machines that you’ll want to check with your local machine dealership to buy the right one. Don’t worry, they aren’t expensive, but they’re definitely necessary. You may even find them at your local quilt shop.

Inspect the quilt.,
Select an appropriate detergent.,
Use cold water and a short, gentle cycle.,
Add vinegar to the wash, if desired.",How to Clean a Quilt1," Look for a care tag with guidelines for washing and drying. If there is one, follow the instructions provided. Check the quilt for embellishments, appliques, and loose seams or lace. See if there are any highly saturated or contrasting colors, hand dying, or batiks.Quilts with embellishments shouldn’t be washed in a washing machine. Loose seams should be repaired before washing the quilt.Quilts with vivid colors may bleed. Test the fabric with white cotton fabric dipped in hot water. Rub the quilt’s highly saturated area and see if any color comes off. If so, use a color catcher product in the washing machine.;
, Choose a liquid-based detergent that is colorless and unscented, without any fabric softener, brighteners, or bleach.You can purchase special laundry soap specifically for quilts, if desired. Alternately, use baby shampoo instead of laundry detergent.For example, castile soap is safe to use on quilts.

, Alternately, if your quilt is delicate or not cotton-based, you can hand wash it in a large tub. Let the detergent completely dissolve, then stir the quilt gently in the water.Never use hot water to wash a handmade quilt. Don’t use the normal wash and spin cycles of your washing machine.If your quilt is yellowed or has an odor such as smoke, soak it overnight first in cold water.You may want to wash the quilt in cold water a second time, without any detergent, to ensure that no detergent residue remains on the fabric., Pour half a cup (125 mL) of distilled white vinegar into your wash cycle.

Transfer the wet quilt carefully to its drying location.,
Tumble dry on low with clothing, if desired.,
Air out the quilt outdoors.,
Air-dry the quilt indoors.",How to Clean a Quilt2," Support the weight of the wet quilt as you transport it. Hold it like a baby, and don’t pull on any one section of the fabric.If the weight isn’t properly supported, threads in the quilt may pop., This works for new, well-made, quality fabric quilts.You can dry the quilt completely. Alternately, dry it partially and then lay it flat on a rack or outside to dry.Don’t iron your quilt, or put it in direct sunlight.

, You can air out your quilt outside to dry it, if it’s dusty, or if it has an odor. Find an area in the shade, since direct sunlight can fade fabric. Hang it on a balcony or clothesline, or spread it out on the ground. If you spread it on the ground, place a bedsheet underneath it and another on top of it. Weigh the corners down.You can also air dry a quilt on a balcony by laying down a mattress pad and spreading the quilt out on top of it. If birds are a concern, spread another mattress pad on top. Turn the quilt over when the top is nearly dry., If the weather isn’t appropriate for outdoor drying, line dry the quilt by placing it flat on a rack. Alternately, place a few mattress pads on a bed (at least one of them should be waterproof). Set up a fan to blow horizontally towards the quilt for about a day."

Wash your quilt only when necessary.,
Freshen the scent of your quilt without washing it.,
Spot clean your quilt, as needed.,
Use a lint roller or vacuum, as needed.,
Store your quilt in a fabric bag in a dark, dry location.",How to Clean a Quilt3," Washing your quilt only when it’s soiled will extend its life. Wash your quilt once per year, even if you use it daily. In between washings, air it outside on a drying rack.If your quilt is a decorative accent that is hardly used, opt for airing it out a few times a year instead of cleaning it.You may need to wash the quilt more often than annually if it’s used by children, pets, or if someone in the home has allergies.

, Try placing the quilt in a sealed bag with a bar of soap for a day or two. Alternately, you can try using a fabric freshener product; just make sure to spot test a small, inconspicuous area first for color-fastness., You can treat stains by gently dabbing them with white vinegar or a quilt soap, diluted with distilled water.Make sure to blot and not rub the stain. Put a white cloth below the quilt, then flush the area with cold water.Don’t use any soap or detergent that contains bleach.
If the markings are lines from the quilting process, you can brush off white lines or dab them with a damp cloth. Gray lines are usually pencil and you can remove them gently with a gum eraser., Rub a lint roller across the whole front and back of the quilt. This will remove lint, pet hair, thread tails and loose threads.If your quilt isn’t very delicate, you can vacuum it on the lowest setting, using a brush attachment covered with pantyhose., If your quilt is not in use, place it in a cotton or muslin bag. Make sure the quilt is clean before storing it. Remove and refold it monthly. Air out your quilt when you take it out of storage, outside or in a drier (on the low, tumble setting).For example, try storing your quilt in a cotton pillowcase.

Get everything ready:


Clean the machine and make sure it is kept at room temperature.,
Think about the look you are trying to achieve.,
Use a walking foot, if available.,
Loosen the top tension – you do not want the bobbin thread to show.,
Drop the feed dogs or cover with masking tape if necessary.

,
Use a darning foot or no foot.,
Place your work in an embroidery hoop and set drum tight, tighten the screw with the flat section of the hoop against the machine bed, or hold tightly in your hands.,
Use the needle as a pencil.,
Have some scrap paper and a pencil beside you and work the ideas on paper first – you’re trying to get the brain to use the needle as a pencil!,
Look for PATTERNS that occur in nature – animal markings, wood grain, marble, water reflections etc!,
As you become more confident, work without a grid and try to work continuous patterns.,
On ‘whole cloth’ quilting, try voiding shapes as well as filling shapes.,
On patchwork, think about filling different areas or imposing an all over pattern.

,
Use a printed fabric for backing and stitch the outlines of the pattern from the back and then quilt in the areas from the front – this works well with large scale furnishing fabrics.

,
Use a free zigzag stitch to create fill patterns.

",How to Machine Quilt," If it has been stored in a cool room, the oil can get thick so leave in a warm area for a few hours.
Check the needles you are using. A quilting needle is sharper than a universal needle and makes a smaller point. For metallic threads use a metallic or embroidery needle. Use a fine cotton thread 30 or 40 with a size 70 needle.
Loosen the top tension if any bottom thread shows. Always work a sample.
Fix the layers with safety pins or machine stitch rows with dissolving (soluble) thread. If you hand tack, the thread can get caught on the machine foot and drag your stitching.
Use a walking foot for machine fed quilting if you have one.;
, Quilting by machine has a different look to hand quilting, making the fabric harder and flatter. Thinner cotton wads make machine quilting easier and are available in many weights and fabrics, e.g. polyester, cotton, wool or silk. Experiment with samples of as many as you can find. Quilting supply stores, craft stores and online sources, like The Cotton Patch, sell sample packs of wadding; all cotton, polyester and mixed.

, Start in the middle of your work and work all the lines to the right. Then turn the piece over and work all the lines to the left of the center.


Do not go up and down as this can cause diagonal drags to appear. Think about how you start and stop. One possibility is to start with the stitch length set to 0 and then increasing it over the first 1⁄2 in. to normal length.
Alternatively, sew a few stitches on the spot – this can cause a bump of thread if you are not careful – or pull the threads to the back and tie in a knot before threading away into the backing with a needle. Beware this can take hours on a big quilt.
Stitch in the ditch, seams must be pressed to one side, only machine pieced work.
Stitch away from the seam 1⁄4 in. – think about colour choice. Some people work a slight curve from corner to corner or point to point, try them and see.
Straight line grids – use masking tape to make even lines to follow.
Curved lines but still machine fed.
Use a twin needle.
Use different threads. Try threads (splits) of threads, monofilament thread, variegated thread or shiny rayon thread. Note which snaps or frays the most. Coloured threads can be used to add interest to a large plain area of a block.
Machine set patterns – if you have a newer machine try some of the pattern stitches. Check the look on the back as you go.
Work a narrow zigzag stitch or satin stitch,
Use satin stitch to work small ties for tied quilting or use a preset pattern such as heart or snowflake.
Try to do samples that mean something to your current work not just on pieces of calico. How likely are you to be machine quilting plain calico in the future? If you have no blocks then piece some simple nine patches and practice in the ditch sewing on those.







, Make a note of the tension number (if your machine has one) and the thread used. Experience will likely show different ""best"" tension settings for monofilament and machine quilting threads.

,, If you use no foot, keep checking that the foot lever is down or the tension will not be right on the top and keep your fingers away from the needle. The foot should stop you sewing right through your fingers but it might not!

,


Set the stitch length and width to 0.
Use the needle to bring the bottom thread up to the top of your work.
Hold both threads to the back of the work when you start stitching to stop them getting in a tangle.












, Relax, take a deep breath and press your foot so the machine runs fast and move the frame slowly in your hands.


Start by working loops of the letter e over and over again, trying not to speed up as you go round the bends.
To practice work in an open space but you may find it helpful to work inside a 2in grid, which could be machined on fed sewing before you start or you can draw it on with pencil.

, Repetition and practice definitely helps. Ideas for patterns are:


Cross hatch.
Scribble.
Circles.
Meandering.
Feathers.
Shells.
Leaves.

, Try lettering, your signature, or perhaps there are shapes from your mark making exercises or design work that could be translated to stitch.

, Make a note of the threads and machine settings used, especially how the threads behaved.

, Think about the density of stitching as well as the contrast between quilted and non-quilted areas.

Cut a piece of thread about 20"" (50.8cm) long.,
Push the needle down through all three layers of the quilt fabric and then up again about 1/4"" (6.35mm) away from the initial down stitch.,
Take the needle back to where it first went in and repeat the stitch.,
Cut the thread about 2"" (5cm) away from the stitch.",How to Hand Tie a Quilt," Use a strong, natural thread; you can use embroidery thread but crochet thread is also fine. You can even use wool, but be careful not to use anything too thick because it may be difficult to pull through the three layers of the quilt and thicker thread can tend to pull the wadding through the fabric.;
, Leave a tail of about 2"" (5cm) of thread to tie the quilt.

, This extra step is worth the effort to secure the knot.

, You should now have two threads both 2"" (5cm) long. Tie these in a double knot. You can leave the ends that length or trim them to about an inch (2.5cm). Trimming them any shorter than that is not recommended.

Continue to sew consecutive block pieces together in the order suggested by the pattern instructions, pressing each seam open and flat, until you have completed a ""block"" of sewing.

,
Set the block aside, and begin on the next block.

,
Lay all completed blocks out in the pattern as a final check before joining them together.",How to Hand Sew a Quilt1," Different fabrics have unique properties which determine how they will get used. Generally speaking, Cotton fabric is best for hand quilting, although other fabrics are sometimes used.;
, Quilts are created section by section (called ""blocks""). You do not need to carry a blanket around with you... only the materials for making one block, or one fraction, of the blanket at a time.

,, Most quilt patterns will give you a list of needed amounts of fabric yardage to complete a quilt in various common bed sizes... single, full, queen, king, etc.

, Some patterns will specify the best order of assembly for the block pieces... follow the pattern suggestions, as they generally work best.

,, Pin them, if need be.

,, Tie off the end of the thread when finishing each seam.

, This will make them stronger than if you ironed them ""open"".

,,, Generally, you will sew the blocks directly together or you will sew a lattice work of a contrasting color between the blocks. In either case, you will sew blocks together into long strips or rows and then sew the strips/rows together to make a finished quilt top.

Thread in the colors of your choice.
A shuttle with or without a hook. (If your shuttle does not have a hook, then you will need a small crochet hook as well.
Scissors.;
, To wind the shuttle, tie a knot around the center of the shuttle’s spool. Then, begin to wind the thread around the shuttle. Make sure to distribute the thread evenly as you wind it onto the shuttle. Cut the thread when you can’t add any more.


Wrap your thread around the shuttle until it just borders the edges of the shuttle. Don’t wind to much thread onto the shuttle or the string may get dirty.After you finish winding the shuttle, leave about 18 inches (46 cm) of thread hanging from the shuttle to begin tatting., Hold the shuttle between your index finger and thumb in your dominant hand. Then, hold the end of the thread with your other hand by placing the thread between your thumb and index finger. Then, spread out your other fingers and wrap the thread around them and back to your thumb and index finger to form a ring.Grasp this part of the thread with your thumb and index finger to secure the ring of thread on your fingers.

, Next, take the free end of the thread and wrap it around the middle finger of the hand holding the shuttle. This thread should create a half circle of thread, which you will use to create your first knot., Take the shuttle and insert it through the side of the ring that is facing you. Then, bring the shuttle up over the top of the ring and through the other loop you created. Pull the shuttle through and return it to your starting position., The next stitch is just a reversal of the first one, but otherwise it is the same. For the next stitch, you will also need to loop the thread over the middle finger of your hand holding the shuttle to form a half circle. Then, you will insert the thread over the top of the ring first, then down and through the ring and through the loop you created.Completing one of each type of knot (through and over along with over and through) is known as a double stitch in tatting.

, After you have completed the desired number of stitches or the number indicated by your pattern, you can pull the free end of the string to form a ring of stitches.Just pinch the stitches and pull on the free end of the string to form a ring. They should slide easily into place., A picot is a small decorative loop in tatting.Before you make your first picot, you will need to create a double stitch. Remember to complete two stitches for the double stitch. The first stitch goes through and then over the ring. The second stitch goes over and then through the ring., After your double stitch, go through and over like you are going to make a new double stitch, but do not pull the thread into a tight knot. Instead, form a loop and pinch it with your thumb and index finger. Then, slowly pull the thread enough to tighten the stitch at the base of the loop, but not enough to pull the loop through., Each picot should be secured between two double stitches. The stitch you used to secure the loop counts as your first stitch in the double stitch, but you will need to follow with another one to complete the double stitch.Complete the double stitch by doing an over and through stitch. Pull this stitch to secure it and then follow with another picot or a double stitch.
When you are finished with one picot, you should have a small loop secured between two double stitches.

, Picots are decorative, but you can also use them to connect rings. Use a small crochet hook or the hook on your shuttle (if it has one) to pull a length of thread through two picots and connect those rings together. You can also use a picot to connect a ring to a chain.To connect a picot using a crochet hook or shuttle hook, insert the hook through the picot you want to connect, and then loosen it slightly so that your shuttle will fit through it. Push the shuttle through the loop, then tighten the loop again. Follow this with a double stitch., Take the ends of the thread on two shuttles and tie them together. One piece of thread will be your base for the chain and the other will be your free end, which you will use to create double stitches and picots on the chain.You can also use chains to connect rings of double stitches and picots. To do this, you would need to tie your second piece of string to the ring next to the last double stitch instead of tying two pieces of string together., You will need to secure the bases of the two thread lengths to get started. The easiest way to do this is to pinch the knot you created between your thumb and index finger.If you are adding a chain to a ring, then you will need to pinch the string where you tied it to the ring., It is important to secure the end of the base thread so that it will stay taut while you are working. Wrap the free end of one end of the thread lengths around your pinky finger.Make sure that you leave a few inches to extend between the knot you are pinching and your pinky.
If you are adding a chain to a ring, then you will still need to do this. Wrap the string extending from the ring around your pinky finger. The ring thread will be your base for the chain and the new thread will be your working thread., Once you have secured the end of one length of thread, you can begin to create double stitched and picots on this thread.Hold the shuttle of your working thread and begin to create double stitches and picots as desired or according to your tatting pattern.

Keep adding double stitches and picots to your chain until you complete your project.

, To achieve a chain from a ring, you need to use the shuttle thread and a ball thread.

,, When you make the ring, use the shuttle thread in the regular manner.

, When the ring is completed and you wish to make a chain, turn it so that the base of the ring is held between the thumb and forefinger (see illustration).

, Do this in the same way as for the shuttle thread but instead of making a complete circle, wind it twice around the little finger to control the tension (see illustration).

, Do this in the same manner as in making rings. (Picots and joinings are made in the same way as on rings.) When you have finished the chain, pull the stitches close together and put down the ball thread.

Choose thread that is tightly twisted and highly mercerized.,
Consider using crochet cotton.,
Know the thickness ratings of the cotton.",How to Choose Threads for Tatting1," The thread must be smooth and firm. The mercerized thread will provide both sheen and ease of movement along the tatting shuttle.;
, This is a fairly standard tatting thread that works well. A common brand is Coats Mercer-Cotton.

, Crochet cottons are numbered and the higher the number rating, the finer the thread is. Knowing the rating is important, as different projects require different thread weightings and different levels of ability. For example, very fine thread should only be worked by the very skilled and advanced tatting enthusiast, whereas thicker threads will be far easier for beginners. As such:


100 is very fine thread
10 or 20 are very thick threads
40-80 are considered medium threads and tend to have a good range of colors.

"
"
Be careful when choosing wool as your tatting thread of choice.",How to Choose Threads for Tatting2," Wool can be used for tatting but the yarn quality is vital. The wool must be very smooth in its texture; avoid any wool that shows signs of fluffiness, knotting, grabbing, etc. If you're not sure, test it first by sliding a piece up and down the shuttle to see how easily (or not) it glides when pushed. A wool that slides easily will be suitable for the tatting project. Also check the instructions for your given project and see the note in ""Tips"" below.

"
"
Consider using nylon ribbon.",How to Choose Threads for Tatting3," This works well for tatting providing you test first that it slides well in the shuttle. It can be a boon for items that need to be durable, such as coasters, placemats, etc.

"
"
Give it a try.",How to Choose Threads for Tatting4," If you want to know whether those spare, smooth threads sitting in your sewing box will tat well or not, there is nothing like trying them. Do the test of checking to see if the thread glides well in the shuttle first; if it does, then try a mini tatting project, or even just a few elements of a project and judge with your own eye whether or not the result is desirable.

"
"
Use two or three strands of thread loosely twisted together.,
Use different colors to create a variegated effect.",How to Choose Threads for Tatting5," Keep the thread unknotted. For this technique, it is best to use the finer threads.


The idea here is that two or three fine threads roughly equates to working with a single medium-sized strand of thread.
Use threads 60-80 for this technique.

, You can also work parts with just one thread to create both texture and coloring effects as you so desire. Of course, you can't carry thread the way you can in crocheting or knitting, but it still can be done to a certain degree. Just experiment––you are only limited by your imagination!

Size 10 cotton crochet thread is a great choice for beginners, or you can go with another kind of thread that appeals to you.Keep in mind that a small number on a thread size means it is actually wider than another thread with a larger number thread size. For example, a size 10 thread will be larger than a size 40 thread.;
, You also need a shuttle to tat. A shuttle is a spool with two pointed ends that are open, but that only allow the thread to pass through when you tug on it. This will help you to control the thread as you tat.


Shuttles can be a little difficult to find. Check your local craft supply stores or buy a tatting shuttle online.

, You will need to cut the thread regularly while tatting. Make sure that you have a sharp pair of scissors handy., The only other tool you use for tatting is your hands. Both of your hands will be engaged when you are tatting. You may want to remove your jewelry to keep it from snagging on the thread., The shuttle has a small hole in the center of it which you will use to start threading your shuttle. Insert the thread through the hole and pull it out by a couple of inches on the other side. Then, place one finger over the hole to hold the thread in place., With your finger still on the thread, begin to wind the thread around the spool. Do this a few times to secure the thread, and then remove your finger and keep wrapping. Wind the thread around and around the spool until the thread is nearly even with the outside of the shuttle.Do not wind the thread so much that it extends out past the edge of the shuttle.

, When you have finished winding the shuttle, cut the thread to separate it from the thread spool.Your shuttle is now ready to use for tatting!

, To position your thread, you will need to have about 18 inches of thread available. Unwind this amount from your shuttle to get started., Grasp the shuttle at its center with the thumb and index finger of your right hand. It is important to hold the shuttle this way so that the thread can flow freely and unwind as you work.Do not hold the shuttle by the sides or tips because this may prevent you from unwinding the thread.

, Next, you will need to grasp the end of the thread. Press the end of the thread between the thumb and index finger of your left hand. It is important to grip the thread in this way so that your other fingers will be free to move the thread around as needed., Once you have a piece of thread pressed firmly between your thumb and index finger, spread out your other three fingers as if you are forming an “OK” sign. Then, loop the thread around these fingers to form a loop and press the other end of the thread between your index finger and thumb to secure the loop.Your shuttle, thread, and hands are now positioned to begin tatting.

, When you are just starting out with tatting, you will need to learn how to do double stiches. This is a very basic stitch that only requires a couple of different movements. The first movement is to insert the shuttle through the loop you have created. Pass the shuttle right through the center of the loop.Double stitches are usually abbreviated at “ds” in tatting patterns., Next, you will need to bring the shuttle up on the other side of the loop and then bring it over the top of the loop. As you do so, come downwards slightly with the shuttle and bring it through the new loop. Then, pull the thread to tighten the knot you just created., The next part of the double stitch is just the opposite of the first part. Instead of coming through the loop, bring the shuttle over the top of the loop., Next, bring the shuttle down and through the large loop. Then, bring the shuttle up slightly to come through the new loop you created. Pull the thread to tighten the knot.This completes one double stitch! Make several of these for practice when you are just starting out in tatting.

Half Cross Stitch: This is good for small areas, but not for covering large ones, as it will distort the shape of your canvas. Start at the top left of your canvas or block of color. Work from left to right in a row across the canvas and then return. You will see as vertical stitch on the ""wrong"" side of the canvas.







Tent or Continental stitch: This is the same as the previous stitch concerning use. Start at the top right. Work from right to left and then return. You will see a diagonal stitch on the ""wrong"" side of the canvas.







Basket Weave: This stitch allows good coverage of the canvas with the least distortion and should be used in large areas. Work this stitch diagonally, starting at the top right hand corner of the area. The ""wrong"" side of the canvas should resemble a basket weave.







Backstitch: This stitch is used for stitching a very small piece or outlining an area using thread.







Blanket stitch: This stitch is used to finish the edges of a project.





;
, Choose a project that you feel you will have the skill and patience to complete. You could buy your own mesh canvas and draw your own design if you like. Buy a tapestry needle that fits comfortably through the mesh size you've chosen.

, Keep your excess yarn organized too!

, This will keep the edges from unraveling. Use one inch wide or smaller tape. You can also hem the edges with a sewing machine.

, This outline will be used later to ""block"" the canvas once stitching is completed.

,, It is generally best to select the smallest amount of color or most detailed area first. Then stitch the larger areas that surround the more detailed bits.

, To keep your embroidery floss from tangling, keep the tags on and cut the skein where it loops over. The strands are the perfect length for stitching and the paper bands keep everything together. Pull a single string from the remaining loop.

, Hold the thread in one hand and the needle in the other (eye up). Insert the tip of the thread into your mouth and flatten it with your teeth. Insert the tip of the thread into the eye of the needle. Pull the thread through until its tail is one or two inches long.

, This is called a waste knot and will keep the thread from going through the canvas. You do not have to use one if you do not prefer to do so. Simply press the string against the ""wrong"" side of the canvas with a finger and secure it as you stitch along.

, Pull the thread through to the ""good"" side from the ""wrong"" side. You should be underneath the intersection of two threads of the canvas.

,,,, If the string becomes mussed, this is another good sign to stop. On the ""wrong"" side push the needle through three or four stitches and pull the string through. It isn't completely necessary, but it is generally a good idea to snip off the excess string.

, Be patient and take breaks if you become bored with your project. Try changing the area you're stitching.

, Belts and keychains are almost always finished in this way, but other projects such as pillows are finished differently around the edges.

, Remove the canvas from the frame (if you used some), dampen it (don't saturate it) with water, lay it (good side down) on the outline you drew before you started stitching (with a surface you can nail underneath) and stretch it out to its original shape. Pin it down with tacks or nails at one-inch (2.5 cm) intervals all the way around and allow to dry before removing. Repeat as needed., framing or making it into a pillow).

,, ""Blocking"" is the process of pulling/steaming the fabric back into squareness if your stitching has inadvertently pulled it somewhat off of square., It should be cut from a sturdy material. Allow at least an inch (2.5 cm) of seam allowance over and above your needle point pattern.


Note: Avoid using thin materials such as poplin, sheeting, etc. Use something heavier like Twill, Corduroy, Denim, etc. instead.
Also: You should NEVER cut into your stitched pattern. Avoid even cutting closer than a half inch to your needle pointed area. The canvas unravels easily in most cases, and you will need that canvas area to sew your backing to.

,,,,,, If you stitch on the exact line, it's okay, but two lines around 1 centimeter (0.4 in) apart work well. You can also ""zigzag"" or ""Satin Stitch"" outside of your main seam with your sewing machine.,, (too much force, and you'll poke through the seams and have to re-sew the corners...)

Remove your embroidery hoop and enjoy your finished monogram.",How to Embroider Monograms1," A monogram can consist of one, two, or three letters, although three is the most common. Allow yourself to play with different combinations of upper and lowercase letters, as well as different fonts, to make sure your design flows naturally and beautifully.Remember that the size of your sketch should be the same size as the monogram you would like to embroider.
You can also find various designs for monograms on the internet or in embroidery design books. Select a monogram of your choice and adjust it to make sure it is the right size to embroider on your fabric.;
, Once you have decided on the monogram design and the piece of fabric you will use, you need to decide where you want the monogram to be placed. Mark the area in which you are going to place the monogram with tailor's chalk or any fabric marking tool.


It's a good idea to at least make a horizontal line on the fabric, which will serve as the bottom point for all your letters, assuring they are not crooked. This will allow you to better visualize how it will look when finished and will help you transfer your design to the fabric.
When hand embroidering, you will need enough room around the design to attach an embroidery hoop. Make sure that you have at least two inches of fabric around the outside of every edge of your design. It would make embroidering very difficult if you did not attach an embroidery hoop around the area you are working on, as an embroidery hoop keeps the fabric taut while you are sewing on it.

, Place a piece of carbon paper under the paper on which you have sketched your monogram. Then place both pieces of paper onto the fabric. Use a pencil to trace over the lines of the motif, this will transfer your sketch to the fabric via the carbon paper. Once the tracing is done, remove the carbon paper and the motif paper off the fabric. Your monogram should be clearly transferred on to your fabric.


Make sure your fabric is placed on a firm surface and that the pieces of paper are in the correct position (you may need to lift up the edges of both papers to make sure your design is aligned with the lines you drew on the fabric).
When your tracing is done, be careful while removing the carbon paper such that it does not leave any extra marks on the fabric.

, Secure a wooden or a plastic embroidery hoop around your design area. Choose the color thread you would like to use, making sure that it goes well with the color of the fabric you are embroidering on. Start embroidering on one edge of your design and work your way across.


Monograms are traditionally outlined with a back or split stitch and then filled in with a satin stitch.Complete the outlines of your letters first, then follow by filling in the letters. If you don't know how to do these stitches, you may want to visit How to Backstitch and How to Satin Stitch to learn how.

, Remember to trim any loose or long threads that remain. The finished monogram should add a delightful design element to whatever you have affixed it to.

Set up your sewing or embroidery machine.,
Decide where to place the monogram.,
Place your machine's embroidery hoop onto your fabric.,
Set your hoop in place and start your machine.,
Detach the hoop from the machine and take your fabric out.",How to Embroider Monograms2," Plug in your machine and place it somewhere that will allow you to enough space to move your project around freely. Program your machine so that it will produce the size and shape monogram you want.


In order to create a monogram with a sewing machine, it will need to be one that has an embroidery function. Many modern sewing machines have integrated advanced electronics that allow you to embroider preset designs, most of which include monogram motifs.
Follow your machines instructions on how to choose which design you will use and how big it will be.
Don't forget to thread your sewing machine with the color thread that you would like to use. The color should go nicely with the color of the fabric you are monogramming.

, Mark the center point of where your monogram will go with tailor's chalk or any fabric marking tool. It is best to make a vertical line and a horizontal line coming out of the center point of where your design will go. This will allow you to line up your embroidery hoop in the correct position.


Remember that you will need enough room around your design so that your machine's embroidery hoop will fit around it, with your design in the center. If you are worried about space, measure your hoop or place it on the fabric when deciding where your design will go. In many cases, the position of the design will be determined by where the hoop will fit.

, Make sure the center lines you drew on your fabric are lined up with the center marks on your machine's embroidery hoop. This will make sure that the machine embroiders your monogram in the right spot.


You will need to place a piece of stabilizer under your fabric inside the hoop. The piece should be a bit larger than the hoop, so that it covers the whole underside of your fabric. Stabilizer supports your fabric while being sew by your machine, making it sturdy enough to withstand machine embroidery.Don't worry, once your monogram in sewn the stabilizer can easily be cut, washed, or torn away (depending on the type of stabilizer you use)!

, Your machine's embroidery hoop should snap in place, so that it will move freely as the machine moves it during embroidering. Be sure to follow your machine's instructions when attaching the hoop to the machine. Once the hoop is secured in place, start your embroidery program and watch your machine do all the work!


Make sure that your hands and any other items are away from the machine while it is operating! The hoop, with your fabric attached, needs to be clear of obstacles so that it can all move freely.

, Trim away any excess thread left by the machine. All you need to do now is remove any excess stabilizer from the back of your fabric. Follow the instructions that came with the stabilizer, whether it be to cut any excess off, rip the excess off, or wash the excess off. Now your monogram is finished!

",How to Make Lace Flowers," You can also purchase remnants of lace edging or ribbon on the Internet or at many thrift stores., You can run one or two layers through your sewing machine to improve the look of the lace. Layer your lace and run it through a ruffler foot attached to your sewing machine.


A straight stitch through a ruffler foot will result in pretty gathered ribbon for your flower., You can fold the lace fabric horizontally and run it through your sewing machine and ruffle foot to create a finished edge that will not break or fray.

, It will create a multi-colored flower.

, Cut ten inches (25cm) of lace ribbon for a large flower. Use sharp fabric scissors to improve the edges.

, It will provide the backing for your flower. Since lace is a delicate and opaque fabric, a contrasting color will likely show through the lace flower.

, For small flowers, use a circle that is two inches (5cm) in diameter. For a large flower, cut a circle that is four inches (10cm) in diameter.

, Keep in mind that the finished edge should be on the outside of the flower. The unfinished edge, if there is one, should be glued to the interior of the felt.

, You can also use very strong fabric glue, as long as it is applied with a fine tip applicator.

,, Make sure you set the rough, inside edge against the glue, instead of your finished edge. Allow the glue to set for five minutes, so that it doesn’t come loose while you wrap the ribbon around the felt.

, As you wrap it, it will gather into a circular bloom shape.

, Wrap your lace ribbon around that edge in a circle. When you come to the starting edge, you will bring the lace inside to spiral it in a petal pattern.


Hold the lace in place and allow the glue to set for five minutes, if the lace is slipping away from the felt circle.

, Wrap the lace in a spiral and press the edge onto the glue. Repeat the spiral of glue and lace until you come to the center of the circle.


Press the lace down with a toothpick or pencil to avoid burning yourself with hot glue.

, Use a matching thread and a needle to secure the center of the lace on the felt circle as you would a button.

, It will look like a style, or center, of the flower. You may want to choose a contrasting color to improve your flower design.,"

, The nylon chiffon fabric should be approximately 108 inches (2.7m) wide.

, You may choose a similar shade to the nylon chiffon, or a different color.

, This can take longer than cutting other fabrics because it can slip easily. You will need several different strip widths.


Cut 3 strips that are 6 inches (15.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long.
Cut 6 strips that are 4 inches (10.2cm) wide and 108 inches (2.7m) long.

, Cut an elastic that is approximately that long, taking off extra for a tighter waist band, or adding extra for extra room.

, In order to connect the first strips, you will want it to be set to a 4:1 gathering ration.


This means that you are going to gather more on your 2-inch (5cm) strips than you will with your 4-inch (10.2cm) and 6 inch (15.2cm) strips. The many ruffles will create a pettiskirt full of body.
You will be making 3 layers of nylon chiffon ruffles to comprise the body of the skirt. Make each of the layers 1 at a time.

, Feed them into your ruffler foot. Feed them through your sewing machine until you have run the entire length of the 4-inch (10.2cm) strip.


You will need 4 times the amount of 2-inch (5cm) strips than 4-inch (10.2cm) strips to account for the ruffling ratio. You will need 4 2-inch (5cm) strips for each 4-inch (10.2cm) strip you gather. Either pin the new 2-inch (5cm) strip to the end of the last strip in advance, or simply feed in the next 2-inch (5cm) strip by hand when the last is finished.

, It should be a 2 to 1 ratio.

, You will need 2 of the ruffles you made to sew to the length of the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip.


You may want to pin the 2 4-inch (10.2cm) strips end to end on the 6-inch (15.2cm) strip before you start sewing.

Make a small poodle out of black or white felt and sew it on.,
Finished!

",How to Make a Poodle Skirt," First, find a big piece of any colored fabric for the overskirt. It needs to be lightweight, in order to move when you wear it, but should also be stiff. A vintage flat bedsheet is ideal.


Note that most traditional poodle skirts are made using felt fabric for the overskirt. If you don't have felt, or don't wish to use felt, you can also consider using taffeta.;
, Then add 2"" for seam allowance — we will call this number 'W'. Now take a measurement for your desired length (around knee length is traditional) and add 2"" again — we call this 'L'.

,, So if your waist measured 21 1/4"" + 2"" seam allowance, your semi-circle would be 11.5"" wide.

,, The waist requires another calculation: c = π(d) or d = c/π. Remember that radius is half the diameter and π = 3.14 — this will give you how far down from the point to cut.


So if your waist is 21 1/4, divide by 3.14 to get a diameter of 6.77. Half of this is your radius, so divide by 2 (3.38) and this is how far down to cut from the point of your fold. Remember to measure the hem from this line as well rather than the point or your skirt will be several inches too short.

, It may help to pin the layers together if your hands aren't steady. It'll resemble a giant donut once you're all done cutting.

, Afterwards, stitch around the cut edge.

, Don't stitch all the way around; leave a gap of 2"" open.

, The elastic should measure 0.5"" less than your original waist measurement (in this example 29.5"").

, Since most fabrics won't stretch to form a folded circle, tiny clips may be necessary to make the fabric lay flat.

, If you don't wish to sew on the appliqué, use a steam-adhesive product such as Steam-a-Seam, which are available in craft stores and online. If you want to experiment with other appliqués as well. Popular designs include:


Dogs
Hot-rods or other '50s cars
Flamingos
Flowers
Really large initials. Remember the L for Laverne?

Finish the waistband.",How to Make a Skirt1," You can use any fabric to create this skirt, and you will need elastic that measures ½ inch -1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. To create a more structured skirt, use a stiffer fabric material. To create a looser more flowy skirt, use a light and airy fabric.;
, Use a soft measuring tape to find the distance around the widest part of your hip, smallest part of your waist, and the total length of the skirt. To find the length, you can use the measuring tape from your hips to the desired level on your legs and add 2½ inches extra for the elastic casing.


, Use your measurements to cut 2 large rectangular pieces of fabric the length of your choice by the distance around your hips. Cut your elastic band to be the length of your hips, minus one inch (if your hips measure 30 inches, your elastic should be cut to 29 inches).


, Lay the two rectangular pieces on top of each other so that they are even. Give each piece a ½ inch seam allowance, and sew them together. Use an iron to flatten the seams when you are finished (or before if you are having trouble keeping your fabric flat).









, The elastic of this skirt will be hidden inside the fabric, so you will need to make the fabric casing to cover it up. Fold the top ½ inch of fabric over and use an iron to press it. Then, fold the fabric an additional 2 inches (5.1 cm); use a top stitch to secure this section along the pressed area to the body of the skirt. Leave a 4 inch (10.2 cm) opening near one of the seams to add the elastic.









, Fold the bottom section of the skirt over ½ inch. Use your iron to press the fabric and pin if necessary to hold it in place. Use a top stitch to sew the hem in place.









, Slide your cut elastic into the elastic casing you’ve created. Pull the elastic through the loop, and when you get to the other side sew the two pieces together using a straight stitch. Use a safety pin to hold the elastic in place while you slide it through, if necessary. Use a top stitch to close the opening, and a backstitch to reinforce the seam.









, Adjust the gathered ruffles around the top of the waistband so that they are evenly spaced. When you have the gathers adjusted to your liking, stitch in the low areas to attach the ruching to the elastic. Don’t stitch across the gathers as this will flatten them out; only stitch in the spaces between the gathers.

Hem the skirt.",How to Make a Skirt2," Circle skirts are known for their flowy appearance, so it is best to choose a material that isn’t too heavy or stiff(we recommend flounced garments). The waistband is made from exposed elastic, so choose an elastic in a width and color that you like. A wide waistband measuring 3 inches (7.6 cm) or more is a fun way to top off your skirt.

, Use a soft measuring tape around your hips where you would like the skirt to sit, typically the widest part. Because this is a circle skirt, a bit of geometry is necessary to find the measurements. To find the radius of the skirt, take your hip measurement and add two inches. Then, divide this number by 6.28; the answer is the radius of your circle.



For example, if your hips measure 30 inches (76.2 cm), add two additional inches and divide by 6.28 (32 / 6.28). This will give you a radius of about 5.1 inches (13.0 cm).
Measure the elastic by adding one inch for a seam allowance to your total hip measurement. If your hips measure in at 30 inches (76.2 cm), your elastic should be measured and cut to 31 inches (78.7 cm).
Measure the length of the skirt by using a soft measuring tape to find the distance from your hips to your desired end point. Add an extra inch of length for seam allowance.

, You will only need to create a paper cut for ¼ of the skirt, so choose a piece of paper large enough to occupy a sketch of that size. Use your measuring tape and place your pencil in the hole at the end. Find the measurement for your radius (or as close as you can) and hold this spot on the measuring tape to the bottom left corner piece of your paper. As you hold the tape with your left hand. use the pencil in the hole to swivel from edge to edge of the paper with your right hand. You should be left with a quarter of a circle, with the corner being the center point.









, Choose the length you would like for your skirt. Use your measuring tape to mark this distance from the line you just made for your hip radius in another ¼ circle. Draw from edge to edge of the paper, with the starting point of the distance being the line for your hip measurement. You should be left with a rainbow shaped ¼ circle strip from edge to edge of your paper.









, Cut out your paper along both of the lines you created, making a curved band. Fold your fabric in half and then in half again, leaving you 4 folded sections. Place the paper pattern over the corner where all the fabric is connected, and cut out along the outside of the paper. When you unfold the fabric, you should have a large ring or donut shaped piece of material.


, To finish the waistband section of fabric, you will need to press and serge the edges. This will keep the raw edges from unraveling through wearing and washing. Fold down a section of fabric ¼ inch from the top of the skirt and use an iron to flatten it out. Then use a serger (if you have one available) or use a zig-zag stitch to finish the seam.









, The elastic is a bit smaller that the fabric around the waist to allow give when you put the skirt on. Because of that, the two ends must be sewn together first before being added to the skirt. Fold the elastic in half, and use a straight stitch to sew the pieces together with a ½ inch seam allowance. Then, fan the edges out away from each other and sew them flat back onto the elastic, so that there isn’t a bump on the seam when the skirt is worn.









, Your skirt should gather slightly around the elastic because of the enlarged size. Place the waistband along the top edge of the elastic, and pin the skirt evenly around. Use as many or as few of the pins as you need in order to get an even gather around the entirety of the waist.









, With your elastic pinned to the fabric, begin to sew around the edge with the elastic on the outside of the skirt. As you sew, stretch the elastic so that there are no loose sections where the fabric and elastic are not attached. You can use a straight or a zigzag stitch for this.









, Fold over the bottom ¼ inch of the edge of the skirt and use an iron to flatten it out. Then fold this section over again, and use a straight or zigzag stitch to hem it all the way around the edge.

Find a fabric that is a bit thicker so that it is not see-through and will have enough weight to keep the skirt from blowing around. Use a wide band of elastic to create the waistband at the top; the elastic will be exposed, so choose a color that matches the fabric of your skirt.


Try to choose fabric that is large enough to be cut in a single piece. This maxi skirt tutorial uses a single length of fabric, rather than two (or more) smaller pieces sewn together.

, The two necessary measurements to make a basic maxi skirt are your hips and length. Use a soft measuring tape around the widest part of your hips where your skirt will sit. Then, measure from that point down to your ankles (or where you want the skirt to end). This measurement will probably range somewhere from 40–70 inches (101.6–177.8 cm) depending on your height.


Measure your elastic for the waistband by taking one inch off your hip measurement. This will make your elastic just tight enough that it won’t slide off or create an awkwardly loose band.
Add one inch of extra fabric to both the length and the width for seam allowances.

, You should measure a large rectangular stretch of fabric with the width being the measurement around your waist and the length being your desired length of the skirt. Cut out this shape and fold it in half with the two cut ends touching.

, Fold over ½ inch of fabric on either edge of the length and iron it down to create a flat seam. Then use a zigzag stitch along this length to secure the two sides of the fabric, creating a tube.

, Turn the tube of fabric inside out so that you can work along the top stretch of the material. If you have a serger, serge the edge of the fabric to keep it from fraying. Otherwise, use a zigzag stitch to stabilize the ends.

, Take your cut piece of elastic and fold it in half, with the two cut ends laying on top of each other. Use a straight stitch ¼ of an inch from the edge of the cut. Then, turn the elastic loop inside out and fan the two bits leftover from the sewn ends away from each other and use a zigzag stitch to attach them back onto the band. This will cause the seam to lay flat and be more comfortable and attractive when the skirt is worn.

, Place the top of the skirt inside the elastic band and pin it in place. There might be a bit more fabric than elastic band width, so pin it evenly around so that any gathers that may form are equidistant from each other.

, Use a straight stitch around the width of the skirt ¼ of an inch up from the bottom of the elastic. Remove the pins as you go, making sure to keep a straight line so that your waistband is even.

, Fold the bottom ½ inch of the skirt up and iron it to create the hem. Use a zigzag stitch or serger to keep the bottom edge of the fabric from fraying. Then, use a straight stitch to attach it to the body of the skirt.

Before buying elastic, measure around your waist where you want your skirt to sit. This is how long your piece of elastic should be. You will also need a measuring tape and washable marker, a pair of sharp scissors, a needle, thread, and pins.;
, You can buy a simple skirt pattern either online or at a fabric/craft store. It might be easier to buy one at a store, because online patterns are often too large to print on a normal printer.


Many patterns also come with suggestions for the types of fabric and thread that would work for the project, so it’s a good idea to buy the pattern and check those out first before buying your other materials.

, Lay your printed pattern over your fabric and pin the two together. Then cut carefully around the edge of the pattern. Depending on the pattern you buy, you will likely have two matching pieces when you’re done: one for the front of the skirt and one for the back.







, Sew the front and back pieces together on the right and left edges. Make sure the “right” side of each piece (the side of the fabric you want showing on your skirt) is facing in, against the other. Sew evenly along the edges with a simple stitch.









This is a good point to carefully try on the skirt (you can keep it inside out). If it needs to be smaller at any point, take it in by stitching parallel to the inside of your previous line of stitching.

, Fold over a half inch of the fabric at the bottom of the skirt and sew the hem using a hemming stitch.

, If you buy a pattern with an elastic waist or room for a zipper, you will need to sew that next. Place your piece of elastic at the inside top edge of your skirt and stitch the two ends of the elastic together. Then fold that top edge of the fabric down, so that the elastic is encased in fabric. Sew this “casing” around the elastic by stitching the fold to the main skirt, much as you did with the hem."

Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground as you wrap it around your hips. Stick your thumb under the tape measure as you pull it taut to prevent yourself from accidentally making it too tight.;
, Use a soft tape measure to measure around your waist, just a little above your waist or where your waistband would usually rest.









This may or may not be your natural waist, depending on how high you want the waistband of your skirt to come. Your natural waist is the skinniest part of your waist and usually crosses over your belly button.
Keep the tape measure parallel to the ground as you wrap it around your waist. Stick your thumb under the tape measure as you pull it taut to prevent yourself from accidentally making it too tight.

, Use a soft tape measure to measure the distance between your waist and your ankles, or whatever length you want for your maxi skirt.









Ankle-length is the standard length for maxi skirts, but you could make the skirt fall out anywhere between your lower-calf and ankle and still call it a maxi skirt.

, To make a simple, comfortable, stretchy maxi skirt, you will need to choose a knit fabric with a bit of stretch to it.









Choose knit fabric that is dark and/or heavy enough to block out light. Otherwise, you might need to wear a slip beneath your skirt.
Choose a fabric with at least 25 to 40 percent stretch. In other words, if you cut 10 inches (25.4 cm), it should be able to stretch to a length of 12.5 to 14 inches (31.75 to 35.5 cm).
Preferably, the fabric should not have much four-way stretch, since this will cause the skirt to become longer as time goes on.

, The exact amount of fabric and elastic you need for the skirt will vary based on your measurements.









Do not buy ""no-roll"" elastic, since this type of elastic cannot be sewn into the fabric.
The elastic should be about 3 inches (7.6 cm) wide.
You will probably need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) to 2 yards (1.8 m) of fabric, but the exact amount will depend on your measurements. You should have enough fabric to wrap around you and enough to drape down to your desired length, at minimum. It's always recommended that you buy a little more fabric than you expect to use, just in case you make a mistake or in case you need more than you originally expected.

, Doing so pre-shrinks your material and makes your skirt ready to wear once complete.









Follow the care instructions for your fabric and for the elastic to determine the proper way to wash them.

, Fold the fabric in half, paying careful attention to the grain of the knit so that the elasticity runs in the right direction.









Fold your fabric so that the right sides are facing each other and the wrong sides are facing out.
The grain of the knit fabric should run horizontally, or from side to side, rather than top to bottom., The top of your skirt should be half your waist measurement with an added 1 inch to 2 inches (2.5 cm to 5 cm) for a seam allowance.The bottom of your skirt should be a total of 12 to 13 inches (30.5 to 33 cm) wider than your full waist measurement, so with the fabric folded in half, the bottom should be marked out as being 6 to 6.5 (15.25 to 16.5 cm) longer than the top.









The top and bottom lines should be center-aligned with each other.
Make sure that the distance between the top and bottom marks matches your desired skirt length, plus 1 inch (2.5 cm) for a seam allowance.
Make your markings using a washable sewing pencil or piece of white chalk.

, These lines will become the sides of your skirt. They should flair out gently from the ends of the top line to the ends of the bottom line.









Note that if you make one of the sides correspond to the fold of your fabric, you can save yourself time by reducing the number of sides you will need to stitch up in half. If you cannot figure out how to create an angled line on the fold of the fabric, though, you can still cut the fabric out without either side being on the fold.

, Pin the two layers of fabric together and use sewing scissors to cut two funnel-shaped pieces of fabric out according to the pattern you just drew.









If you have a rotary cutter and cutting mat, use that instead for a more even, cleaner cut. Sewing scissors will work just fine in most cases, though.
Take special care as you cut the fabric to prevent it from being stretched as you cut. If the fabric gets stretched as it gets cut, the pieces could end up being distorted.

, With the wrong sides still facing each other, sew along the angled lines, using roughly a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance on each side. Stitch up these sides completely from top to bottom.









Check the width of the waist at this point. If it is too large and too loose, pin off the excess and sew in a little more to take the waist in. If it is too small and too tight, remove some of the stitches and resew the seam to make the waist larger.
Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine. If sewing the skirt by hand, use a backstitch to provide greater strength.

, Fold the bottom of the skirt up by about 1 inch (2.5 cm). Pin in place before sewing it down.









Use a straight stitch on your sewing machine. If sewing by hand, use a backstitch or special hem stitch, instead.
When you fold the bottom up, make sure that the raw edge is folded over the wrong side of the fabric and that you tack the hem up from this wrong side to hide the stitching better.

, The fabric should be the same length as the circumference of your waist, with an added seam allowance of 1 inch (2.5 cm).









Make sure that the grain of your waistband fabric goes in the same direction as the grain of your skirt.
The piece of fabric for your waistband should initially be about 10 inches (25.4 cm) tall. When folded in half, this will give you a waistband that is 5 inches (12.7 cm) tall.

, Pin the elastic band to one side of the waistband fabric and sew a straight line down the lengthwise center to hold it in place.









The elastic should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) shorter than your waist measurement, but it needs to be able to stretch to match your waist measurement. If it is the same exact length as your waist measurement, though, it will not have as much holding power, so you skirt may end up feeling loose.
As you sew the elastic, stretch it slightly so that it meets with the ends of the waistband fabric.

, Fold the top of the waistband fabric over so that it overlaps the elastic band you stitched to the lower half. Sew along the lengthwise raw edges to complete the waistband piece and stitch together the open ends to form a full, connected circular band.









When you fold the open ends together, fold the waistband in half with the wrong side facing out. Stitch the ends together with 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance on either side. When you turn the waistband right side out, this seam should be hidden.

, Pin the waistband to the top wrong side of the skirt. Sew in place.









Match the waistband seam to one of the side seams on your skirt.
Pin the waistband so that the bottom right side edge of the waistband overlaps the top wrong side edge of the skirt. In other words, the waistband itself should be above the skirt and not on top of it.
Use a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance on either side.

, With the skirt right-side-out, flip the waistband down and over the top.









When you initially fold the skirt right-side-out, the wrong side of the waistband should be visible. By folding the waistband down and over the top edge of the skirt, you turn the waistband right-side-out, as well.

, This skirt is durable, comfortable, and fashionable. Best of all, with this step, your maxi skirt is also complete!

This will ensure that you will be cutting an equal amount off all around the skirt. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a ruler or measuring tape instead.








, If your skirt has a lining, cut the lining 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter.








, Be sure that you are folding towards the wrong size of the fabric (inside the skirt). If you have a serger, or if your serving machine has an overlock stitch, you can skip the folding and use that instead. When you are done, remove the sewing pins.

Cut carefully.,
Tidy the edges.,
Measure the hem.,
Sew the hem.",How to Make a Mini Skirt2," A longer skirt that you don’t wear anymore, but that still fits at whatever part of your waist you want to wear it, is ideal. Then you will need a measuring tape and washable marker, a pair of sharp scissors, a needle, thread, and pins.


Note that different materials are harder to cut and sew. Denim or corduroy skirts might be more difficult, requiring sharper scissors and/or thicker needles.
Find thread that matches the most prominent color in your skirt so that it blends into the fabric.

, A common school guideline and a generally good rule is to have the skirt end at least where your longest finger reaches when you have your arms straight down by your sides. Or, grab another mini skirt you like and measure the length. Use the tape measure to find these measurements and mark them on the skirt with your marker.


Add another half an inch to your measurement. This accounts for the hemming that you will complete later.
When in doubt, cut less. You can't get fabric back once you’ve cut it, so cut off less than you think and then try it on. You can hem it up to exactly the right length afterwards.

, Cut slowly along the marks you’ve made, keeping the edge as even as possible.


To help you cut straight, make several measurement marks as you did in the previous step all the way around the skirt to ensure that it will be the same length everywhere.

, When you are done cutting, there might be loose strings hanging, depending on the fabric. Carefully trim these off if they occur.

, Try on your skirt after you cut it. If it’s at about the right length, fold approximately a half inch of fabric back against the inside of the skirt and pin it all the way around. This is your hem.


If you want the skirt to be slightly shorter than where you cut it, your hem can be larger—an inch or more. Fold the amount you want it to be shorter underneath and then pin it in place.

, Using your needle and thread, stitch the folded section to the main fabric of the skirt, removing the pins as you go. You can use a hem stitch, but really any stitch will work as long as it secures the fabric.


To do a hem stitch, insert the needle into the hem and then through a tiny section in the main skirt, just above the hem (this shows just a tiny dot of thread on the outside of the skirt). Pull the thread through, firmly but gently. Then, insert the needle into the underside of the folded hem and pull it through to the top. Repeat this stitch all the way around the hem, with even spacing between each “dot.”"

, Consider using a hem gauge to measure up from the bottom of the skirt to the cutting point. This will help ensure that you are cutting an even amount off all along the hem. If you don't have a hem gauge, you can use a measuring tape or ruler instead.


If you are cutting a skirt lining, cut it 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) shorter than the skirt itself.

, Try to use a higher thread tension for this. This will help make the hem easier to fold later on. It will also create a sort of guideline for you, so you won't have to make as many measurements.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.

, Lift the iron up and down as you press; do not move it side to side. You should have a ¼ inch (0.63 centimeters) wide hem inside your skirt at this point.

, Because the folding takes up some excess fabric, your hem will be about 5/8 inch (1.59 centimeters), as opposed to an exact ½ inch (1.27 centimeters)., If your sewing machine has an edge stitching foot attachment, consider using that instead.The edge stitching foot is often labeled as a #5 foot.Use a thread color that closely matches your fabric.

Sewing machine or sewing needles and thread
Zipper
Fabric scissors
Clear protractor
Ruler
Fabric tape measure
Paper
Pencil;
, The trick to a perfect pencil skirt is making sure you have all the right measurements to ensure a good fit. The four main measurements you need are your waist, hip, leg circumference and total length.Your natural waist is the smallest part of your torso.
Your hip measurement needs to be taken around the widest part of your butt.
Measure around your legs where you want the pencil skirt to end. This can be either just above the knees or right below the knees for a traditional pencil skirt style.
Measure the length starting from your natural waist and down to the point you want the skirt to end.

, While you want to have accurate measurements, you need to add room for the seam allowance, and give yourself enough room to walk and sit. A pencil skirt will have three seams that each require 5/8"" for the seam allowance. In addition, you will want to add about 1/2"" to 3/4"" ease at the waistline, and about 2"" to 2 3/4"" wearing ease at the hips., The fabric is completely up to you. You can choose cotton, wool, polyester, or any material you would like to create your skirt. Just be sure that you understand the washing instructions of each fabric so that you can properly care for your skirt.


Inspect the fabric you want to use to see how much give the material has. This will give you a better idea of how it will wear and fit on your body.

Add your first strip.,
Add additional strips.,
Finish adding your strips.,
Sport your new tulle tutu.",How to Make a Tulle Tutu1," Being so sheer, a lot of tulle is necessary to create a wearable tutu. For a small tutu skirt (child size) use between 2–4 yards (1.8–3.7 m) of fabric. For a medium tutu, you will need between 5–7 yards (4.6–6.4 m) of tulle. A large tutu can be made using 8–10 yards (7.3–9.1 m) of tulle.;
, The waistband of a no-sew tutu is simply an extra long piece of ribbon tied around the waist. Choose a ribbon that is at least ½ inch thick and is wire-free in a hue that matches the tulle. Wrap it around your waist where you want the tutu to sit, and add an extra 2 feet (0.6 m) of length before cutting.

, Lay your tulle out flat, and cut it into dozens of long strips measuring between 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) wide. For a fluffier, fuller skirt, use wide strips. To create a tutu that lays down a bit more and looks more intricate, use thin strips of fabric.

, In order to add the tulle strips to the ribbon, they must all be folded in half first. You can choose to do this as you work, or fold them all in half at the get-go. This should leave two tail ends together at one end with a loop at the other.

, Place a strip folded in half over the top of the ribbon. Move it so that the loop overlaps the ribbon with about 2 inches (5.1 cm) sticking out over the top. Wrap the tail ends in the opposite direction away from the loop, and then pull them around and through the loop over the top of the ribbon. This will create a classic hacking knot.

, Continue the process of adding strips via hacking knot to the ribbon. Pull the tail ends tight to minimize the ‘knot’ around the ribbon and to make space for other pieces. Slide them together to keep the tutu organized and smoothed out.

, The ribbon needs 1 foot (0.3 m) of length on either end to be used as ties for the skirt. When you have added enough tulle strips that the ribbon is completely covered except for these two tail ends, your tutu is finished.

, Wear your tutu around town by wrapping the ribbon around your waist and tying it in a knot or bow at the small of your back. Gently fluff up the tulle strips to add volume to your skirt, making your tutu more fun and adding to the classic look."

Keep the front piece of fabric as one piece, and then cut the back piece in half down the middle.Use a pencil to write out your measurements, and use a ruler to accurately place the measurements., For the back, you will need to add a vent extension to provide you room to move your legs and walk. Add 1 1/4 inches to the bottom back edges of both back pieces where the slit will start and end. At the top of that extension, make a 45 degree angle that cuts up and back.To help you cut evenly, use a clear protractor.

, Once you have the proper measurements for the front and back pieces, cut them out, and use them to cut your fabric. Be sure to use sharp fabric scissors.

, Turn the fabric inside-out, and then sew about 5/8"" inward along the sides of the skirt., You can decide to press the center back of the seam above the vent to the left or right side when you begin sewing the seam closed.When you get to the top of your skirt, don't sew it completely closed. Instead, baste the top where the zipper will go by using larger ""temporary"" stitches that will hold the fabric in place. These stitches can more easily be removed when needed.

, Most pencil skirts will have a better fit if they have a zipper. Place the zipper at the back of your skirt in the center. Sew on the zipper around the seam while it is still basted closed. After you sew on the zipper, you will be able to remove the larger stitches., Flip the bottom up by about 1"", and tuck it inside the fabric so it is hidden. Sew the top of your skirt closed by also tucking it in about 1"" inside the fabric. Make sure you do not sew closed your bottom slit or top zipper when finishing the hem lines., After you are finished, feel free to go back and make adjustments to the length or size if you feel the skirt is too small or too big. It is easy to take a skirt in, but letting a skirt out can be tricky. If you need more room, use a seam ripper to undo your seam lines, and sew closer to the edge."

Finish your tutu.",How to Make a Tulle Tutu2," For a tutu that you sew, you will need to get plenty of fabric. For a small child’s tutu, get between 2–4 yards (1.8–3.7 m). A medium sized tutu can be made using 5–7 yards (4.6–6.4 m), and a large one with 8–10 yards (7.3–9.1 m). You will also need elastic for the waistband, matching thread, and a sewing machine.


You can hand stitch your tutu, but it will take a very long time and a lot of effort.
For a short skirt, your tulle needs to be at least 54” thick. Find tulle that is wider than this for a longer tutu.

, Fold your the entire piece of your tulle in half width-wise (making your 54” into 27”). Then, fold your skirt in half again in the same direction, thus creating four layers of tulle.

, Wrap the elastic band around your waist where you want the tutu to sit. Pull the elastic taut so that there is no space between it and your skin. Cut the elastic to this length, with no overlap of the ends.

, Sew directly across the length of the tulle using a straight stitch, about 2” (or slightly wider than your elastic) down from the top of the fold. You should be sewing along the the edge of the tulle that you have folded twice, through all four layers of tulle.

, Use a crochet hook or similarly long, sturdy device to scrunch up the tulle along the top by the casing. When it has been pushed together, slide the elastic through the casing. Make sure to keep both ends outside of the casing; a safety pin can be used to keep the elastic in place as you pull it through.

, Pull the two ends of the elastic together, and sew them together about ¼ an inch from the edge with a straight stitch. Then fold the loose ends back onto the elastic waistband and sew them flat with a zig-zag stitch.

, Your tutu is nearly finished, but needs to be sewn together along the back side where the two ends of the tulle meet. Pin the edges of the tulle together, and sew down about ¼ of an inch from the edge with a straight stitch. Make sure to sew through all four layers of fabric, and not just the top layer.

, Separate all the layers of the tutu with your hands to fluff it up. You can add optional decorations to your tutu, including small rhinestones, fake flowers, and ribbons."

Sew the elastic onto the skirt with a zigzag stitch.",How to Make a Poodle Skirt Without a Pattern and With Minimal Sewing," Making a circle skirt requires a bit of basic geometry, but it is easier than it might seem. First, you will need to measure your waist to get your skirt's waist size. Use a tape measure and then write down the measurement. Then, add two inches or 5.08 centimeters to this measurement.


For example, if the waist measurement is 30 inches, the skirt's waist will need to be 32 inches.You are making the skirt's waist a little bit larger because you will need to bunch up the material.;
, You will need this number to help you cut out the right size waist for your skirt.


For example, if your skirt's waist is 21 inches, then your first radius will be about 3.34 inches.

, Use your marker or some tailor’s chalk to make a mark on this point. You will be using this point to create half circles that will help you to mark and cut out the waist of your skirt.


If your felt is black, or a dark color, try using a light-colored fabric pen or a piece of chalk.

, You will need to create a compass using a piece of string, a pen, and a pin. This will ensure that you cut out the waist in the correct measurement.


Take a long piece of string and tie it around a pen. Then, measure the end of the string extending from the pen. It will need to be the same length as your radius. For example, if your radius is 3.34 inches, then measure the string to this length. Tie a knot, do not cut as cutting the string will leave a frayed edge that the pin will instantly slip out of. This way you can use ONE string with three knots: one knot to pin the string to the fold of the fabric, a second knot for the waistline circle, and third knot for the hemline circle. Waist and hemline knots must be at correct distance from center-top pin.
Then, pin the end of the string to the mark you made in the felt. You will be using the pen and string like a compass to draw your circles. You might need to anchor the pin to the table with tape to keep it from dragging the fabric around as you draw the half-circles.

, Leave the fabric folded in half and pick up the pen. Make sure that the string stays pinned to the fabric. Start on one side of the fold and swing the pen around to the other side. You will end up with a half circle extending from one side of the fold to the other side.

, Next, you will need to find the length of your skirt. Add this number to your radius. This new number will be your new radius.


For example, if your skirt is going to be 24 inches long, and your first radius was 3.34 inches, then your new radius will be 27.34 inches., Take the old string off of your pen and discard it. You won't need it anymore. Then, take a new piece of string and tie it to the pen. Measure the new string extending from the end of the pen. It should be the same length as your new radius.


For example, if your new radius size was 27.34 inches, then you should have 27.34 inches of string extending from the end of your pen.
Then, pin the end of the string to the middle of the fold again and draw a second half circle above the first one. You should end up with something that looks like a rainbow, or half a doughnut.

, Do not use pinking shears; the felt fabric will not fray so they are not necessary. Cut through both layers of felt at the same time. This will help to ensure that your skirt is even.


Also, try to cut just inside the lines you drew. This way, the pen marks won't show.

, You can purchase a ready-made, iron-on poodle appliqué in a craft store or cut one out of some black, white, or grey felt. There are many free patterns for the poodle cutout that are available online.


Try searching for “poodle outline,” or “cat outline,” or “giraffe outline” or whatever type of animal you want on your poodle skirt.
If you are confident in your artistic abilities, then you can also try drawing the outline of a poodle free-hand.

, You can either iron the poodle appliqué on, use some fabric glue to attach it, or use a hot glue gun with a small point. The attachment will be instant with the hot glue for both the poodle and the leash, and will hold better than fabric glue. If you use fabric glue, then you will need to let the glue dry overnight. Try placing a heavy book over the poodle to help it bond with the felt as the glue dries. To iron on the poodle applique:


Place the poodle onto the skirt, close to the hem, and cover it with a piece of fabric (preferably cotton).
Set your iron to the hottest setting (no steam) and press down on the patch for 35 to 45 seconds.
Turn the skirt inside out and place the piece of fabric on the back, right where the patch is. Press down on it again with the iron for another 35 to 45 seconds.
Take the piece of fabric off and switch off your iron. Let the patch cool down before adding the leash., Apply a line of fabric glue going from the top of the poodle's neck up to the waistband of the skirt. Add a few loops to the line. Next, press down some thin ribbon, rickrack, or sequin trim onto the glue. Let the glue dry before moving on to the next step.

, Use a fabric measuring tape to measure your waist. Then add one inch to this measurement. The total will be the length of your elastic.For example, if your waist measurement is 28, then you will need to have 29 inches of elastic.

, If you are making the dress for a child, try to use a two inch (5.08) wide elastic. If you are making the dress for an adult, try to use a three inch (7.62) wide elastic. Black is the most popular color, but a white elastic might look cute against a black skirt.

, Use a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) seam, and knot the ends of the thread. Snip off any excess thread when you are done sewing.

, Turn the elastic so that the seam is facing you. Use your iron to press the two edges down. They should be facing away from each other, and rest flat against the elastic. Topstitch them down.


Be sure to knot the ends of the thread, and to snip any excess off. This will help prevent the elastic from fraying. It will also give you a nice, clean finish on the inside.
A sewing machine will give you the cleanest finish, but you can also use fabric glue to tack the two edges down instead.

, The seam of the elastic should be on the inside. The waist/top hem of the skirt and the bottom edge of the elastic should be overlapping by ¼ inch (0.64 centimeters).


Keep in mind that you will not be flipping the skirt inside out. You want to have the entire waistband visible when you are done sewing.

, Make sure that you stretch the elastic as you sew to ensure that it will be evenly sewn onto the felt. This will allow your waistband to stretch better. Keep sewing until you get to the end of the elastic.


When you are done sewing, you should have a sleek waistband for your skirt. Your poodle skirt is now ready to wear!

Most tutus fall between 11 in. (28 cm) and 23 in. (58 cm) from the waist.;
, You’ll need a piece of elastic that is about 4 in. (10 cm) shorter than the waist measurement.


Glue the ends of the elastic together.
Use a generous amount glue over the area to ensure the elastic will not come apart.

, This will ensure it is tight enough around the waist. Adjust it, if necessary.

, Tulle comes in many different colors and can be found in fabric stores or arts and crafts stores. Look for 6” wide tulle, in your chosen color.Most tutus are a solid color, but different colors of tulle can also be used together.

, It is better to have extra tulle on hand in case of mistakes or for making corrections.


For a tutu skirt for a small child, purchase at least 10 yards (9 m).
For an adult, purchase at least 15 yards (13.7 m).

, How long or short depends on how long you want the skirt to be and how tall the person wearing it is. Generally, you should take the desired finished length of the tutu and multiply it by 2. Then, add 1.5 in. (3.8 cm) to that number to get the strip length. Make each strip 3 in. (7.6 cm) wide.









So, for example, if the length of the finished tutu will be 20 in. (50 cm), cut the tulle into strips 41.5 in. (105 cm) long and 3 in. (7.6 cm) wide.
It’s a good idea to make the tutu 3” to 4” longer than you think it need to be, as once it starts puffing out, it will seem a lot shorter. You can always adjust the skirt to make it shorter, but you cannot make it longer once the tulle has been cut., Wrap the tulle around the cardboard and slip your scissors under the wrapped tulle, on each end of the cardboard, to cut the tulle on both ends.Keep in mind pre-cut tulle is 6’ wide, which is the right width for the skirt. If you’re using pre-cut tulle, you just have to unroll the tulle and cut each strip to the proper length as you go.

, Sometimes, tutus that are flat across the bottom can look a little dull.








Cut several pieces at once at an angle to speed up the process. Don’t worry about keeping the edges very tidy, as you want to add texture to the tutu.

, Do this by folding the tulle strips over the elastic band. Then, glue the two layers together just below the elastic with a glue stick or glue gun.


Repeat this process for all of the tulle strips until the circle is complete.

, If you don’t have access to a glue stick or glue gun, you can knot the tulle one piece at a time onto the elastic.








Take a piece of tulle and fold it in half. Wrap the looped end around the elastic and pull the other ends up, around, and through the loop. Then, pull the tulle tight, securing it around the elastic.
Repeat the ties until the entire elastic band is covered in tulle. Make sure you gradually push the knots around the elastic together so that as the elastic stretches, there are no gaps in the tulle.
Feel free to mix and match or layer colors of tulle on the elastic to create a unique look.

, Have the person try on the tutu to make sure the length is correct and it is easy to move or dance in.

, Add ribbon by tying them or gluing them onto the elastic. If you want to add buttons, flowers, or other embellishments, simply pin them onto the tutu or onto the elastic."

Measure the width of your pocket.,

Cut your tulle.,
Cut the tulle into strips.,
Cut the elastic to 5cm (2 inches) longer than hip/waist measurement.








,
Loosely tie the ends together to make one big circle.








,
Fold one strip in half.,
Finished!",How to Make a No Sew Ballet Tutu," Measure around the waist. Measure the length you want the tutu to be. Cut the tulle to 2x the waist and length. You can also triple the waist if you want a fluffier tutu.






;
, Holding the tulle with the longest side facing you, Cut about 2.4 inches (6 cm) of vertical strips.








,,, Making a loop with the top, pass it under the elastic and pull the tails through the loop. The strip is now attached to the big circle. Repeat making and tying on the strips until you have tied strips the whole way around the circle of elastic.









For a fuller and fluffier tutu, pull the tie tighter (you would need more strips and at least another 1 meter (3.2 feet) or more for an adult).
With these measurements, 10 loosely tied strips will cover 15cm (6"") of length, which is more than adequate for a fun tutu. For the more elaborate tutu, the tightest knots of 10 strips will cover 5cm (2"").

, The result is one reasonable tutu from 1 meter (3.2 feet) of net (tulle) and it is long enough for a child or a small adult, limited only by the length of the elastic. It can do the job as it is or be dressed up by adding another colour, a circular cover skirt, a few spangles, sequins or rhinestones. Enjoy.

, Consider selecting silky blouse or skirt fabric instead of the usual plain lining sold by most stores. A printed lining is a fun addition to a solid colored coat. Stay away from stretchy fabrics, knits, and crayons.

, This is an iron-on type of fabric 'stiffener'. Interfacing is a light-weight product that is ironed to the back side of most collars, lapels and some coat fronts to help them keep their shape.

,, Do have someone measure you first so that you buy the correct pattern size.

, Check the back of the pattern envelope for all required notions. Thread selection should match your coat. The sewing needle should be larger than average if your fabric is thick. A size 14 needle will be good for heavier fabric. If you want to add double stitching (like you see on denim), consider topstitching with a double needle. This shopping project can be done at home in your free time.

, You may decide to find your pattern online. If not, go to a craft supply, sewing, art, quilting shop, fabric store or hobby store and look for the pattern catalogs and pattern packets. Most will show a picture of the finished product so you can consider how closely it matches your inspiration. Look at the back of the pattern envelope for details in the seam lines. The back will also list sizes and fabric needs.Pattern prices can range from a dollar (at a yard sale) to about $20 for a new pattern.

, If you are new to this project, look for a minimum of seam lines. Go for the more 'tunic' look to start. A collar with lapel is a more advanced project, but a simple standing collar can be a good way to start.

, For an easy way to change a pattern, try different colors for collar and lapel, or design the patch pocket shape.

, For a winter coat you will need the correct weight and texture, as well as other qualities like water fastness and more.

, Read through the entire pattern. Look for any confusing, challenging, or foreign parts. Compare those steps with your sewing book. Maybe the book will have a better idea for sewing a difficult area. Be sure to research those parts before you begin!

, Lay out your paper pattern on the wool. Be sure to keep the grain line (arrows) going up/down with the wool. You can use heavy books to hold the patterns in place while you make adjustments in placement. Pin down the pieces when you have everything in place. Cut evenly, with smooth slices. Your scissors should be 8"" long. Don't use dull or short shears. Some people like to label each piece after they cut with a note on the back side of the wool. This way you won't get mixed-up or loose pieces when you sew.Lay the fabric flat on a big table or a clean, smooth floor. Your pattern may require a center fold. Make this parallel to the selvage edges.

, Pin the paper pattern together, keeping a 5/8"" seam allowance. Carefully try this paper pattern on over a shirt or top. You will have a half-garment in paper. Have a friend check the fit: shoulders? back? bust/chest? length? arms? Make any tucks with pins. Clip any tight spots and widen that area with a paper patch to make it bigger. When the fit looks good, you are ready to cut your fabric.

, Clip threads after each seam, backstitching each line of sewing. Press each seam open. Iron on the fusible interfacing with paper on the ironing board and over the fabric to protect the iron from the sticky residue. Take your time. Keep your pieces in order by storing them in zip lock bags. Stop when you are tired.

, When the coat body is complete, try on the coat for fit. Have your friend check this. length? shoulders? chest/bust? collar? If you need to take the body in more, do this before you add the sleeves. Take in the sleeve side seam the same amount as the body side seam so they are still the same. If your coat needs shoulder pads for a classic look, put those in when you fit.

, Final pressing: Use a damp linen towel or cloth between the wool and your iron to press the coat. You may find that taking it to a dry cleaners for a pressing will be even better.Well, it's done!!!

You will need to learn each type of tool and how to use it. In the beginning you won't be comfortable with all the tools, but the more you practice, the easier it will become.









Iron and ironing board. It's fine to use whatever quality iron you already have, but you'll probably want to eventually invest in a higher quality one. You'll be using the iron to press the item being sewn as you are sewing as this makes sure the seams stay open properly.
Seam ripper. You'll use this when you've made a mistake to rip out the wrong stitches.
Chalk for marking the fabric so you know where to sew and where to cut.
You'll need a really nice, sharp pair of scissors that you designate for cutting cloth only, otherwise the scissors will dull more quickly and can damage or fray your fabric.
Tracing paper for drafting your patterns and modifying the patterns as you're sewing.
Rulers for drafting and measuring while you're constructing your piece (both in the design stages and the sewing stages).
Tape measuring, especially a flexible tape measure. You'll use this to take measurements and make fit adjustments if you need them.
Pins for holding the fabric in position before you start sewing. Pins should be used only sparingly as they can distort the fabric that you're working with.;
, There are basically two types of sewing machines, ones that fall into the household








Household sewing machines tend to be more portable and more versatile. They tend to do a variety of stitch types. However, they don't work out as well in terms of speed and power, and they aren't very good with heavy fabrics.
Industrial sewing machines are much more powerful and much faster, but they tend to only be able to do one type of stitch (such as a straight lockstitch). They do that one stitch very well, but aren't terribly versatile. They also tend to take up a lot more room.

, Hopefully your sewing machine will come with an instruction manual, because that will tell you which direction the bobbin is going to spin and where the bobbin case is. However, you're going to need to know at least the basic components of your sewing machine before you can get making fun things.









The spool holder holds the spool of thread and controls the direction of the thread while it goes through the sewing machine. Depending on the type of machine you have, your spool holder might be horizontal or it might be vertical.
Bobbin is basically a spindle that is wound with thread. You have to wind the bobbin with thread and fit it into the bobbin case (which is found under the needle plate).
Your sewing machine also has different stitch adjustments to help determine stitch length for each stitch, the amount of tension needed to make sure the stitches come through properly, and the different types of stitches (if you have the type of sewing machine that does different stitch types).
The take up lever controls the thread tension. If the thread tension isn't at its proper level the threads will knot up, jamming the sewing machine.
You can check with a nearby sewing shop to see if they have any classes or know anyone willing to help you get set up with your sewing machine, or you can ask a knowledgeable family member or friend.

, When you're just beginning with making clothes you'll want to start out with simple designs, otherwise it's easy to get frustrated and quit. It's best to start with skirts, because these are easier to make than say a 3-piece suit and they require you to take fewer measurements.









When you're first starting, try to avoid making clothes with buttons or zippers. Do aprons or pajamas with elastic bands. Once you've gotten the hang of your tools and your sewing machine, then you can start advancing.

, The best way to make your final piece the best it can possibly be is to make test clothes beforehand so you can tweak your design and make any changes to the final piece as you see fit.









It's recommended to use scraps from the same fabric as the final piece.

, Even if you're making clothing from a pattern that you found somewhere, instead of creating one yourself, you're still going to need to take your measurements so that the clothes will fit you when you're finished.









For trousers, you will need the following measurements: waist, hip, crotch depth and full leg length from waist to floor. For shorts, use the trouser measurements you have, only shortening the pant length to the desired length.
For shirts, you will need the following measurements: neck, chest, shoulder width, arm length, armhole length and shirt length.
For skirts, you simply need waist and hip measurements. The length and fullness of the skirt will vary depending on what type of skirt you want to make.

, Sketch a pattern for your garment using the measurements you took. Use a similar garment as a guide for the appropriate pattern design and layout. There are lots of good places you can find pattern ideas.








Second hand stores and sewing shops often have fun vintage patterns (especially for dresses) and there are lots of easy patterns to be found online.

, Deciding how to lay your pattern pieces out will take some careful planning.









Fold the fabric, right sides facing together, matching selvage to selvage. The selvage is the finished edges of the fabric that keep it from unraveling. Folding it like this will provide for easy cutting of double pattern pieces (sleeves, legs, etc.) and large symmetrical pattern pieces.
If you have large pattern pieces that are symmetrical and can be folded down the middle (shirt back, for instance), then fold the pattern piece down the center and pin the folded part of the pattern on the folded edge of the fabric. This saves cutting effort and ensures the cut fabric piece is perfectly symmetrical.
To make clothing that hugs the body, it is best to lay pattern pieces on the bias (at a 45 degree angle to the folded edge).
To sew a garment that has no stretch, place the pattern pieces at a 90 degree angle to the folded edge.

, You have to make sure that your fabric is wrinkle-free otherwise it can screw up your final piece, if the wrinkles make the fabric come out of alignment.








, This will tell you wear to cut. Make sure that it is still wrinkle-free and that the pattern pieces and the fabric are aligned properly.








, Be sure to cut through both layers of fabric.








, You're ready to get started with the sewing process.








, Determine which edges you must seam together and pin the 2 fabric pieces together, right sides facing together, at the seam edges. Insert the pins at a 90 degree angle from the edge so you don't have to remove them as you sew a garment.








,









This will take time, so try to be patient as you work. If you mess up at all, don't worry, that's what your seam ripper is for.

, You need to make sure that you have the correct needle for the task and the correct thread. Different types of thread and different types of needles work best with different types of fabric.









You'll need different techniques for animal fiber fabrics like silk or wool or alpaca, as opposed to natural fibers like cotton or flax and synthetic fibers like rayon or polyester. Make sure that you know the type of fabric you're using and what type of needle and thread will work best with it.
Gently guide the fabric through the machine. Don't push or pull your project, because the machine is supposed to do that itself and you can clog the sewing machine or ruin your garment.

, Make clothing complete with clean, finished edges.









Fold the edge up, wrong side facing in, to the desired width of the hem and press the fold together. Fold the pressed edge up 1 more time and press again. Now, Sew along the top folded edge of the hem, inside of the garment.

, This could be anything from buttons, elastic, zippers to various fun embroidery or special stitches. The better you get at sewing and making your own clothes the more creative you can get with adding those finishing touches.








, Since every style of clothing is a bit different, there are some key points for each that are good to remember when you're choosing what clothes you want to make and how you want to make those clothes.








There are lots of different types of skirts to choose from: a-line skirts, circle skirt, flared skirt, gathered skirt, maxi and mini skirts, pencil skirt, pleated skirt and the list goes on. You'll need to decide which skirt you want to try out.The most basic skirt that you can make is a tube skirt, which requires an elastic band and the fabric (a stretchy kind is good). You can make this in about an hour and they are fun, comfortable and easy to wear.The general order that you sew a skirt in is: side, front, and back seams, zipper or closing method, waistband, hem.

, Since trousers are incredibly versatile and can be made out of just about any fabric, they are a great project to do once you've gotten the basics down. You can make them more easily by making trousers that have an elastic waistband, or you could get more complicated with zippers and buttons and waistbands.









The general order that you sew a pair of jeans (or other trousers) is: pockets, side, front, and back seams, zipper or closing method, waistband, hem.

, Again there are tons of different kinds of dresses to make, from some short, sweet summer cotton, to a long flowing ballgown. Dresses can be more complicated than, say, a skirt, so you'll want to hold off making one of these until you've got the basics down.









The general order that you want to sew a one piece dress is: interfacing, the shaping shoulders, side seams, top part of dress except for hem, bottom part of dress, back, and front seams. Then you join the skirt bottom to the bodice top of dress at the waistline, attach zipper or buttons holes, hem.

, Although fun to make, these can be a bit more complicated, since you'll need to do buttons and sew on curves (since you're sewing along the lines made by your neck and your shoulders). There are also more patterning pieces that you will have to deal with.









The easiest type of top to make is a throw over knit top without buttons or pockets.
The general order that you want to sew a shirt (or a jacket) is: interfacing, the shaping shoulders, zippers or button holes, shoulder seams, side seams, neck and front edge, armhole, sleeves, hem.

, Jackets and coats are one of the more complicated clothes-making projects. They are something you will want to hold off on making until you've gotten a good amount of experience since they include buttons and pockets, working on contours rather than straight lines, and are made from lots of patterning pieces.









The easiest jacket type is one that doesn't have a lining or that doesn't have to be sewn into sleeves.

Sew around the pinned material.",How to Hem Clothing by Hand," It is essential to have the person try on the article of clothing for a fitting to allow you to pin it to the correct length.;
, Place them about 3 inches (7.5 cm) apart all the way around the material. Turn it inward as you put in the pins.

, Take the item off carefully to avoid scraping pins on your model.

, Make sure that the thread matches the color of the material as closely as possible.

, This provides the strength needed for a hem; the hem takes a lot of punishment from daily wear. (To double the thread, put it through the needle and bring both ends together, tie them in a knot.)

, If the clothing is extremely long, measure and cut some of the excess material off, but leave about 2 inches (5 cm). Finish the raw edge of the fabric so that it does not fray. If you want to let the material out later, simply fold it over a few times, making an edge about two or three inches thick.

, Take up as little fabric as possible with the needle on each stitch. Try to place stitches about 1/2 inch (1.5 cm) apart. You can sew by hand or with a sewing machine, depending on which way suits you most.

Mark your fringe lines.,
Cut your shirt.,
Stretch out the strips.,
Knot the fringe.,
Crisscross knot the shirt.,
Stagger the fringe.,
Bead the fringe.",How to Fringe a Shirt," To create your fringe shirt you will need a few materials:









A t-shirt (men’s t-shirt provide a looser fit, women’s t-shirts provide a tighter fit)Sharp scissors (fabric scissors work best)
Ruler
Chalk or fabric marker
Decorative beads(optional);
, Put on the t-shirt. Stand in front of a mirror and use the chalk to make a provisional line across the front of your shirt where you want the fringe to start.









Keep in mind that depending on how high you cut the fringe, you may be exposing your stomach. Some people like this look, while others prefer for the fringe to start around the waist of their pants or shorts.

, Lay the shirt down on a flat surface such as the floor or a table. Measure the distance from each armpit of the shirt to each end of your drawn chalk line.This will help determine if your line is straight and even on both sides.










If the two measurements are different in length, measure again and mark the place needed to make the chalk line straight and even. Then lay your ruler across the shirt and redraw the horizontal chalk line, connecting the two even measurements.
For example, if the chalk line to the left side armpit measures 7 inches (17.8 cm), and the chalk line to the right side armpit measures 5 inches (12.7 cm), determine which length you rather have. Measure and mark the corresponding length on the side of the shirt you’re adjusting.
Once both ends of the chalk line are equidistant from the armpits, connect the two markings to even out your chalk line.This line will be where you stop cutting the strips of fringe.

, Lay your ruler on the drawn chalk line and use your chalk to mark ½ inch intervals where your strips will be cut.Once you finish marking the top of the shirt, lay your ruler on the bottom of the shirt and again, mark out ½ inch intervals where you are going to cut your fringe strips. Then, lay your ruler vertically on the shirt, and connect the ½ inch marks.This will give a clear line on which to cut your fringe.










You could also free cut your strips without marking lines to cut along, but cutting along measured lines will make your shirt look less sloppy.If you plan to thread beads onto the fringe, thinner strips will allow the beads to slide onto the fringe strips more easily.

, Cut the bottom hem off of your shirt, right above the top stitching. Use your scissors to cut along the vertical ½ lines you measured for your fringe. You can cut both sides of the shirt at once.Just be sure that both the front and back of the shirt are spread out and flat when you start cutting. Stop cutting once you get to the top chalk line.










The first and last strip you cut will be on the sides of the shirt. That means that the side strips will actually be an inch thick since it’s a ½ inch on the front of the shirt connected to ½ inch on the back of the shirt. Cut these thicker 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips in half down the middle, to make them the same as the rest of your fringe strips., When all the fringe strips are cut, use one hand to hold the t-shirt down and in place. Use your other hand to tug on the bottom of the strips, to curl in the cut sides and make the strips look more like fringe.









You can leave your shirt as it is for a basic fringe top, or you can further embellish your shirt even more unique look.

, Take two neighboring fringe strips, and knot them about an inch down from where the strips begin.Do this for all the strips on your shirt.










You can leave your shirt like this with small knots going around your shirt, or you can add another layer of knots to give your shirt a crisscross knotted look., Once you have small knots going all the way around your shirt, knot together a right strip from one knot, with a left strip from an adjacent knot, and knot those two strips together about an inch down from the original knots.









Keep knotting together outside strips from adjacent knot pairs, to create a crisscross effect in your shirt., Stagger the fringe by simply cutting some of the fringe strips to make them shorter than others.You can try cutting every other strip shorter, only the strips in the back of the shirt, or random strips.









, Slide decorative beads onto the strips of fringe. You can add as many beads as you want, but most fringe looks best with about 1-3 beads on a strip.Once you’re finished sliding beads onto a strip, make a small knot at the bottom of the strip to keep the beads in place.










You can add beads to a plain fringed shirt, a shirt with crisscross knots, and staggered fringe shirts. It’s all about personal preference. Experiment to see which look you like best.

Select your fabric.,
Cut the panels.,
Fold each panel in half.,
Sew your panels all together in a row, selvage to selvage starting at the hip cut, ignoring any difference at the bottom, as this is the side you will cut and hem.,
Put your skirt on a clamping slack hanger and hang it high.,
Put on your giant, uncut skirt.,
Hem the skirt with a machine by rolling the fabric between your thumb and forefinger and guide it through the machine without stretching.,
Make an over-skirt from leftover fabric.,
Put on your full belly dance skirt, the over-skirt, and a belly dance belt and you are ready to dance!

",How to Make a Full Belly Dance Skirt," For instructional purposes 5 different color panels, 2.75 yards (2.5m) each, were used. You will probably want one solid color. This fabric had some gold sari-like brocade trim on it, which for the most part will not be a part of the main skirt. With the leftover fabric, you will be able to make a petal-like over-skirt. You will need approximately 12 to 14 yards (11-13m) of 45” (1.14m) wide fabric (see Tips about costs). If you are very tall and your favorite skirt is 42” (1m) or longer, you may need to buy 60” (1.5m) wide fabric not 45"". Polyester chiffon is the popular choice. It comes in a variety of colors, you can wash it, and it doesn’t wrinkle like silk. Silk chiffon works as well and it is great for stage when accompanied by a large silk veil. For a tribal style, plain old black cotton sheeting can be used, but you must add extra inches to your hem length, since cotton doesn't roll like chiffon, and you must make a folded hem.;
, Measure around your hips (C) (your hip measurement or (C)circumference)and the length (L) of your favorite belly dance skirt. Calculate your hip diameter (D) by dividing your hip measurement (C) by 3.14. Use this formula to calculate how much fabric you need for each panel: (2 x L) + D = one panel, add 2-3 inches (5-7.5 cm) to each panel for seam allowance at hips and a rolled hem (or add 5-6"" (12-15 cm) for cotton/folded hems). If you can, let them cut the fabric into panels for you at the store. The length of each panel is most important. Be generous and round up. Skimping on fabric does not make a less full skirt, it makes an uneven hem with shortness at the seams. Add some extra to the last panel for two waist-bands.

, Calculate the hip portion you will cut from each panel by dividing your hip measurement by number of panels. Then divide this number by 2. For mathematicians: /2. You divide by two because your fabric is folded. Use this number as your arch. At the top folded corner, using a tape measure as a guide, cut one small portion of your hip circumference from each panel. (click on photo to see more detail).

, Mind which side is inside and which side is out, if your fabric has sides. Pin then sew a waistband casing tube to skirt, and sew together the final selvages. Thread elastic and finish. If what you have now looks like a giant Amazon handkerchief skirt, you did it right!

, Let it grow longer for a week or two. The weight from the extra fabric will stretch the bias. You can help by pulling down on each of the fabric points hanging down. You are accelerating something that would eventually happen with age, thus making a new skirt with a perfect hem uneven with time. Letting the fabric hang and grow will keep your hem straighter for years longer.

, Stand on a low stool so that the pointed ends of the skirt can touch the floor, but the place you are marking should hang freely. Recruit a friend to operate the hem marker. Aim the marker one inch (2.5cm) or more below your intended hem. This allows for you to roll your hem. Aim two inches (5cm) or more below your intended hem for cotton fabric with a folded hem. Your friend must carefully ""poof"" a chalk line around all 25 yards (22.9 m) of hem (this is the approximate circumference of a 5 panel finished skirt; you'll need to know this if you want to add some decorative trim). Save your leftover fabric to make the petal over-skirt.

, You may also serge the hem.

, You will find two usable, somewhat triangular pieces leftover from each panel. Cut them into uniform shapes and hem. Attach them to a waist-band and thread with elastic.

Round up the ingredients for the volcano from the kitchen.,
Pour the salt, flour, and oil into the mixing bowl.,
Pour the water into a large mixing bowl, adding 2-3 drops of food coloring if wanted.,
Mix and kneed the ingredients with your hands.,
Let the dough dry for 1-2 hours before shaping.,
Create a protective surface.,
Get your lava container.,
Shape your clay.,
Allow the volcano to dry overnight, or cook it for one hour at 225F.,
Put the baking soda in the volcano.








,
Prepare some vinegar.,
Add the vinegar mixture into the container.,
Run away!",How to Make a Clay Volcano," You'll be making a simple dough, much like Play-Doh. You'll need:


6 cups of flour
2 cups of water
4 Tablespoons Vegetable Oil
2 Cups of Salt
An old plastic water bottle, cut in half.
Food Coloring (optional);
, Through all of the ingredients into the same bowl so that you can mix them up. It can help to pre-sift the flour with a whisk, sift, or fork to get break up big chunks.








, Adding the food coloring to the water will help it distribute evenly, meaning your whole volcano will be the same color, not streaky.









If you don't want to add food color, you can paint the volcano with acrylic poster colors after setting up the clay.

, Mix and then knead until a dough is formed. Get squishy, molding and mixing until you have a bit yellow ball of dough. You can use a rubber spatula to help get it off the sides of the bowl, but use your hands to form a nice, consistent ball.Make sure the clay is neither too watery nor too dry. It should be in a format which allows us to shape it.









If the dough is dry as you work, add a tablespoon or so of water.
If it is wet, through in a little more flour.

, You want it to be wet enough to work with, but not so dry that it crumbles or falls apart. You can always add a touch more water if need be, but try to be sparing.

, Lay down a sheet of wax paper, a thick layer of newspaper, or a box or tray which you can line with tinfoil.








, This container will be the center of your volcano. You can use lots of different containers like soda cans, mason jars, plastic bottles, and so on.








, Starting from the bottom and working your way up, place your clay around the volcano to form the outside. Try to make it lumpy and uneven, since volcanoes rarely look like perfect cones!








, Shape your volcano first and then let the dough set. As this is technically playdough (rather than clay), you will want to let it set for about 24 hrs to get dry and hard before completing your project. If you're in a hurry, put it in the oven for about an hour on low heat to dry it out quicker.


Do not forget to paint your volcano when done!,, Add red food coloring to the vinegar. Mix in a tablespoon of dish washing soap to add an extra bubbly final effect!








, Using a funnel might make this easier.








, The toilet paper will dissolve, exposing the baking soda to the vinegar. This will cause the volcano to erupt!

, Some Scottish regiments and other regiments in various parts of the world have their own tartan patterns. If you area member of a particular regiment, or otherwise have a direct connection to it, that tartan would be a good choice for you.


Check out various regimental tartans here: http://www.scotclans.com/whats_my_clan/regimental_tartans/


,


Older, more traditional options include Hunting Stewart, Black Watch, Caledonian, and Jacobite.
Modern universal options include Scottish National, Brave Heart Warrior, Flower of Scotland and Pride of Scotland.

, Take a tape measure and measure the distance around both your hips and your waist. These measurements will determine how much material you need for the kilt.


For women, measure around the thinnest part of your waist and the widest part of your hips.
For men, measure around the upper edge of your hip bones and the widest part of your buttocks.
When taking measurements, make sure that the tape measure is taut and parallel to the ground.

, A traditional kilt length will equal the length between your waist to your mid-knee. Use a tape measure to calculate this distance.


If you plan to wear a wide kilt belt over your kilt, you should add 2 inches (5 cm) to this measurement for a high-rise waist.

, Since you need to form pleats out of your material, you will need a much greater length of material than the distance around your waist.


Measure the width of the ""sett"" or pattern on the plaid or tartan material. Each pleat will consist of a full sett with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of exposed pleat. In other words, if the setts on your material are 6 inches (15.25 cm) wide, each pleat will use 7 inches (17.75 cm).
Calculate the amount of material you need by multiplying half of your hip measurement by the amount of material needed for each pleat, and add this value to your full hip measurement. Add an additional 20 percent for additional pleating and centering to get your total number of inches needed. Divide this value by 72 to determine how many yards you need at double width., Pin the top and bottom edges of the material down, making sure that you fold on the outer edge of a sett on both ends. Sew the hems in place with a straight stitch or use an anti-fraying adhesive liquid on the edges.


This will not be necessary if the material has a finished edge at the top and bottom.

, The first pleat will help center the material, so it will end up being a little different from the other pleats.


Fold roughly 6 inches (15.25 cm) of material underneath itself at the right side of the material. Pin in place at the waist.
On the left side of the material, make a pleat that encompasses two setts. Secure with a safety pin at the waist.

, On a piece of cardboard or durable cardstock, mark the width of one sett. Divide this marked area into three to eight equal parts.


Use your best judgment to determine how many parts to divide the pattern into. The center section will peek through the pleat, so your center section should include an appealing part of the pattern.

, Lay your cardboard guide above each sett as you fold it. Overlay the folded edge of each pleat over the part of the pattern that matches it in the set next to it. Secure in place with a safety pin.


The cardboard guide should give you an idea of where to fold your first few pleats. After you begin folding, however, you may find that you do not need the guide since it should become a simple matter of matching the patterns together.

, Use a running stitch to catch the edge of each pleat, holding it in place at the bottom of the material.


You should do two rows of basting. The first running stitch should be about 1/4 of the length up from the bottom of the material, and the second should be about 1/2 of the length of from the bottom.

, Use an iron with a steam setting to press the pleats in place, making them more durable and helping the pleats keep their form. Iron along each folded edge of each pleat.


If your iron does not use steam, you can moisten a thin pressing cloth and place it over the pleats. Place this pressing cloth in between the iron and the material of your kilt and steam-press the pleats this way.

, Sew across the entire width of pleats and down each pleat along the fold.


Sew a straight stitch with your sewing machine across the top of your pleats, roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the upper edge.Sew a straight stitch with your sewing machine across the folded, ironed vertical edge of each pleat. Only sew about 4 inches (10 cm) of material. Do not sew all the way down each pleat.

, This pleating method can result in excess material, so you can trim this material off.


Cut away excess material from the section starting 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the hipline and ending at the waist. Do not cut away material from the first and last pleats.

, The material should be 5 inches (12.7 cm) wide and the length should match the length of the top edge of your kilt apron.


This should be just slightly longer than your initial waist measurement.

, Turn the bottom edge of the waistband material under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm). Sew this folded edge 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the top edge of the kilt apron, on the outside.


The remaining width of the waistband should be folded over the top of the kilt. You do not need to finish it since the lining will cover the raw edges.

, Cut 1 yard (91 cm) of duck cloth or canvas into 10-inch (25-cm) wide sections.

, The lining will be formed from three pieces of 10-inch (25-cm) wide strips.


Wrap the first section along the wearer's back.
Attach two additional sections to the first at the spots on the right and left where a side seam would usually appear.
Bring these two side sections together, bringing them around the front until each piece meets the side seam on the opposing side.
Pin everything in place.

, Align the top edge of the lining to the inside top of the waistband and sew in place.


Do an overlap stitch along the top inside of the apron to tack the lining to the kilt apron.
Only the top needs to be attached. You do not need to sew the bottom of the lining to the outer apron.
Note that the inside of the waistband will also be sewn under the lining, securing it in place.

, Fold the bottom edge of the lining under and sew a straight stitch along the material, hemming it in place. Do not sew it to the outer apron.


You could also use anti-fraying adhesive liquid if you do not want to stitch the hem closed.

, You will need two leather belts that are roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in width and long enough to wrap around your waist.


The first leather belt should go just below the waistband, on the underside of the kilt.
The second leather belt should go just above the bottom part of the sewn-down portion of your pleats. Again, it should be on the underside of the kilt.
Sew the belts in place. The leather portion of the belts should be attached to the lining while the buckle portions should be attached to the pleats.

, For additional support, sew a strip of Velcro onto the top of the apron.


One half of the Velcro should be sewn across the top right of the front flap while the other half should be sewn to the top wrong-side of the left.

, With this, your kilt should be complete. Wear it by wrapping the material around your waist and buckling the belts so that the material stays in place. Use the Velcro to add extra support so that your kilt stays firmly in place."

Buy plasticine or polymer clay and wire at your local craft store.,
Cut about a three foot piece of wire and bend it in half.,
Form the wire into the general shape of the object you wish to make.,
Start molding a thin layer of gray clay onto the armature or wire frame.,
Create a figurine for clay animation.,
Begin animating your figure.,
Place the figure on a flat surface.,
Move the figure very slightly into the next position, then take another picture.,
Continue to move the figure and take pictures until you have completed your desired animation.,
Load the pictures onto a computer.",How to Animate Clay," Any size wire will do. Make sure the clay will not harden when exposed to air. Purchase any color of clay you desire, but also purchase gray clay to use as a base.;
, Starting at the bent end, twist both strands of the wire together.

, Do not include fingers. This shape is called an armature, and it is the frame on which you will mold your clay. This will help support your clay figure when you begin to animate it.

, The gray clay acts as a neutral base on which you will later mold other colors of clay.

, Begin putting on the other layers of colored clay. For example, if you are creating a person from clay, then you mold different colors of clay onto the figure for things such as the shirt or pants. If you are creating a zebra, you may want to use black and white clay to make stripes.


If you cannot buy the color of clay that you desire for your figure, you can always make it by combining other colors. You can do this simply by kneading the different colors together.

, Set up a still digital camera at the angle in which you wish to capture the animation. A tripod is essential in this situation. For the animation to flow, it needs to all be captured from the same angle. Without a tripod, it isn't going to work.


You can also use a video camera for this step. To do this, press Record and then put the camera on Pause. Each time you want to shoot a frame, take the camera off of Pause and then quickly press Pause again. Note that this can reduce the image quality because of the constant starting and stopping.

, Carefully bend it into a starting position and take a picture of the figure with the camera.


Because you need to make sure that you only move the figure slightly between each shot, it is very helpful to mark the original spot of the figure in the first shot. That way, if you need to pick up the figure to adjust it, you can put it back in the same spot it was in. You can mark the spot with chalk, pencil, etc.

, Each picture is called a frame. Film runs at 24 frames per second, and digital video runs at 30. Be very precise while animating your figure. If you move it too much, it will appear to jump in the video. If you remove the figure from the camera's view, it will seem to disappear.


Be aware that the wire may poke through the clay when you move it, especially if the clay has become slightly rigid from sitting for a while. To soften the clay so that it does not rip, you can warm it up by holding it in your hands or putting it under a light.

, If you run out of pictures before you have finished, save the pictures to your computer and leave your figurine in the exact same position. Clear the camera and continue shooting.

, Use a photo editing program to speed up each individual picture so that it creates a movie. Watch your creation and show it to whoever you wish.


Keep in mind that clay animation is an extremely time- and labor-intensive process. Your animation may not come out perfectly the first time, but keep trying and it will get better.

Start with an unglazed, hard ceramic object.,
Wear disposable gloves while handling the ceramic object.,
Purchase pre-mixed glazes or ones mixed by a professional.,

Purchase an overglaze.,
Sand bumps or imperfections off the surface.,

Finish the underglaze process by applying an overglaze.,
Wipe off glaze from surfaces that will stick to the kiln.,
Search for a publicly accessible kiln.,
Seek experienced assistance if you need to purchase or operate your own kiln.,
Fire the glaze according to instructions.,
Retrieve your ceramic after several days, according to the studio's schedule.",How to Glaze Pottery," A ceramic shop or artist might direct you to suitable objects they sell. Typically, these objects have gone through a ""bisque"" firing process to make it hard. Unlike some types of fired ceramic, bisque has a porous, absorbent surface. This allows it to absorb wet glaze, which will then create a protective waterproof finish when the ceramic is fired a second time.


Depending on the type of clay used, the bisque ceramic piece may be white or red.
If you have a clay object you made yourself, fire it in the kiln to make it hard but still porous before you glaze. The exact temperature to fire your object depends on its size and type of clay, so check with the manufacturer of your clay, or if the manufacturer isn't available to you, ask the advice of an experienced potter. One may be willing to let you use his or her kiln to test the maturing temperature of your clay, although the potter may ask for compensation.;
, The plain ""bisque"" object you will be glazing should be kept as clean as possible. Even oil from your hands may prevent the glaze from attaching correctly, so wear disposable latex gloves whenever you touch the object you will be glazing.Change them whenever they get dirty, before touching the ceramic.

, While you may mix your own glazes out of dry powdered chemicals that contain silica, alumina, various ground elements, and water, doing so requires a respirator mask to avoid inhaling what is essentially particles of glass dust.Pre-mixed glazes are less likely to cause problems during firing as well, especially if you have never mixed your own glazes before.

, Different glazes require firing at different temperatures to set correctly onto the object. Do not use two glazes that require different firing temperatures on the same object, or you will risk breaking the pottery.


Firing temperatures may be listed simply as ""high"" or ""low"", or referred to as ""cone 04"", ""cone 6"", et cetera. These measurements refer to potters' cones made from different clay types, which sag at different temperatures in the kiln. If a clay is fired to the incorrect cone it may melt and ruin other artwork in the kiln.

, Ask what the glaze is made from before purchasing. Lead-based over-glaze are not recommended for objects that will come into contact with food or drink. Toxic glazes of any type are not recommended if children are involved in the glazing process or have access to the area you will be storing the glazes.

If you are working in a community studio, ask which glazes are considered food safe if your object will come into contact with food or drink.

Lead-based underglazes with a protective non-lead overglaze will probably be safe initially, if the glaze was fired properly. However, lead may begin to leach through the glaze after prolonged use, especially if the ceramic is frequently scrubbed or exposed to high-acid foods such as tomatoes. Stop using the dish immediately if you see powder or cracking at the glaze's surface.

, Overglaze creates a glossy, protective finish over the surface of the object. Pick a clear overglaze that won't hide the color of the underglaze(s), or if you aren't using underglazes, pick an overglaze of any color.


Note: As described above, you must use glazes that fire at the same temperature if you are using multiple glazes on one object. If you fire a glaze at the wrong temperature, your object could be damaged.

, If you notice any bumps on the object that aren't supposed to be there, you may sand them off using 100 grit sandpaper until you create a smooth surface.Be sure to wipe the object afterward with a damp sponge to remove dust created during sanding.


If you purchased an object intended for glazing, most if not all imperfections should be removed. When sanding a piece of bisqueware you will create dust which requires the use of a NIOSH approved particulate respirator. Use a wet sanding block or wet/dry sandpaper to avoid creating dust.

, Let it dry. Before you begin, and whenever the ceramic becomes dirty or you apply too much glaze, wipe with a damp sponge and let it dry before attempting to apply any glaze. Avoid rinsing or dripping excess water onto the ceramic. Use each side of the sponge sparingly to keep it as clean as possible; you may want to have several on hand.


Remember, you should reduce the amount of dirt or oil on the ceramic by wearing disposable gloves whenever you handle it.

, A coating of wax prevents glaze from sticking to the base of the ceramic, where it would ""glue"" your object to the base of the kiln. For the same reason, apply the wax to the rim where a lid touches, or anywhere else two distinct pieces will touch during firing. While some potters use slightly heated paraffin wax for this purpose, a safer and less smelly option is ""wax resist"" designed for this purpose at ceramic shops or some art supply stores. You may apply wax resist and apply it with a paint brush. Keep this brush separate from your glazes.Crayons may be rubbed on the object to create a wax coating, but there is a possibility that the colors in the crayon wax end up on your pottery.
If you are glazing pottery with children, you may find it easier to skip this step and hot glue the children's glazed objects to a clay disc immediately before firing, in order to catch dripping glaze., A pre-mixed glaze is recommended for your first few projects (at least) due to the safety hazard and difficulties involved in mixing your own glaze. If you do decide to mix a dry glaze powder with water, follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully or your glaze may not achieve the desired characteristics. Always wear a respirator mask to avoid inhaling dry glaze particles, and work outside or in a well-ventilated room. Do not let anyone near the work area without a respirator mask.Gloves and safety goggles are recommended.

Purchase the correct respirator and have yourself fit tested wearing that respirator. Many workplaces also recommended that you undergo a pulmonary fit test.

While full instructions are not included here due to the variations between different glaze mixes, you will need water, a long stirring spoon, and a hydrometer to test the density, or ""specific gravity"", of the glaze.It also helps to have a drill mixer (used for mixing paint), a rubber spatula, two containers (sized for the final quantity of glaze), a scale, and a fine mesh sieve 60-120 mesh, depending on your recipe.

, Even if you purchased pre-mixed glazes, they may require stirring to return them to an even consistency before you apply them. Follow the instructions on the packaging and stir until there is no sludge on the bottom or watery layer on top.You may want to deflocculate your glaze with epsom salt. This simple process will keep the sludge forming particles in suspension. Fill a small clear cup with 1/4 cup or 60ml of water per 5 gallon bucket of glaze, slowly sprinkle epsom salt into the water and stir, add the salt until it is saturated (when you have enough salt in the water it will no longer dissolve), when you see salt on the bottom of your cup you have reached the appropriate suspension. Add this liquid to your glaze and stir completely., Keep each color separate and use different brushes to avoid mixing them. Pour them into a small container rather than dipping the brush directly into the jar. This helps keep the remaining glaze clean for later projects.

, Decorate the object however you wish using brushes dipped in the underglazes. This is an open-ended process, and you may choose to get creative and drip, flick, or even spray the glaze on if you want a different effect than detailed brushwork. It is also completely acceptable to cover the entire surface with a single underglaze if you want a simple, solid color.


Keep in mind the final color of each glaze when you choose your design.
Intentional drips are often used to great effect by ceramic artists, but be aware that thick drips may alter the texture of the pottery and could cause improper firing.

, If you apply glaze in the wrong place, or if it begins to drip, scrape it off with a knife or other metal object. Wipe with a damp sponge afterward., If you are glazing a ceramic pot, mug, or other object with an inside surface, it may be difficult to see inside or reach in with the brush. Instead, you could pour a small amount of glaze inside and roll the object around in your gloved hands to apply it evenly., Before you attempt to apply a different color of underglaze, or the final overglaze finish, you must wait for your ceramic object to dry. This will happen faster if you keep it in an area with good air flow. Do not apply a new type of glaze until the old glaze no longer appears shiny and wet, and does not smudge when your brush touches it.

, If you have a pair of potter's tongs, the easiest way to accomplish this is to pick up the object with the tongs and dip it in a container holding the overglaze for one to three seconds. If you would like a thicker, glossier finish, dip the object for a shorter period of time, allow to dry fully, then dip again. You may dip several times, but the total application time of all dips should be no more than three seconds.You may also brush on the overglaze. Do this so the surface is completely covered with a thin layer. It is better to allow the ceramic to dry and apply a second thin layer than to apply too much glaze in one go.

, Also, wipe them from surfaces that will be in contact with other ceramic objects in the kiln, such as a lid. If you covered the base or other areas with wax or another resist, it will be easy to wipe off any glaze drips that would otherwise attach your object to the floor of the kiln. Use a clean, damp sponge.

If you did not use a resist, you may use an abrasive scrub pad (like those used to scrub dishes) to remove the excess glaze completely.

Wipe off glaze from these surfaces after each application of glaze, before it dries.
If your glaze seems runny or drips heavily, you may wish to leave the bottom 1/4inch (6mm) or more of the object's sides unglazed. Even many professional artists do this., Purchasing your own kiln can be expensive. If you live near an urban area, there are likely pottery studios that allow anyone to rent space in the kiln. Search online for kilns in your area, or for pottery studios that you could contact and offer to rent kiln space from.


If you live in the United States, this listing of kilns may be helpful, although there are many more not listed.

, If you end up needing to purchase a personal kiln, you'll probably want a more portable electric kiln. There are many factors to consider, including expense, wiring, and which additional tools to purchase. Kiln operation is complex and potentially dangerous, and you may wish to find an experienced potter to guide you through the first few times you use it.

, Glazes are either low temperature or high temperature, and firing them at the wrong setting may cause the ceramic to break or the glaze to fail to set. Make sure the kiln you are using is set to the correct ""cone"" as described on the glaze packaging.


If you are dropping off your ceramic object at a studio for the employees to fire later, include a note detailing the firing temperature. Do not attach this note directly to the glazed object.

, There are many different ways to operate a kiln, and some processes may require more time than others. Regardless, you should allow at least 24-48 hours for firing before your object is ready. If the kiln is used by many people, your object may not be ready for a week or two. Once it is done firing and has completely cooled, your object should be ready to take home and admire.


Note that your wax should burn off in the kiln. If there is any residue from your resist materials that means you used something that did not incinerate at 1000 degrees Fahrenheit, and you will need to find a different resist material next time.

Wipe off dust with a dry cloth.,
Use suction.,
Use forced air.",How to Clean Pottery1," Use a clean, lint-free dusting cloth. Rub it gently and carefully along the surface of the object. Move to an unsoiled area of the cloth when the fabric gets dirty.








Try a cotton cloth, or a fabric from nylon fibers made specifically for wiping away dust.;
, Place your object on a padded surface. Hold the nozzle of a vacuum about an inch away from the pottery. Apply suction as you brush the object’s surface with a soft paintbrush.








If possible, use a vacuum cleaner that has a high-efficiency particulate air filter (HEPA) and modifiable suction. Use less suction for tiny or very delicate items.

, Use a hairdryer on a low, cool setting. Rub a soft, lint-free cloth or a soft brush over your pottery as you blow it with air. Try a can of compressed air to get into crevices.

Know whether to slip the stitch knit-wise or purl-wise.,
Put your yarn in front, or keep it in back.",How to Slip Stitch1," You can slip a stitch knit-wise or purl-wise. (If no method is indicated, assume purl-wise.)

To slip a stitch knit-wise, insert the right needle into the next stitch from left to right, as if you were going to knit. Don't put the yarn over your needle, though; simply move the stitch from the left needle to the right needle. This method is more visible.
To slip a stitch purl-wise, insert the right needle into the next stitch from right to left, as if you were going to purl. Simply move the stitch from the left needle to the right needle. This method is nearly invisible.;
, Another variable to slipping stitches while knitting is whether your unknitted yarn stays in back (from where it is usually worked) or moves in front of the work. If you need to do a slip stitch ""wyif"" (with yarn in front), move the yarn such that it is between your needles and in front of the work. After the slip stitch, return it to the back position. If not otherwise noted, assume the slip stitch is ""wyib"" (with yarn in back)."

Practice on fabric scraps.,
Place the fabric in an embroidery hoop.,
Choose a narrow area.,
Stitch as close together as possible.,
Achieve even tension.,
Incorporate satin stitch in your design.",How to Satin Stitch1," Satin stitching by hand takes precision. Practice on spare fabric first so you get a sense for how tight to stitch, and how to keep the stitches as close as possible.


Start with a simple square or circle before trying intricate satin stitch patterns.;
, Always keep the area you're embroidering in a fabric hoop. This will keep the fabric tight and flat while you work.

, Only include satin stitches in narrow spaces, no more than ½ inch (1.25 cm) wide. Long satin stitches will float loose and look messy.

, You do not want any gaps between two stitches. Stitch as close as you can without tangling the threads, in tight parallel rows.

, Practice the satin stitch until you can pull the threads tight enough to lie flat, but loose enough that they don't distort the shape of the cloth. Stitching too tightly is a common mistake. Try to use a consistent tension for each stitch, or you'll have loose threads.

, Once you're confident with your scrap cloth, move on to a real project. Here are a few ideas:


Outline the edge of a garment.
Monogram a project.
Sew buttonholes with an extra-narrow satin stitch.
When you feel ready, try a whole art piece with satin stitches. Remember to stick to narrow stitches only.

Spot treat with alcohol.,
Remove adhesive marks.,
Treat silver marks.,
Clean mineral deposits.,
Treat darkened crazing.",How to Clean Pottery2," Wet a cotton cloth with rubbing alcohol. Alternately, dip the cloth in a solution of ten parts denatured alcohol, eight parts water (distilled or deionized) and one part non-detergent household ammonia. Wipe the wet cloth over stains, grease or dirt build-up.








Perform this step on stubborn stains before proceeding to soak the item in soap and water.
Ammonia can cause a chemical reaction to surfaces with unstable glazing. If in doubt, don’t use ammonia.
Make sure to wear gloves!

, Dampen a cloth with acetone, De-Solv-it spray, or Goo Gone. Rub the moistened cloth on any areas with glue or sticker marks. Follow this up by buffing with a soft cloth.








Make sure to wear gloves.
Don’t try this technique on any areas where your pottery has been repaired.

, Put a bit of metal polish, such as Noxon, on a rag. Rub the moistened rag on the markings. Apply significant pressure as you rub. Buff the pottery clean with a dry part of the rag.








Alternately, try using “Barkeeper’s Friend” with warm water and a sponge, or use a pencil eraser.

, Soak your pottery in white vinegar for at least a day or two. Rub the mineral buildup daily using a butter knife to gently break up buildup. Wash the pottery with soap and warm water once you’ve achieved clean pottery. Soak the pottery in tap water to get rid of the vinegar odor.








Try this for lime, calcium or rust stains.

, Wet clean rags with 40% hydrogen peroxide. Wrap your pottery with the rags. Place the wrapped pottery in a sealed bag. Re-soak the rags every few days.








The process is complete when the crazing has lightened to your satisfaction.

Examine the pottery closely.,
Seal up any air holes.,
Soak the pottery in soap and water.",How to Clean Pottery3," Hold a magnifying glass up to your pottery in natural daylight. Look for cracks, peeling glaze, and prior repairs. Don’t use a wet cleaning method if your pottery has any of these issues.Avoid wet cleaning if your pottery is hand painted.








Painted pottery may have been sealed with a spray glaze which is not tough like kiln-fired glazes.

, Plug the air hole in the bottom of a figurine, if applicable. Use a piece of tape if the object is unglazed. Otherwise, use a plastic bag or other waterproof object. Make sure that the ventilation hole is completely blocked off.








When you soak a figurine with air holes, you want to avoid getting water inside of the figurine. This can result in long-term structural damage to some ceramics.

, Line a sink or large container with at least one thick bath towel. Fill your container with warm water and add mild dishwashing detergent. Submerge your pottery for just a few seconds. Clean any problem areas with a soft washcloth.








Putting bath towels down can prevent your pottery from cracking if you accidentally drop it when your hands are soapy.

Using the end of the needle, grab a few threads of the fabric just above the fold.,
Put the needle back into the fold.,
Draw the needle back out of the fold.,Repeat Steps 2 through 4 as many times as needed.,
Tie off.",How to Slip Stitch3," Slip stitches are generally used to sew hems such that there is not a line of visible stitches on the outside (or inside) of the garment. Pin your hem first to ensure that you'll sew in a straight line. Your hem should have a ""fold"" inside of it; i.e., it should look something like you folded the bottom of the fabric up an inch or so, then folded that another inch (or whatever hem width you're using).,,, Don't put the needle all the way through the fabric and then bring it back, as you would in traditional sewing. Instead, guide the tip of the needle under three or four of the textile's threads. Weaving the stitch this way will prevent obvious bunching or pulling on the outside of the garment.

, Close to where you drew the needle out of the fold, point it back in, keeping the needle parallel to the fold. You'll be moving lengthwise along the fold as you continue.

, Again, grab a few threads of the fabric just above the point where the needle exited.

,, When you're finished sewing the hem, tie off such that the knot is located inside the fold.

Try your satin stitch settings on a scrap of the actual fabric, with the same actual thread you plan to use before you do the real deal.,
Set your machine to the shortest zig-zag.,
Attach a satin stitch foot to your machine.,
Draw a design onto the fabric (recommended).,
Stabilize the fabric.,
Stitch over the design.,
Seal satin-stitched edges.",How to Satin Stitch2," That way you can adjust the spacing between the stitches by experimentation before you end up with a giant clump of stitches that are too close together on your actual, precious project.

, Satin stitching is a zig zag stitch with the threads so close they touch each other. This is zig zag setting 1 on most machines.


You can change the width setting to any size that suits your design. Most satin stitches show up in buttonholes, outlines, and other narrow areas.
If you're not sure how to set your machine, look in the manual. You can find many sewing machine manuals online.

, A regular sewing machine foot will usually jam if you try to satin stitch with it. Buy a special satin stitch foot from any store that sells your brand of sewing machine. This foot has a groove on the underside so the stitch can pass through as you go.


A transparent foot makes it easier to see your design.
For intricate designs, you may use a free motion embroidery foot instead. This allows you to move the fabric in any direction while you stitch.

, For all but the simplest patterns, most embroiderers sketch their design onto the fabric. Use washable fabric pencil so you can remove the marks later.

, An embroidery hoop that attaches to your machine will keep the fabric taut for your stitch. If you are stitching an intricate pattern, you'll also need a stabilizer that adheres to the back of the fabric.


The choice of stabilizer depends on the fabric, thread, and type of project, so read the product description carefully before buying., Move slowly, especially if you're stitching an edge or outline. The stitches should be as even and close together as possible.


If your experimental satin stitch puckers, that means the tension is maladjusted. You can adjust upper and lower tensions ahead of time to prevent this.
Make sure the satin-stitches top-side and under-side are pretty much even in width. This is also a function of tension.
If adjusting the top tension doesn't even-out the top and bottom stitches, you can adjust bobbin tension by a tiny turn of the set screw on the bobbin case.

, If your piece has a satin-stitched outline, protect it with a fabric sealant such as Fray Check.


To further enhance the appearance, carefully trim the fabric just outside the satin stitches. Work with a magnifying glass to reduce the chance of cutting one of your stitches.

,
Finish the ends with pom-poms, tassels, or bows, tied or glued on.",How to Make an Eye of God," The sticks should be thin but strong, such as craft sticks or bamboo skewers.






;
, Using embroidery thread or yarn, tie a noose knot (slipknot) in the first yarn and tighten it around the intersection of the sticks. Wind the thread or yarn in a figure eight around the intersection (this technique works on bamboo skewers but not on craft sticks), or alternatively wind the thread or yarn several times, first from right to left diagonally, then from left to right. You want to cover the center of the sticks. Do not cut off the thread or yarn; you will continue weaving with it.








, Work counter-clockwise, moving the thread or yarn behind the top stick, back over the top stick, behind the left stick, over the left stick, behind the bottom stick, over the bottom stick, and behind and over the right stick to complete one round.








, Many Ojo de Dios are done completely in recessed rows, which show the shape of the sticks. However, you can alternate recessed and raised rows. To do this, you need to reverse direction. Basically, you reverse, and turn the work over, so that you're working on the back. This creates a raised row on the front.








, This way, the knot forms on the back of the sticks. Do not clip off the old color until you've worked over it for a few rows and you're confident that the knot is secure enough.








,, Wrap the final thread or yarn all the way down the handle and knot the ends to keep in place.

This material is loosely woven in a grid pattern that makes lining up all your stitches easy. Aida fabric comes in different sizes which refer to the number of stitches that can be created in 1 square inch. The options are typically 11, 14, 18, and 28.


It is easiest to start on an Aida cloth that uses an 11 or 14 stitch count, as this provides larger spaces for your cross stitch. The higher the number of stitches, the smaller your crosses will be.
If you don't want to use Aida cloth for your cross stitch, other popular options are linen or fiddlers cloth. Both these lack the same wide spaces Aida cloth provides for beginners though.;
, Cross stitch is great because it offers so much freedom on the part of the maker, particularly in the color options of thread. Embroidery floss is typically used and can be found in hundreds of colors.


Each skein of embroidery floss comes in six threads, but only 1-3 will be used for cross stitch at a time.
Embroidery floss comes in both matte colors as well as iridescent and metallic. The latter two are a bit more difficult to work with and cost several times more than the former.
If you have a difficult time doing cross stitch with your thread, you can get waxed thread or use a bit of beeswax to prep your thread before starting your stitching. It will help the floss to thread and tie off easier., Cross stitching is as simple as matching the grid on a pattern of choice to the grid in your cross-stitch fabric. Choose a pattern from a booklet or online, and gather embroidery floss in colors to match.


As a beginner, it may be best to start with a simple cross stitch. Find a pattern that is small and doesn’t involve too many details and uses a total of 3-7 colors only.
You can create your own pattern using your own images and a computer program or a bit of graph paper if you don't like the patterns that are available.

, This is a double ring made of plastic, metal, or wood that secures your cross stitch as you work. Although you can create a cross stitch without one, embroidery hoops are incredibly helpful and relatively inexpensive. Small hoops are easier to hold but must be moved often, while large hoops require more of a grip but need to be moved around your needlepoint less.

, Any image can be created into a cross stitch pattern, but simple ones with easily definable shapes are best. Choose a picture or drawing that has only a few colors and lacks a lot of detail.

, You may want to crop and enlarge your image so that you focus on only a single portion of the original picture. If you have a photo editing program, use a ""posterize"" feature to transform your picture into easily definable shapes. Convert your picture to grayscale before printing so that choosing colors to match the values is easier.

, Print a physical copy of your image and gather a piece of graph paper. Lay the graph paper over the top of your printed image and trace the outline of the most basic shapes. Try to limit the amount of detail that you copy over.

, With your image and shapes traced, choose 3-7 colors to use for your cross stitch. Use colored pencils that match your chosen colors to shade in the shapes, focusing on a grid pattern and avoiding curved lines., If drawing your own pattern by hand isn't your deal, try using an easy computer program to convert your favorite image to a cross stitch pattern. Programs such as ""Pic 2 Pat"" allow you to choose the size of the pattern, number of colors, and amount of detail included in your finished pattern., The size of your fabric will depend on the size of the pattern you are using. Each small square on the cross stitch fabric is representational of a single stitch (or ‘x’ shaped cross), and can be counted across to get your exact size. Your embroidery floss should be cut to a length of about 36” to begin.


Embroidery floss comes in strands of six threads, but typically only one is necessary for cross stitching. Gently pull apart the groupings of threads from the center and use a single thread for each section on your pattern.
Some patterns may call for multiple threads to be used at once, so make sure to check yours before assuming the use of a single thread.
If you run out of thread for your pattern, don’t fear! One of the great things about cross stitching is that you can’t tell where you start/stop from the front. Simply cut additional thread and start again from where you left off.

, Take your single thread of embroidery floss and create a loop at the end. Wet the center of this loop (by licking it or using a drop of water) to make threading it easier. Then pull the loop through, leaving the two tail ends (one should be very short) to hang out the opposite side of the eye of the needle.

, Count on your pattern the number of grid spaces to the first stitch (typically the centermost stitch), and insert your needle from the bottom. Pull the thread all the way through, leaving a bit of the loop at the bottom. Then, cross the thread down or up diagonally and pull the needle through the loop underneath to create a stable anchor for your stitching.


It doesn’t matter if you start your cross stitch going ‘////’ or ‘\\\\’ as long as you are consistent with this pattern over the entirety of your project.
With every stitch you make, thread your strings over the loose tail in the back to secure it to your cross stitch fabric. This will also make it less likely for your cross stitch to unravel from being tugged or pulled., Using the same ‘x’ stitch pattern, work outwards from the center of your cross stitch until you have completed the pattern. If you run out of thread at any point, tie the floss off in a knot at the back and cut a new piece.

, When you have completed the pattern and added an optional backstitch border, tie off your thread underneath your cross stitch. Tie a simple knot on the backside of your pattern, and cut off any remaining thread., Hands are naturally very dirty and oily, and as such make the fabric of your needlepoint dirty as well. Frequent hand washing cans help to limit the amount of grime that is transferred to your fabric, but a ring of dirt around your embroidery hoop is nearly inevitable. Gently hand wash your cross stitch with soap and water and allow to air dry when you are finished with it.

, Quarter stitches are, as they sound, 1/4 of a completed 'X' shape in a cross stitch. These can be used to add subtly curved lines and lots of detail. To Create a 1/4 stitch, bring your needle from the corner of one of the boxes through the center of the box. This should create a single leg of the ""X"" shape.

, This stitch is another commonly used stitch for creating detail in your pattern. It is made by doing a half stitch (a complete diagonal stitch) and a quarter stitch. The appearance is of an ""X"" with only three legs instead of four.

, To create a solid border around your cross stitched figures, use a single strand of embroidery floss (black is usually used) and back stitch around the outline of your pattern. To create a back stitch, work vertically and horizontally (rather than creating ‘/’ or ‘\’ shaped stitches, form ‘|’ or ‘_’ shaped stitches) around your figure. Pull the needle up at the top of a box, and then back through at the bottom, repeating this pattern until you have completed the border.

, Although this is not a traditional cross stitch, it can be used to create small dots or spots on your needle point. To create a French knot, pull your thread up through your fabric. Wrap your needle around the thread 2-3 times near the base of the entrance of the thread. Insert the needle back down into the fabric near the origin, holding the thread taut as you do so. Pull the needle all the way through to complete the French knot."

",How to Make a Tire Tread Belt," Check out various bicycle repair and sales stores; look for tires with regular, even treads that are not too worn. Tires that have a simple tread design (for example, not a bumpy tire) will slide through belt loops more easily.;
, Look in belt stores, flea markets, or recycle an old belt that you presently own. Find belt buckles of any type and shape and color that would fit your look.

, These are sometimes called ""sex bolts"" and can be found at hardware stores, specialty paper stores (people use them to tie folios together), or a saddlery.

, The edges will curve too much to be useful.

, Cut from the inside side of the tire (closest to the fabric threads in the tire), as this will give a cleaner cut, as illustrated.

, Ensure that the bolt is close to the buckle when you join the ends together, this will prevent the buckle from moving sideways.

Get your supplies together.,
Cut a strip of brown construction paper.,
Decorate the band.,
Glue the ends together.,
Pick paper for feathers.,
Cut out each feather.,
Fold and slit the feathers.,
Glue your feathers to the band.,
Wear the headband at home.",How to Make an Indian Headdress1," You will need scissors, a tape measure, a ruler, brown construction paper, crayons or paint, craft or hot glue, and either feathers (as many as you like) or more colors of construction paper. If you are making paper feathers, you will be able to get up to one feather for every inch your construction paper is wide. However, you may wish to buy several colors of construction paper, and cut one or two feathers from each.;
, The strip should be about 1½ inches (3.8 cm) in width. It should also be long enough to wrap around the wearer's head with a little extra overlap space.


Add roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) extra to the length. This overlap length will allow you to glue the ends together securely in order to form a band later on.
Feather headbands were worn by a few tribes of the northeast Woodland, such as the Lenape and Abenaki. They were worn by men and women alike, and were not associated with battle.
Pick a sturdy brown paper so it looks like leather. Pick another color if you would rather have a different color band. Actual feathered headbands were typically woven or beaded, so feel free to use an alternative color for your band.
Alternatively, beaded turbans became popular among Cherokee, Seminoles and other southeastern Indian men when cloth became easily available in the 1800s, so consider wrapping a turban and tucking a feather into it.You can print and use this template instead.




Indian Headdress Template






, Use markers, crayons, paint, or colored pencils to create a colorful design, perhaps inspired by a tribe such as the Wampanoag, Lenape, and Abenaki. You can find patterns online, or in books about Woodland Indian tribal patterns.


Purple and white beads were favored by tribespeople in the Northeast, such as the Wampanoag.Draw a geometrical pattern along the band. For instance, draw a series of triangles within triangles of alternating colors. Draw the lines along a ruler to make them straight.
If you want your band to appear beaded, you can paint dabs of color.
If making an art project with a child, give your child a ruler and a limited color palette (2-4 crayons, for instance) and explain that the pattern should be the same all around.

, Apply a dot of craft glue on one end of the band, on the decorated side. Wrap the strip into a band and press the end of the other side on top of the glue. Let dry.


There should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlapping paper.
If craft glue will not hold the paper headband together, use a glue stick or a stronger type of glue, such as hot glue.
If you are using real or craft feathers, you can glue them on at this time. Put a few dots of glue on the inside of the band, and arrange one or more feathers so that they stand up. If you have multiple feathers, arrange them so they fan out slightly from one another.

, If you do not have real feathers or craft feathers, you can make your own by cutting fringes into colorful ovals of construction paper. Any color and number of feathers will do. You might choose red, yellow, and orange, or use colors that you used when decorating the brown band.

, Draw a narrow oval on your first piece of construction paper. The oval should be at least 6 inches (15 cm) long by 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Cut the oval out.

, Fold the oval in half lengthwise. Cut slits along the open, curved edge. Make sure that the slits do not cross each other or cut through the straight, folded edge. The slits should extend from top to bottom.


Folding the feathers creates the feather's shaft. Don't worry about the fold being perfectly centered, as feathers are not always symmetrical.
Unfold the paper feather. Repeat with other colors of construction paper.

, Glue your paper or craft feathers to the inside of your headband and let dry. The feathers should all extend up and out from the band at a single point. One feather can stand straight up, but the other two should fan out slightly.

, When wearing the headband, position it so that the feathers are behind the wearer's ear on one side of his or her head. Incorporate this costume choice with a lesson on the tribe whose designs you are borrowing.


Most native people consider ""Indian costumes"" offensive. Please avoid dressing as any racial stereotype for Halloween.Understand that you will seriously offend the people whose culture you are borrowing from if you paint your skin, or sexualize minority groups whose oppression includes a long history of sexual violence.If you must dress as someone from another race, dress as a specific person. Take the time to research and dress as the historical Pocahontas, not the Disney character.

Gather supplies.,
Cut a strip of corrugated fiberboard.,
Stick feathers into the holes of the cardboard.,
Overlap the ends of the headband.,
Cover the outside.,
Frill the edges of the crepe paper.,
Design an alternative warbonnet.",How to Make an Indian Headdress2," You will need scissors, a tape measure, a hole puncher, a 2-prong paper fastener, and craft glue or hot glue. You will also need corrugated fiberboard, crepe paper, and craft feathers or paper to make paper feathers.

, The strip should be 1 1/2 inches (3.8 cm) wide and 2 inches (5 cm) longer than the length required to fit around the intended wearer's head.


Corrugated fiberboard, also called corrugated cardboard or corrugated paper, has narrow ridges or holes along the inside, making it a little lighter than standard cardboard but also a little thicker.
Choose a thin piece of corrugated fiberboard to make it easier to wrap it around into a band-like form.
These instructions will allow you to create a ""straight-up"" style warbonnet, in which the feathers extend vertically from the headband.

, Apply a small dot of glue to the top of each corrugated hole, inside the hole itself. Attach the stem of a craft feather to each dot of glue and let dry.


To make it easier for the feathers to stick to the glue, you may want to keep the cardboard flat, attaching the feathers horizontally rather than vertically.
Use craft glue or hot glue to hold the feathers in place.

, Fold the headband over so that the extra 2 inches (5 cm) of length overlap. Use a hole puncher to punch a hole in each end and slip a 2-pronged paper fastener through these holes.


Spread the prongs out to hold the band in place.
For extra security, punch two holes in each end, one near the top and one near the bottom, and use two 2-pronged fasteners to hold the band together.

, You may use cloth, beads, or bright red crepe paper. The paper strip should be 2 inches (5 cm) wide and 1 foot (30.5 cm) longer than the length of the band.


Center and paste the crepe paper strip over the band of fiberboard. There should be about 1/4-inch (0.635 cm) hanging off the top and bottom of the band and 6 inches (15 cm) hanging down from both ends.

, If using crepe paper to cover, frill the edges. Use scissors to cut 1/4-inch (0.635-cm) fringes along the top and bottom of the crepe paper.


This completes your headdress. When wearing the headdress, the feathers should stand upright over the head.

, There isn't one single style of warbonnet, so look through pictures of trailer warbonnets, halo warbonnets, and straight-up warbonnets for design ideas. About a dozen tribes, all in the Great Plains region, wore bonnets to reward bravery and great deeds. Tribes that used warbonnets include the Sioux, Crow, Blackfeet, Cheyenne, and Plains Cree.


A warbonnet is a sacred symbol that honors great deeds. They are not worn by most tribe members. Modern-day American Indians might earn a warbonnet for advocacy or scholarship.
You are likely to offend people if you wear a warbonnet as a costume.

Obtain supplies.,
Design your headband.,
Thread your loom.,
Thread the beads on a long string.,
Weave your headband.,
Tie it off.",How to Make an Indian Headdress3," You will need beads, beading string, and a beading needle. You will also need a beading loom. If you have a beading loom and beading kit, go for larger seed beads and one large toggle bead to finish. If you are starting from scratch, buy a small bag of beads in the colors you want to use. The beads should all be the same size, though you may buy one larger one to seal the headband if you want.


Build a loom. You can make a beading loom by attaching two combs to a sturdy box or box lid. Take two matching combs, or snap a single comb in half. Tape or glue each comb to parallel sides of the box, each at the edge, so that the teeth protrude into the air.
Buy string for beading. A slightly elastic string will make your headband more comfortable.

, Beaded headbands were worn by members of many tribes, including those of the Cheyenne, Sioux, Crow, Sauk, Fox, Winnebago, Kickapoo, Cree, and Arapaho. Search online for patterns traditional to these tribes, or find one in a book about North American beadwork. You can also invent your own design. Draw your design on graph paper, coloring in the squares to represent the beads you will use.


You run less risk of offending a native person if you opt for a beaded headband, as they hold less spiritual significance than feathered warbonnets or headdresses., Tie beading string to the leftmost tooth of the loom (or comb), then stretch taut across the loom and cut it to size, leaving two or three inches of string hanging loose outside the loom. Tie the loose end to the leftmost tooth of the other side of the loom. Repeat until you have enough parallel strings to contain your design.

, Arrange your pattern to match your loom, in a vertical line, and start counting beads from the top row. Count out the first 5 lines of your pattern and thread the corresponding beads onto a long thread in the order you have counted. Count from left to right for the first row, then right to left for the second, then left to right, etc.


This is because you will be weaving the beaded string through the strings on the loom from left to right, then right to left, switching each time a row ends.

, Tie the end of the string to a needle, and weave in and out of the rows. Go over the first string, under the next, then over, then under. Weave your first row at the loom's top, weaving left to right. You'll end up on the right: start the same process again from the right, then back again from the left. Stop after your first five rows to see if the pattern is coming out as you'd planned.


If it is, line up your next 5 rows on the string and keep weaving.
If it isn't, undo your glitchy rows and count your beads again.

, Use a tape measure to measure the head of the person who will wear the headband. Weave until you have reached that length, or an inch shorter if you want to tie off the ends. Cut your headband free, and tie the two or three inches of thread you left hanging together so that the beads stay in place. You may tie a large bead to one side, and make a loop with the other, large enough to go around the bead.


Trim for tidiness.
If you don't want to use the large bead method, you can tie the dangling thread on each side in a knot. Tie the two knotted ends together when you want to wear your band.
If your band fits exactly, you can tie the ends together tightly and wear it as is.

Full grain leather belt blanks are generally inexpensive, costing around $13 dollars. You can buy a leather belt blank online from Ebay or you can go to a leather store like Tandy’s.


Make sure the leather strap is the right width, for a man, you will usually want a belt 1 ½ inches in width. If you are a woman, you usually want to buy one that is 1 ¼ inches width. You can also buy embossed belt blanks to give your belt a little more style. ;
, You can buy silver or gold roller belt buckles from department stores like Walmart or Target. You can buy roller buckles and a variety of big belt buckles from Western stores.

, A belt keep is a little leather strip that holds the overlapping belt strap. Find one that is the same width/color as your belt blank. This should only be about a dollar. When you go to buy your belt buckle, ask about a belt keep.

, Because the leather that you are buying is untreated, you will need to preserve it by conditioning the leather with a balm. You can also use a water based leather dye to preserve your leather instead if you would like.


If you do not condition or dye your leather and water gets on your leather blank, your leather will stain forever.

, On the side with the holes, insert the middle pin of the buckle through the hole and fold the leather strap down. Then snap the snaps into place to secure your strap.

, Put on your belt and cinch it to a place where it is comfortable. Mark on the inside of the belt with a sharpie where you will punch a hole.

, If you don’t have a leather hole punch you can very carefully use a power drill to make your hole(s). You can also add more holes and space them about an 1 inch apart.

, Once your belt is back on, you should see how much you want your belt strap to overlap in the front. Use a sharpie to mark the place on the inside of your belt.

, Where you marked with your sharpie, you should shape an end. You can use a gatorade cap to make a half circle shape on the strap. With an Xacto knife, carefully cut out the shape in the leather.

, Using a soft cloth like a t-shirt, rub leather balm into your strap. Apply the balm liberally but evenly to the belt so that the color is consistent. You should use the balm on both sides of your strap. The balm will make the leather a little bit darker. Let the leather dry completely.


If you are going to dye your leather, now is the time to do so.

Insert the belt buckle through the unclosed end of the belt strap.",How to Make a Belt2," Choose a fabric you want to make a belt out of. Get a plastic belt buckle to go along with the fabric. You should buy a plastic belt buckle that doesn’t have a tongue. You can find these belt buckles at craft stores, or you can buy them online at Etsy where there is a variety of stylish belt buckles., Depending on where you want to wear your belt, measure around your body. Use a measuring tape, and have a pencil and pen out to write down the measurement. You will add 6 inches to account for sewing on the belt buckle and the overlap of the belt.

, The inside width of your belt buckle will determine how wide your belt is. Write down the measurement.

, Cut three strips, two of the strips should be fabric and one is the interfacing. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut your fabric.


Interfacing is a stiff fabric that is used to reinforce fabric, think of the material in the shirt collar that makes it stiff., The first layer should be print side facing up. The second layer should be print side facing down and the third layer should be the interfacing. The interfacing should be on the top. Use straight pins, and pin together the fabric down each of the long sides of the interfacing.

, Lay your belt buckle over the strips to see how wide you need your strap. Use a pencil and measuring tape, and mark the width you want. Then draw straight lines down the length of the fabric to the correct width. These lines will help you sew a straight line and should ensure that you are making a strap that is the right width. Typically, you will stitch about a ⅕ of an inch away from the sides.

, Use a sewing machine and removing the pins as you stitch, sew down each side of the fabric following the stitching line. Do not sew the ends of the fabric yet.

, First, lay your belt buckle back on the fabric to verify it is the right width. Then on both sides of the stitching, you should trim away the excess fabric.


If the stitching is too wide for the belt buckle, go over the fabric again with your sewing machine to make the strap the correct width.

, Hook a safety pin (the bigger the better) to one end of your fabric strap. Push the safety pin through the tube to the other side. You will have to bunch the fabric as you go to get it through.

, Using the cotton setting, iron down the length of your belt. Iron so that the belt is as wide as possible.

, Fold a small amount of the fabric in the tube. Using your sewing machine, sew over the end to neatly sew the bottom of your belt closed. Trim off any excess threads.

, Fold an inch or so of the fabric over the belt buckle, and then stitch it closed to secure the buckle in place. You can sew this fold in place by hand as most sewing machines probably won’t be able to fit between the buckle and the place you are sewing.


Sew the fold so that the edge will be hidden by your belt buckle.

Add a belt tip to your cotton webbing belt.",How to Make a Belt3," This method contains 3 different ways to make a ribbon or cotton webbing belt. Depending on how thick you want your belt and what style of belt you want to wear, find a material that is right for you. There are great materials for belts including Jacquard ribbon, velvet ribbon and cotton webbing. All of these can be found at craft stores or online. Follow the inline citations with the descriptions below for more information. As you follow the steps, skip to the ones that apply to your chosen option.


Jacquard ribbon is a patterned ribbon that was historically woven using a loom. With Jacquard ribbon you have a wide variety of patterns to choose from. Making a belt out of Jacquard ribbon usually requires a sewing machine to make. Buy at least 2 ½ yards in length (depending on your size) because you will need to double the measurement for the belt.Velvet ribbon belts can be great to wear with winter clothes. This is the simplest belt to make and only require iron-on tape and D hooks. Buy at least 2 ½ yards in length (depending on your size) because you will need to double the measurement for the belt.Cotton, acrylic or polyester webbing for your strap are great durable belts that look good with jeans or cinching tops. You should buy a strap 1 ¼- 1 ½ inches wide and 2 to 3 mm thick. You can also decorate the strap with lace if you would like., Make sure to buy D rings that are slightly wider than the width of your fabric. At a craft store, you will find these rings in silver or gold, typically, and you may also find plastic D rings as well.

, How you position the D ring depends on what material you are making your belt out of:


For Jacquard ribbon, slip your D rings into one side of the ribbon, and fold the ribbon in half. Make sure your ribbon is pattern side out. Your D rings should be at one folded end.
For velvet ribbon, slip the two D rings in one side of the ribbon. Fold the two sides of the ribbon into the middle so they meet. The fuzzy side of the ribbon should be facing out, and the D rings should be at one folded end of the ribbon.
For cotton webbing, at one end of the cotton webbing, slip the two D rings and fold the cotton webbing over. The cotton webbing doesn’t have to overlap a lot, maybe an inch over itself. Then sew the fold shut with a sewing machine or a strong needle. If you want to add a lace decoration to your belt, do not sew the end of the D rings yet.

, The ribbon is folded in half so that it is two strips. Use a sewing machine to sew the two strips together. Sew very close to the edge. Starting near the D rings at one folded end of your ribbon, sew and backstitch near the D rings. Then continue sewing down the length of the strip. Back stitch when you get to the end of the strip.

, When you get to the cut end of your ribbon, fold the cut edges over twice in small folds. Pivot and sew down the folds to close the end shut. Then pivot again to sew up the other side of the ribbon.

, After you pivot, sew a couple of inches and then do a back stitch. Continue sewing up the other long side of the ribbon. When you get to the D rings, do a back stitch to finish sewing your ribbons together. You are done!

, Cut off 1 ¼ yard (or the length of your ribbon when folded in half) of your iron-on tape. Peel off the backing, and sandwich between the two layers of velvet ribbon.

, Place scrap velvet on top of the belt to protect the velvet. Then set your iron on the cotton setting, and iron over the belt to fuse the two sides of the ribbons together. You are done!

, Place a piece of lace down the center of your cotton webbing, and using your sewing machine, sew down both sides of the lace to secure it to your belt. Use a wide zigzag stitch.


Cut off excess lace. Trim any lace threads on the belt as well.
Sew your D hooks into place now. Fold one end of the belt over the two D hooks so that the fold encases the hooks and overlaps a little. Sew the fold into place using a sewing machine or a strong needle.

, These tips should match the width of your cotton webbing (usually 1 ¼ -1 ½ inches). They can be found at craft stores. Belt tips have teeth at the bottom that will sink into the belt. Using a hammer, put the belt tip at the end of your belt, and then hammer it into place. Hammer enough so that the teeth go all the way in.


Your belt tip should go in fairly easily. You don’t need to use much force when hammering the belt tip in place.

You might opt for all antique or vintage pieces, or go for an edgier look with studded or spiked items. Select pieces that all have a similar aesthetic so they look like they belong together.The easiest style to start with when you’re layering jewelry is minimal pieces. Choose necklaces with small, delicate pendants, fine chain bracelets, or rings with thin bands.
If you really want to make a bold statement with your layered jewelry, you can pair contrasting styles. For example, you might layer an antique ring with a studded modern style. Keep in mind, though, that it's a more dramatic, risky look so it's best for an evening out rather than a casual, everyday occasion.;
, If you’re new to layering jewelry, you’ll have an easier time if you select pieces that all share a common element or theme in addition to a similar style. Choose pieces that are all made of the same metal or material, or go with pieces that all feature the same type of gemstone. Pieces that all have the same shape charms can also work.The easiest way to find a common theme is to stick to jewelry that’s all the same metal or material. For example, choose all gold necklaces or all silver rings.
If you want to mix metals or materials, select items that all feature the same gemstones. For example, you might choose gold and silver necklaces that all have pearl details.
Utilizing a similar shape can also help when you’re mixing metals. For example, you might mix gold and rose gold rings that all feature heart-shaped designs.

, While you want to choose jewelry that has a similar style and some type of common theme for layering, you don’t necessarily want all of the pieces to look the same. To add some variety to your look, use items that have different weights, such as pairing skinny rope chains with chunkier beads.For example, you might pair a thin gold chain with a small pearl pendant with a strand of large chunky pearls.

, When layering jewelry, you want to focus the attention in one area or you may wind up with an overdone look. If you’re wearing several necklaces, opt for a single bracelet and simple ring. If you’re wearing a stack of bracelets, choose a delicate chain necklace. That will give you a more balanced look.If you’re headed out for the evening or a special occasion, you may want to make a bolder statement and layer your jewelry in more than one area, such as wearing multiple necklaces and stacked bracelets. It’s still best to keep the rest of your accessories minimal, though.

, The key to layering necklaces is choosing pieces that vary in length so you can stagger them. It’s usually best to start with a choker or 16-inch (41-cm) necklace that will fall high on your neckline and go down a couple of inches (5-cm) with each additional necklace.Not only does varying the length of your necklaces allow each to stand out, it helps prevent them from becoming tangled while you’re wearing them.

, If you are wearing necklaces that are similar in length, make them stand out from one another by playing with the placement of their pendants or central charms. For example, you might leave one in the center, slide another to rest a few inches (7.5-cm) to the right or left of center, and move another to sit on one side of your collarbone.Your necklaces may get slightly tangled if you wear them in this way. Don’t worry about it -- it can actually add to the look.

, You can create a bold look by layering several heavy, chunky statement necklaces that rest almost on top of one another. It will give you collar-like effect that helps draw attention to your face.For example, you might layer a chunky gold chain necklace, a colorful enamel necklace, and boldly shaped gold statement necklace that are all about 16- to 18-inches (41- to 46-cm) long.
To keep the look from appearing too heavy, don’t use more than two or three statement necklaces to create the collar effect.
This is an ideal way to layer necklaces over a collared shirt, but you can also do it with a high neck, boatneck, or scoop neck top.

, If you’re new to layering bracelets, it’s best to keep things simple. Instead of wearing multiple bracelets on both wrists, limit your layering to one wrist. You can wear as many bracelets as you’d like on that wrist if you leave your other one bare.If you don’t want to leave your other wrist completely bare, stick to one simple, delicate bracelet. That will keep you from looking overloaded.

, To make sure that your layered bracelets stand out and add to your outfit, it helps to vary the thicknesses and shapes of your bracelets. Layer some thin chain bracelets with a chunky bangle, or pair a couple of round bracelets with a square style.If you prefer wear bracelets that are similar in width and shape, you can add visual interest to the look by mixing materials, such as metal and beads, for added texture.

, When you’re layering bracelets, there’s no reason why you can’t incorporate your favorite watch. As with any type of jewelry, though, make sure that your watch shares some common element with the bracelets.For example, if you’re wearing gold and silver bracelets, choose a watch that’s gold, silver, or features elements of both.
If your watch doesn’t have a metal band, try to match the color of the leather or other material to the bracelet’s details.

, While layering your rings means that you can wear multiple pieces on a single finger, you can maximize the impact by spreading them out across more than one finger. For example, you might wear a single ring on your index finger, three or four on your middle finger, and two on your ring finger. You can also wear rings on both hands to really make a statement.To highlight a specific stack of rings, you may want to leave the finger next to it bare.
When you’re deciding how to spread out your rings, consider wearing a pinky and/or thumb ring to add even more personality to your look.

, Your layered rings will look less styled if you adjust the placement. Instead of wearing all of them at the base of your finger, vary them. Place some rings closer to the end of your finger, some in the middle, and some at the base so your look has a more eclectic feel.You don’t want your rings to fall off or feel uncomfortable, so be sure that they fit the area of the finger where you plan to wear them.

, Just as with bracelets, your look will have more personality if you vary the size and shape of your rings. By combining thin and chunky styles and simple round bands with designs that run vertical or horizontal, your layered rings will draw more attention.For example, you might wear a couple of thin, delicate bands on your index finger, a single oversized cocktail ring on your middle finger, and three or four styles with small stones in the center on your ring finger.

Remove any embellishments on the tiara.,
Wrap metallic pipes cleaners around the tiara to completely cover it.,

Finish off with the details.",How to Make a Mermaid Crown," Do you want a large, fancy crown or a simple tiara? Do you want it to look natural or fantasy-like? Take a look at the different types of shells, and see how they could be put together to form a crown. For example, pointy turret shells that look like unicorn horns would make great points for your crown. Starfish, sand dollars, or scalloped shells could make pretty centerpieces.
, Try to get an assortment of shells, such as: scalloped/fan shaped shells, pointy ""unicorn horn"" turret shells, conch shells, and snail/cat's eye shells. You can also get some sand dollars or a star fish for the center.It would also be a good idea to buy some embellishments and fillers, such as: pearl beads, glass beads, sea glass, and tiny rhinestones. You can use these to fill in any gaps.

You don't have to head out to the beach to get shells. You can buy bags of them from the craft store.

, You can paint all of the shells the same color, or you can use different colors. Purple and teal are great options, but you can use other colors too, such as pearl, pink, or gold.You can also skip painting the shells if you want a natural-looking crown.

You may need to apply several coats of paint. Allow each coat to dry first before you do, however.
If you want something more natural, but still shimmery, paint your shells with a single, light coat of pearl-colored paint.

, Paint your shells decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge), then sprinkle extra-fine scrapbooking glitter over them. Tap off any excess glitter. For something more subtle, outline the shells' edges, ridges, and grooves with liquid glue, then add the glitter.Use a glitter color that matches the shell to prevent any clashing. Iridescent is also a good option.
You don't have to add glitter to all of your shells. You can leave some un-glittered.

, Tiaras made out of hard, study plastic work great. You can also use a metal one as well. Avoid tiaras made from cheap, flimsy, or brittle plastic, as they may not hold up well to the weight of the shells.Make sure that the tiara has combs at the end. This will help anchor the crown when you wear it.

, If the tiara has any clunky rhinestones or fuzzy boas, you will need to remove those first.If the tiara has any protruding pieces that you feel will interfere with your final design, cut them off with a craft blade; you can also try carefully breaking them off instead.

If you have a metal tiara, you can try cutting parts off with wire cutters.
If you really like a certain embellishment, save it so that you can glue it on later.

, This will give the shells something to stick to. If your tiara has lots of curly designs, be sure to wrap the pipe cleaners around each individual design. You will end up with a tiara that looks like it's made out of pipe cleaners.Don't use the standard fuzzy pipe cleaners.

Use colors that match your shell colors. If you have lots of warm colors, use gold. If you have lots of cool colors, try silver, blue, or green.
For a more natural looking crown, use jute cord instead. Secure both ends with hot glue.Another option would be to use thin, satin ribbon. Choose a color that works with your design, and secure both ends with glue.

, Choose a large, scalloped shell, starfish, or sand dollar as your focal point. Glue it down in the center of the crown with hot glue or industrial strength glue., Pick out your pointy shells, and glue then along the edges of your crown. Make sure that the opening of the shell is facing the tiara's band; this way, the hole won't be visible in the end. For a more interesting effect, glue the taller shells towards the center of the tiara, and the shorter ones towards the ends.You can add as many spikes as you want. You can have them go from the focal point all the way to the combs, or you can have just a few on each side.
For a more interesting look, alternate between turret and conch shells.

, At this point, the base of your crown is done. You can make it look more interesting by adding more layers. For example, you could glue some clam or snail shells along the base of your crown. A smaller clam shell to either side of your focal point would also look pretty.

If you used a sand dollar as your focal point, consider gluing down a tiny starfish in the middle.

, You may have some gaps between your shells, especially along the bottom. You can fill these in with small items, such as glass beads, pearl beads, or tiny rhinestones. Bits of sea glass would also look pretty., Your crown is essentially done at this point, but if it feels like it's missing something, consider adding some rhinestones. Use super glue to attach tiny rhinestones to the shells. You can put the rhinestones around the edges of the shells or down the ridges. If you used a starfish, you could add rhinestones down the middle of each arm."

However, you will need to have some special materials to complete this project. You will need:Two kinds of fabric. You will need fabric for the outside and inside of your sleeping bag. Use two different ones for the inside and outside of the sleeping bag. Cotton fabric is easy to work with, or you can try something like fleece or flannel for a softer, cozier sleeping bag.Batting. This will go in between your two fabrics to provide insulation and fluff.

, You will need to measure and cut out two pieces of your inner fabric, outer fabric, and batting. Cut out two pieces measuring 20.5 inches and 15 inches.This sleeping bag is the perfect size for an 18 inch tall doll. If your child's doll is bigger or shorter than this, then you will need to adjust the measurements for the doll's size. Each fabric piece should be about 2 inches taller than the doll and about 3 to 5 inches wider than the doll to ensure that the sleeping bag will be nice and roomy.

, Trim along the bottom corners of the fabric and batting you have cut out so that they are curved slightly where the doll’s feet will go. Only do this on one side of the rectangles you have cut out., Before you sew all of the pieces together, make sure that the zipper is in the correct place. Lay out the pieces that will be on the inside of your sleeping bag so that they are facing each other.Then, pin the zipper to the right side of the inner fabric pieces so that the zipper is on the inside of the fabric edge. You will fold this out after you sew it to hide the raw edges.
Start pinning at the top corner and move downwards to the second curved edge.

, To keep the zipper in place while you sew everything else together, use your sewing machine to baste the zipper to the fabric pieces. Make sure that you do not sew the fabric pieces together. Just sew a baste stitch about ¼ to ½ inch from the inner fabric’s edges.Remove the pins as you go.
After you finish the baste stitch, fold over the edge of the inner fabric so that the raw edge is tucked under. You will be hiding this and securing the zipper more permanently when you stitch the three pieces of fabric together.

, Next, place the batting over the wrong sides of the inner fabric and then lay the outer fabric with the wrong sides down over that.You should have two fabric sandwiches at this point with the inner fabric, batting, and outer fabric.Make sure that you can see the print sides of both your inner and outer fabrics.

, To hide the raw edges of the outer fabric, fold the edges of the outer fabric under about ½ inch so that it wraps around the batting. Then, pin these edges to the inner fabric and zipper.Do this for both fabric sandwiches. You should have two, which you will sew together to complete the sleeping bag.
Make sure that the zipper teeth are exposed and on the outside of the fabric edges before you sew.

, To secure the zipper, sew a straight stitch along the edges where you pinned the three fabrics together.Since you will be sewing through four layers, you may want to use a heavy duty needle, or at least go slowly.

Sew all the way around the edges where you have pinned the fabrics and zipper together.
Remove the pins as you go.
Repeat for both sides (both fabric sandwiches) of the sleeping bag.

, With the zipper unzipped, lay the pieces so that the inner fabric is on the outside. Then, line up the edges so that the longest non-zippered edges are even.

Sew along these edges making sure that you go through all six pieces of fabric.
You may want to use a heavy duty needle to sew these six pieces of fabric together.
After you finish sewing along this edge, trim off any excess fabric greater than ½ inch past the seam.
Turn the sleeping bag right side out and it is ready for your doll to use!

, If you want your doll sleeping bag to look like it is quilted, then you can sew across all layers of fabric in a criss-crossing pattern to create a quilted effect.To do this, start at one corner and sew all the way to the opposite corner. Then, start sewing at another corner and sew to the opposite corner. The result will be a big X across the fabric.
Keep repeating this criss-crossing pattern by moving the starting point up a couple of inches each time.
This works best if you do it before adding the zipper and hemming the other side.

, You can add some cute flair to your doll sleeping bag by adding embellishments to the corners or to the top of the sleeping bag. Try sewing on buttons, silk flowers, pompoms, ribbon, or other embellishments.You can also use some pretty ribbon to secure the sleeping bag when it is rolled up.

, You can make a pillow to go with your doll’s sleeping bag by using two pieces of fabric. You can use the same kind you used for the sleeping bag or just something that matches.Cut out the pieces so that they are 3.5 by 8 inches each.You may want to measure the doll's head first to ensure that the pillow will be big enough.
Then, line up the pieces with the right sides (print sides) facing each other.
Leave a small gap in one side so you can turn the pieces inside out to reveal the print sides.
Then, fill the pillowcase with stuffing and hand sew the open edge with the raw edges folded in.

Needle and thread or a sewing machine;
, Take a potholder and fold it over the skillet handle to see where you need to sew it. To mark the area where you want to sew, place a few pins in the potholder to keep it in a folded position. Then, slide the potholder off the handle.You may even want to mark the line where you want to sew with a piece of chalk.

, To secure the potholder to use as a skillet handle cover, sew along the pinned edge, removing the pins as you go. Try not to sew too far away from the pins to ensure that you get a good fit for your skillet handle.After sewing along the pinned edge, your handle cover is ready to use.

To make a skillet handle cover, you will need:Two 5.5 by 7 inch pieces of fabric for the inner and outer parts of the handle cover. You can use any cotton or linen fabric you have around.
5.5 by 7 inches of insulating fabric, such as wool, fusible fleece, or even an old towel.

Pins
Scissors

, Place the insulting fabric down first, then place the piece of fabric that you want to use as your outer fabric face up over the insulating fabric. Then, place your piece that will be on the inside of the handle on top of the stack facing down., Sew a straight stitch along the short edge (5.5 inch side) of the fabrics. Sew through all three pieces along the short edge, but do not sew any of the other edges yet.You can pin first if you like, but it is not required.

, Next, separate the insulating fabric and outer fabric from the inner piece and lay them flat. The insulating and outer fabric should be going in one direction and the inner piece should be going in the other direction. Think of the fabrics like the pages of a book facing downward. You should only see the insulation, seam, and backside of the inner lining fabric.Fold the seam so that the inner fabric is facing up and then sew along the edge of the inner fabric to flatten the seam.
Sewing along this edge will help to flatten the seam against the insulating and outer fabrics.

, To start making the fabric look like a handle cover, fold it over lengthwise. Then, pin the edges together and leave a two inch gap in long edge of the inner piece. You will need this gap for turning the handle cover inside out and revealing the outer fabric. After you finish pinning, sew along the edges except for the two inch gap along the long edge of the fabric.You can stitch around ends in a square shape, or you can stitch in a curving fashion. Either one works, but stitching a curved hem may provide a better fit for the handle cover. You can stitch curved ends free hand or use a pen to draw a curve and sew along this edge. Be sure to sew both ends.

, Use the two inch gap you left in the inner piece to invert the handle cover. When it is completely inside out, the inner and outer fabric print sides should be visible and the insulation should be hidden. Then, close the gap you left in the inner fabric.To close the gap you left for inverting the handle cover, sew across the edge. Don’t worry about any visible raw edges. These will be hidden when you tuck the inner fabric into the outer fabric.

, To finish the project, all you need to do is tuck the inner fabric into the outer fabric side. Use your fingers to tuck this material in. You can also use a pencil (eraser end) to help you push it in, or simply slide the skillet cover onto your skillet handle.After the inner fabric is hidden, your project is complete!

Offices or spare bedrooms are perfect for turning into sewing rooms. While it doesn't have to be large, make sure the space is at least enough for a storage area and a sewing table or desk.

If you do not have an entire room to devote to sewing, set aside an area in a room that is used for other things. A bedroom, office, family room, den, or even a closet could have a sewing space in it.If sharing a space within another room, determine if you want to keep it open or divide the space for separate uses.
Make sure whatever space you choose has easy access to electrical outlets for your equipment, lamps, or computer.;
, An old computer desk will work perfectly for a sewing table. You can also use a chest of drawers for storage. Consider what large items you want in the room, such as an ironing board or couch.


If you'd like to include a cutting table, it needs to be accessible from multiple sides and be large enough to fit the fabric for whatever projects you'll be working on. You should also make sure the table is high enough for you to stand without back pain.If you have a small space, try to use things that will double up your storage. For example, you can set your sewing machine on a desk and use the drawers for storage.
Don't forget to include a way to store trash, recycling, and project scraps.

, Include your equipment and items from step 2. These could be things like a desk for your sewing machine, cutting table, small couch, ironing board, storage, and shelves.


Remember to include bookcases or wall-mounted shelves. Closet companies can help install custom storage, or you can buy closet organizer kits and install them yourself.
Make a cutting area, sewing area, and pressing area. Place these areas in a work triangle to maximize efficiency when moving around the room.If you have a large room, placing your workstation in the center of the room allows you to work on all sides., Start with any built-in storage, then add the desk or sewing table, and any portable storage.


Keep electricity outlets in mind when setting up machinery and lamps. Make sure you won't have to use electrical cords, which could be tripping hazards.If you use power strips, use a surge protector to prevent any damage to your machinery.
Make sure the room has good general light. This could come from windows. You'll also need lots of localized light for projects. You'll require several task specific lamps that allow you to direct light., These could include bolts of fabric, an ironing board, or a full length mirror. Make sure things that you frequently use are easy to access, while tools you only occasionally use are well stored and labeled so that you can find them.


Ironing board caddies that hang on the door are a great way to save space in a smaller sewing room.
A large mirror can be placed on the back of a door, if you can't fit a full length mirror in the room.
Care should be taken when storing fabric. Make sure it's out of direct sunlight, as prolonged exposure could cause it to fade. Fabric can be hung, stored folded on shelves, rolled and stored in boxes, or filed in a cabinet., These could be tools you don't use frequently or you'd simply like to store out of sight. For example, you might have a bunch of small notions that you occasionally use, but want to store. You might consider placing them all in the compartments of a toolbox, then keep the toolbox in a closet.Closets are one of the best ways to store materials. The shelves are good for storing bolts of fabric, or boxes of equipment and scraps. You can also hang fabric from the clothing rod in the closet.Pull-out storage keeps items hidden, but easy to access. Consider using a pull-out shelf in a cabinet or desk.A file cabinet is useful for keeping patterns organized.If you don't want to see a file cabinet in your room, you can always place it in the closet and store items on top of it, for added storage.

, A benefit of this is that you'll quickly be able to find these items. Clear storage is a good way to store bobbins, needles, measuring tape, and pins.


If you're worried about your space looking cluttered, make sure the items are organized by type, but displayed in a similar manner. For instance, arranging all your buttons, regardless of color, in several similar clear jars quickly shows you what colors you have while keeping them uniform.Pegboard is also a good option for visibly displaying and storing frequently used materials.Rods can be attached in order to display spools of ribbon or thread. Pegboard is a good alternative to drawer storage when it comes to ease of use.

, Keep in mind that cool colors (blues, greens, purples) have a calming effect while warm colors (reds, pinks, oranges) excite.


Consider what mood you want to evoke in your room. For example, if you want a relaxing room, consider using green. Yellow-orange creates an inviting atmosphere. To help you focus on projects, consider blue-green. Red-orange can encourage creativity.Keep lighting in mind when choosing color for the walls. If your room doesn't have much natural light, you might not want to choose a darker color. Lighter colors can make the room feel brighter and larger.If you don't want to paint or wallpaper the room, but would still like to change the color, you can display quilts, hang curtains, or paint shelving units in your chosen color.

, Make sure your room is comfortable so you'll enjoy using it. Cushions, pillows, and soft throws can make the room cozier and more inviting. This is also a great way to add color and display soft furnishings you've made.


Soft furnishings have practical uses. Rugs are great for adding comfort to hard flooring and absorbing noise. Pillows and cushions can make your chairs or couch more comfortable.A cushioned chair on wheels can also prevent back pain when working long hours at your workspace.If you'd like to redecorate your sewing room as the seasons change, swap out rugs, cushions, or curtains for a quick and inexpensive room update.Think vertically when personalizing your room. A large wall is a great place to hang a finished quilt. Bookshelves are handy places to store blankets or cushions for easy use while displaying pops of color.

, Have an inspiration board or wall where you can hang project ideas. These could be magazine clippings, scraps of fabric, paint chips, or anything that motivates you.


Popular inspiration boards can be made of cork, covered with coordinating fabric, or magnetized.Place crafting magazines, books, and patterns on shelves where you can quickly get ideas. Have comfy seating nearby so you can relax and consider new projects.
You can also make a space to display completed projects or sewing collections. Arrange them on floating shelves or frame and hang them around the room.To display small items, such as bobbins or thimbles, arrange them individually in a typesetter's tray."

, Then wash according to manufacturer's directions.

, Dry in the dryer, and remove the fabric while still slightly damp. Iron the fabric until it is completely dry, using the recommended heat setting for each fabric. Delicate fabrics that cannot go in the dryer should be line dried or laid flat until almost dry and ready to be ironed.

, The interfacing will help stabilize the fabric when when sewing.

, Lay the fabric, right side down, on an ironing board. Place the interfacing, glue side down, on top of the fabric. Slightly dampen a cloth kitchen towel and place on top of the interfacing.

,,, Ironing against the grain can distort the fabric.

,,,, You can also use a serger for this.

,


If the fabric has a straight horizontal pattern, simply trim both cut ends of the fabric piece along a horizontal line.
If the fabric is woven, begin at 1 selvage edge and pull a few horizontal threads across the width of the fabric. Trim the fabric along this thread line. If you have not yet removed the selvage edges, make a vertical cut just beyond the selvage edge. Repeat on the other end.
To check that the grain is straight, fold the fabric lengthwise so the selvage edges meet and the top and bottom are straight. If there is any distortion in the fabric, it may need to be pressed with a steam iron, working from the selvage edges to the fold.

Iron your first seam.,
Pin your fabric so that the wrong sides of your fabric are be facing out.,
Sew your second seam, this time using a 3/8 inch seam allowance.,
Iron the completed double seam one more time.",How to Sew a French Seam," Consider the stitch size setting and thread tension you will need for sewing your particular fabric. If you are unsure, consult the directions for your sewing machine and adjust settings accordingly. Also prepare your sewing machine by threading it with a thread that matches the color and strength of the material you are going to sew.


This is also a good time to plug in your iron, so that it's already heated up when you need it.;
, Putting the wrong sides together is the opposite of what is normally done when sewing a basic seam, so don't worry if it feels counterintuitive. A French seam requires you to stitch each seam twice, folding over your first line of stitches in order to make your finished seam face the right direction.


Be sure to pin all the way down the seam you are sewing. This will help to make sure your fabric doesn't slip out of line.
It's a good idea to put pins in so they are perpendicular to your seam line, this way they won't stick you as you move the fabric along in the sewing machine and they will be easy to grab as you move your fabric in the sewing machine. , To keep your seam allowance the same width as you sew your seam, keep an eye on the seam allowance guide that should be printed on the thread plate of your machine. Another option is to use a 1/4 inch presser foot, that way you can just make sure the outer edge of your fabric always lines up with the edge of the presser foot.


The seam allowance is the amount of fabric that is between the edge of the fabric and the seam. Patterns usually give a specific amount of seam allowance to use, so that your finished project doesn't turn out too bit or too small. Remember that the french seam will basically require about double the allowance you use on this first seam, so make sure when you are cutting out your pieces of fabric that you have figured that into your measurements.
Feel free to increase the seam allowance on this first seam to 3/8 inch, if you are more comfortable sewing that width, but keep in mind that you will need to increase your overall seam allowance to accommodate this.
It's best to remove pins right before you are about to sew over them. This will keep the fabric in place but will avoid the risk of hitting one with your sewing machine needle, which could easily break the needle.
Remember to clip any threads and remove any remaining pins after sewing.

, You can use regular scissors or pinking shears, but if you are using a delicate fabric, pinking shears may be best to help prevent excessive fraying. Remember, this seam is not going to show by the time you are finished. Don't worry if the cut edge is a bit frayed or messy.


While it would be great if you could just sew a 1/8 inch seam, and therefore not waste any fabric, most sewing machines need more than 1/8 inch of fabric for the machine's feed dogs, the pieces of rough metal under the presser foot, to grab onto and pull along. , Open the pieces of fabric and lay it out flat on an ironing board. Iron across the seam on both the right side and the wrong side of the fabric so it lays perfectly flat. Then fold the fabric so that the right sides are facing each other (the opposite of how it was when you sewed the first seam). Iron the piece with the seam you just sewed going straight down the outer edge of the fabric. You'll want to iron very carefully and neatly so that the seam on the outer edge is perfectly straight.


Make sure your iron is set to the correct temperature for the fabric you are using. If it is set to high you will risk singeing the fabric.







, This should be easy, as you have just ironed them into place. Again, put your pins in horizontally all the way down the side of the seam so that they can be easily removed while you are sewing. The frayed edge should now be concealed between the two pieces of fabric and the outer edge is just the neat row of your first set of stitches.

, You need this amount of allowance so that the frayed edge of the fabric is tucked away neatly between the two seams. As you sew, remove the pins. Once again, remember to clip threads and remove any stray pins after sewing the seam.


If your seam allowance is too small on the second seam, the rough edges of the fabric could end up sticking out of the second seam on the finished side of your project. Its better to be cautious and make your seam allowance a bit generous.

, Press the seam to one side, depending on where you would like it to lay in your finished project. Your raw edges are no longer exposed as they are enclosed inside your newly made French seam.

Finish by serging over the tail.",How to Serge Around Corners1," Begin by serging in a straight line down the first edge of your material. Don’t stop when you reach the corner. Keep serging and go an inch or two past the end of the material and then stop the machine.By going past the end, you can serge over the excess stitches and this will secure them in place.;
, After you stop the machine, turn the fabric so that the next edge is lined up with your serger needle. Start serging just before the corner of the material. Serge to the end of this edge and go past it as you did with the last one.Continue to serge down edges and go past the edge each time. Turn the fabric each time you start on a new edge.

, After you have serged all of your corners, go past the edge and cut the tail so that it is about an inch long. Then, lay this tail over the corner nearest to it and serge over the tail and off to the side of the material. Then, snip off the new tail."
"
Snip the inside corner.,
Serge down the first edge.,
Straighten the corner.,
Continue serging to the end.,
Iron out any wrinkles in the corner after you are done.",How to Serge Around Corners2," To prevent puckering when you are serging an inside corner, it helps to make a small cut in the fabric starting at the corner.Cut about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch in from the corner, or the approximate width of your serged stitches., When you are ready to start serging, start at the top of the material. Then, serge straight down the edge towards the corner. As you approach the corner, slow down. You will need to straighten the fabric and serge over the corner slowly., Just before you reach the corner, pull the edges apart to straighten out the corner.Then, continue serging over the corner and turn the fabric slightly as you transition to the new edge.


Another option is to serge down to the corner, stop your machine, and then pivot to continue serging over the next edge. This may be a good option for thicker fabrics that are hard to straighten out., Serge to the bottom of the new edge and go past it by about an inch or two. This will leave a tail that you can sew back into the fabric, or sew over it as you go around an outside corner.

, There may be a few wrinkles in the fabric after you serge over the corner. However, you can simply iron the fabric to get these wrinkles out."
"
Lift the presser foot for an outside curve.,
Straighten out the fabric for an inside curve.,
Go slow.",How to Serge Around Corners3," To move the fabric in a curving fashion, you will need to release the pressure on your fabric. By lifting up the presser foot and using your fingers to guide the fabric along, you will be able to serge around the outside curve.You may want to just lift the presser foot for the sharpest portion of the curve and then lower the foot back down when you get past this part.
Watch your fingers when you have the presser foot up! Keep them well away from the needle.

, If the curve is on the inside of your material, then straightening out the fabric may be your best option. Tug on both sides of the fabric to straighten it out and then serge in a straight line down the edge., No matter what kind of curve you are serging, going slow will probably improve your results. Take your time and stop the machine if anything starts to bunch up."

Find suitable fabric (scraps are great provided they're large enough), such as cotton, satin, velvet, gingham, etc. You'll also need scissors to cut the fabric.;
, The fabric should be cut about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4"" wider than the soap on each side. This is important because each of these sides will be tied up.

, Cut a good length to start with–it is easier to cut the fabric shorter rather than to discover you haven't used enough fabric. Alternately, don't cut the length on the fabric bolt or larger piece of fabric, until after you have rolled in the soap and you're sure of the length required.

, Keep rolling until you reach the end. Try not to make the layering too thin or too thick; finish rolling when the layering feels just right (this will be dependent on the fabric type). The fabric used here was a shiny stretch fabric that has a lot of give and is satiny soft; it was wound over about four times.

,,, Use ribbon, string, raffia, etc. to hold in place tightly.

, Finish off by making a neat bow. Cut off any extra lengths. If using ribbon, cut diagonally to prevent fraying.

, Store the soap Pincushion in your sewing basket. Here are the benefits of your new soap Pincushion:


The pins and needles are coated in soap, making them easier to slide into fabric;
Your sewing basked is nicely scented; and
The pins won't rust.

With a simple sewing machine, plan to make a three sectional carrier.,
Remove your worn out carrier, from the waistband, with a medium or small sized seam ripper.,
Sew the worn carrier on the polyester fabric.,Fold the left section, at the dotted line and iron it.,Zig zag, or make a double seam, just inside of where you will trim in step 7.,
Fold the right section behind the middle section and iron it.,
Cut off the excess fabric off of the right section and baste the right section to the other two sections.,
Sew two seams and this will bind the three sections together.,
Mount the carrier on the pants.",How to Mend a Worn Carrier,"

The left section will be completed hidden so the edge do not have to be covered.
The middle section will be visible.
The right section will not be visible and will come in contact with the belt. The raw edges must be covered with a zig zag or at least two seams to prevent it from fraying.;
,

Have an excellent lighting system here and at all times.
Put on your reading glasses and use an LED magnifying glass on a gooseneck stand.
Open the carrier with the seam ripper, iron it and place on a thin but strong polyester fabric. You must have enough to cover the middle section of your three sectional carrier.
Use fabric glue sparingly on the back side of the worn carrier to strengthen it, if it bonds to the thin, polyester fabric.. fine! Fabric glue can seep through the layers of fabric and be visible from the outside however because a worn carrier will be thin it is important to fortify it. Ironing adhesive facing to the worn carrier fabric is an alternative but it will add a little bulk to it.

, Note that the right section is a bit wider than necessary because it will be easier to work with.,,, Compare the width other carriers with a ruler with small increments., Alternately, cut off the excess fabric after Step 8., Mark with a straight edge the two lines with a wax pencil and sew directly and evenly on the lines.,

Hand sew the carrier firmly on the waistband.
Measure how the other carriers were sewn on the waistband and follow those measurements exactly and accurately. You will need the: 1) the excess fabric measurements from the fold at the top and bottom, 2) the stitch distance from the top of the waistband, 3) the distance of the bottom stitch to the bottom of the carrier, and 4) the zig zag width.
Mark with a wax pencil the outline of the carrier on the waistband so if it moves you will know. The correct placement of the carrier will not be known until after you have finished sewing, you must mark the outline and other markings.

, Cut out a round oval with a flat base from your white fleece. It should be as wide as your hoodie and be long enough to reach the bottom of your chest.

, Cut out seven of Totoro's signature grey markings using your grey fleece.

, Evenly space out the markings in two rows on the stomach piece. The bottom row should have four markings, and the top should have three. Refer to your picture if you are not sure where they should be placed. Once you are satisfied with the position, either sew or glue the markings in place.

, Center your completed stomach piece on your hoodie and pin so that it won't move. Try it on to see if the stomach piece is placed correctly. If you are satisfied, sew the stomach piece down, making sure you only sew through one side of the hoodie. Otherwise, you might sew your hoodie together by accident.

, Cut out four diamond shaped pieces from the grey fleece, making sure to leave at least .5 in (1 cm) of seam allowance. Sew two pieces together and turn right side out to create one ear. Make sure not to sew the base of the ear, or else you won't be able to turn it right side out to hide the seams. Repeat for the other ear.

, Totoro's ears stick straight up, so place a piece of cardboard inside each ear so they will stand up straight.

, Cut two slits in the top of your hood where you want the ears to be. Place the ears inside of these holes and sew shut.

Arrange the boxes in the bottom of the large box.,
Glue the small boxes down.,
Make the divider.,
Arrange the rest of your little boxes on top of the divider, and glue them down.,
Consider covering the outside of your divider.,
Wait for everything to dry, then put the box together.,
Consider decorating the lid of your box.",How to Make a Sewing Box1," It can be a shoe box, or even a decorative box from an arts and crafts store with a magnetic lid.;
, You can paint the box using acrylic paint or spray paint. If you want to cover the box with fabric or paper instead, cut the fabric/paper down to fit side. Glue each panel of fabric/paper to each side, one at a time.The box can be the same color/pattern on the inside as on the outside, or completely different. You also don't need to cover the inside-bottom part of the box, as it will be covered.


If you are using fabric, try something with a pattern, such as calico or gingham.
Consider making the outside patterned, and the inside solid-colored.

, You will need enough for both the bottom and top layer. They need to be half the height of your large box, or shorter.


The boxes must be the same height, or the second tier won't lay flat.
If you can't find enough small boxes, you can make your own, or make a grid using cardboard.

, The boxes will be sitting inside the big box, so you won't see the sides. If you want the little boxes to blend in better, make them the same color/pattern as the inside of the big box. If you want a little more contrast, make them the same color/pattern as the outside of the big box.

, Consider using different sized boxes to hold different sized items. You can even fill only half of the big box with little boxes; this will give you lots of extra space for large items, such as fabric, fusible interfacing, patterns, or scissors.If you choose to have a large, empty space, you will need to ""fill"" it in with more paint, fabric, or paper so that the bare box does not show.

, Start on one side, in the corner, and work your way to the other. Spread a thin layer of liquid glue (such as tacky of school glue) over the bottom and sides of the little box, and press it down. Keep doing this with all of the boxes until the entire bottom layer is filled.


If the sides of the little boxes are not sticking together properly, consider clipping them shut while they dry, them removing the clips later. Clothespins and binder clips are perfect for this.

, Measure the length and width of the inside of your box. Draw a rectangle on a sheet of cardboard according to those measurements. Cut the cardboard out and check to see if it fits inside the box. Once you are happy with the fit, cover the bottom with paint, fabric, or paper. You will be gluing the rest of your little boxes to the blank side.

, Once you are happy with your arrangement, start gluing the boxes down. Spread a layer of glue along the bottom of a corner box, and two of the sides. Press the box down onto the divider, with the glue sides facing inward. Keep gluing the boxes down until there are none left.


When you are doing the boxes on the edges, be careful of where you put the glue. You want the glue only on the sides that will be touching the other boxes.

, By now, the bottom and the compartments of your divider should be colored. The edges are blank. You can fix this by covering the bare sides of the little boxes with more paint, fabric, or paper. Try to match whatever you used on the bottom of the divider.

, Fill the bottom compartments with items you don't use as much. Place the top compartments/divider on top. Fill the top compartments with items you use most often. Close your box and put it on your sewing table, or wherever you store your sewing supplies.

Consider decorating the lid of your box.",How to Make a Sewing Box2," The tins that cookies come in a perfect for this. If you cannot find such a tin, arts and crafts stores sell very similar ones.

, Wash the box with soap and warm water, and dry it off. If you plan on painting the box, wipe it down with a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol. This will get rid of any oil residue that might prevent paint from sticking.


This would be a good idea even for store-bought boxes that never held cookies.

, The designs on a cookie tin can give your sewing box some old-fashioned charm, but you can paint it if you don't like the design or color. Take the lid off the box, and spray paint both with a primer. Wait for the primer to dry, then spray paint it using your favorite color. If you need to apply a second coat, wait for the first one to dry before applying it.


Try to apply the primer and paint lightly. It is better to do many light coats than one thick coat. Thick coats are more likely to create drips and puddles.
Avoid painting the inside of the box. The paint will get scratched off by the objects inside.

, You will be using these measurements to make your grid.

, Try to use a stiffer or thicker cardboard for this; it will be more durable and less likely to lose its shape.

, You can match the color to the outside of the box, or use a completely different color for contrast.

, Find the center of each strip. Cut a notch halfway into the strip. The notch should be about the same thickness as the cardboard you are using. This will give you four large compartments.


If you want more compartments, cut more strips of cardboard and more notches. You will need to trim down some of the strips in order to fit them inside the box.

, Form a cross with the strips. Make sure that the notches are facing each other, then slide them into place. If your grid is too wobbly, draw a line of glue along the seams. This will strengthen it. Try to use a liquid glue that dries clear.

, If you want to glue it down, draw a line of glue along the bottom and side edges, then slide the grid into place. To make it stronger, draw a line of glue along the seams.


If you gave your divider more compartments, you will need to cut them shorter until the divider fits inside the box.

, The box will be too small to store large items, such as scissors, but it is perfect for smaller items, such as ribbon, thread, and needles. Consider storing like items with like items. For example:


Place your needles, sewing pins, and pin cushions in the first compartment.
Place your ribbon, lace, and hem tape in the second compartment.
Put the buttons, hooks, and clasps in a third compartment.
Use the last compartment for zippers and elastic.

Glue the fabric down onto the lid.,
Wait for everything to dry, then fill the box.,
Consider decorating the lid of your box.",How to Make a Sewing Box3," Try to use one made from cardboard as opposed to foam. The more compartments your carton has, the more notions you will be able to store inside of it.

, You can paint it all one color, or you can paint the inside a different color to add contrast. The carton's labels may show through some paints after they dry. If this happens, paint on another coat. You may need two or three coats total.


The hinge may fall apart after a while. To make your box stronger, consider gluing down a length of ribbon along the hinge, both on the outside and inside of your box. You can do this before or after your paint the box.

, You don't need to measure the height. You will be using these measurements to cut your fabric and batting.

, The fabric needs to be the same length and width as the lid. The batting needs to be the same width, but only half the length.


For the cotton, choose a printed fabric, such as gingham or calico.
If you can't find quilt batting, get some felt or fleece. Use 2 to 3 layers to get the right thickness. You will need to glue the layers together.

, Cover one half of the lid with glue. Press the batting down into it. This will create a nice cushion for needles, pins, and safety pins.


You can use regular liquid glue or fabric glue for this.

, This will hold your scissors. Make sure that the side you are sewing the elastic on is opposite the batting. How long you cut the elastic depends on how big your scissors are. A 1 to 2 inch (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) long piece should be enough for most scissors.You will be sliding the scissors down blade-fist into the elastic.


A 6 compartment egg carton may not be big enough to hold regular fabric scissors. Consider cutting a smaller elastic to use for embroidery scissors or a seam ripper.
For an added touch, glue a large, colorful button to each end of the elastic after you sew it down. This will also help cover the edges. Try to use a contrasting color. For example, if your fabric is blue, use red buttons.

, Use fabric glue to draw a line all the way around the inside lid. Try to get some glue in the space between the batting and the sides of the lid as well. Cover the blank/non-batting side of the lid with glue as well. Press the fabric down into the glue, and smooth out any bubbles and wrinkles. Make sure that the elastic side is opposite the batting side.


Use a pen or pencil to get the fabric down into the tight space between the batting and the sides of the lid.
For an added touch, glue down some ribbon onto the edges of the fabric when you are done. This will also help hide the raw edges. Try to use a contrasting color. For example, if your fabric is blue, use a red ribbon.

, Slip some pins and needles into the batting, and slide your scissors blade-first through the elastic. Fill each compartment with small items, such as buttons, hooks, clasps, and spools of thread. Close your box and put it on your sewing table, or wherever you store your sewing supplies.


A small pin cushion will fit in most egg cartons.
Roll up larger items, such as ribbon, lace, elastic, and zippers, before stuffing them into the compartments.

Include some basic sewing supplies.,
Consider choosing a variety of scissors.,
Include some needles and pins.,
Have a variety of thread.,
Try including some notions.,
Consider including some other useful tools.",How to Make a Sewing Box4," Every sewing box should include some basics, including a pair of fabric scissors, some needles, and thread. Depending on the size of your box, you could include more or fewer items. This section will give you some suggestions., Basic fabric scissors are a must. They are great for beginners and those who just plan on cutting fabric and snipping thread. There are a few other types of scissors that might make more advanced sewing projects easier, however:Pinking shears are like fabric scissors, but with a zigzag edge. Edges cut with these scissors are less likely to fray.
Rotary cutters are great for cutting long, straight lines. You'll want a self-healing cutting matt for one of these as well.
Thread snips are great for snipping thread close to the fabric when you are machine sewing.
Embroidery scissors are tiny scissors perfect for hand-embroidery projects. They are able to cut your thread close to the fabric and are easily portable.

, Sewing needles are essential, even if you only plan on using your sewing machine. You will likely come across a few projects that will require just a regular needle and thread. Sewing pins are also important. Consider getting a pack of them; one can never have too many.


If you own a sewing machine, consider including replacement needles for your sewing machine. You can also include different types of needles for different weights of fabric, such as jean, cotton, and shear.
Pincushions are great for sticking pins into during your sewing project. You can have a standard ball-shaped pincushion, or one of those with a band that you can strap to your wrist.
Thimbles are useful for those who are clumsy when it comes to hand sewing. They will spare you lots of painful, pricked fingers.
Needle threaders are great for those who have poor eyesight, unsteady hands, or are working with very tiny needles. They look like coins, but with a thin, metal loop attached to it.

, Thread might seem like a no-brainer, but it might be a good idea to have an assortment of thread, such as standard thread and heavy-duty thread. Some sewing projects will require strong, thick thread.


Standard thread
Heavy duty thread
Embroidery thread
Light, medium, and dark colors for repairs.

, Even if you are not an advanced seamstress or tailor, having a few notions, such as buttons, might be a good idea. They are great for repairs and last minute arts and crafts projects. Here's a list to give you some ideas:


Buttons, hooks, and fasteners
Ribbon and lace
Hem tape and bias tape
Elastic
Fusible interfacing
Safety pins

, If you do a lot of sewing, you might find certain items quite useful. It all depends on what you usually sew. Here are some suggestions:


Measuring tape is always useful to have around, not just for sewing. It is essential for those who work with patterns. They help you get the measurements right the first time around and lessen the chances of mistakes.
Seam rippers make undoing mistakes a lot easier and quicker. They are great for those who work with sewing machines and need to undo a lot of tiny, tight stitches.
Point turners are small tools ideal for pushing out points and corners. They are ideal for those who sew cuffs, collars, bags, and other items with tight corners.
Grommet setters and other setters are essential for those who will be working with grommets, eyelets, and other types of fasteners.
Tailors chalk or water soluble markers are perfect for those who like to draft their own patterns, or who need to make alterations.
Fray check glue, while not essential, it great when you are sewing with delicate fabrics that fray easily.

Gather your materials.,
Cut your faux fur.,
Sew the faux fur pieces together.,
Add a zipper, if desired.,
Stuff the pillow.,
Sew the pillow closed or zip it up.",How to Make a Faux Fur Pillow1," Faux fur pillows are quick and easy to make. You just need some special materials to make them, such as:About ½ yard of faux fur fabric
Pillow insert or stuffing materials
Sewing machine (optional)
Needle and thread
Measuring tape
Chalk
Scissors
Pins
18 inch (45.7 cm) zipper (optional);
, You will need your faux fur to be about the same size as your pillow insert. If you are using stuffing material, then you can make your pillow any size you like. Just make sure that the pieces are the same size. For example, if your pillow insert is 18 by 18 inches (45.7 by 45.7 centimeters), then you might want to cut your fabric to 20 by 20 inches (50.8 by 50.8 centimeters) to account for the seams.
Always be careful to avoid cutting through the faux fur.You can brush the fur to the sides of where you need to cut to avoid it and make sure to go slowly.
Only cut through one layer of fabric at a time., Place the faux fur pieces so that the fur sides are facing each other. Then, begin to sew along the edge of the fabric, about ½” (1.3 cm) from the edges. Sew three of the four edges using a straight stitch.Be sure to leave one side of the faux fur pillow cover open so that you can slide the pillow insert in or stuff the cover before sewing up the final edge.
Keep in mind that you can also hand sew these edges if you do not have a sewing machine. Just thread a needle and stitch along the edges of the fabric.

, If you want to include a zipper on your pillow, then do this next. To add a zipper, unzip the zipper and then pin the edges of the zipper to the wrong sides of the fabric. The zipper pull should be facing inwards. Then, sew along the edges of the zipper and fabric to connect them.The zipper will be visible on one side of the pillow, but you can easily hide it by placing the pillow zipper side down.

, Before you close up the pillow, turn it inside out to expose the fur. Then, stuff it with the pillow insert or stuffing material to give it a form. You can make your pillow as full as you like, just be careful not to overstuff it or the excess stuffing may stress the seams., If you decided to skip the zipper, then you will need to sew up the final edge to make your pillow complete. If you added a zipper, then you can simply zip it shut and you are done!To sew up the final edge, thread a needle and stitch along the edge. If desired, you can tuck the faux fur fabric edges in slightly to avoid any exposed raw edges. Sew to the end of the edge being careful to keep the pillow stuffing or pillow insert inside the cover. Then, tie a double knot in the thread to secure it and cut off the excess.

Turn the pillow cover inside out and insert the pillow.",How to Make a Faux Fur Pillow2," Making a faux fur pillow cover is even easier than making a faux fur pillow, but you will get the same effect. To make a faux fur pillow cover, you will need:Standard size pillow
Enough faux fur fabric to cover the pillow and overlap slightly
Pins
Sewing machine

, Take the fabric and wrap it around the longest sides of your pillow. The fabric should overlap by a few inches in the back. Make sure that the raw edges of the overlapping fabric are both on the same side of the pillow. This will serve as the opening to your pillow case.The fabric should be fitted, but not too tight.
If needed you can trim the fabric to better fit your pillow, but be careful. Make sure that you avoid cutting through any of the fur fibers as you cut.

, Pin the fabric to hold it in place. Although you will be sewing along the short edges, pinning along the long edges or pinning the area where the fabric overlaps itself is a better strategy. This way you will be able to slide the fabric off the pillow before you sew., Remove the fabric from the pillow while keeping it in the overlapping position. Do not turn it inside out! The fur should remain facing in until you finish sewing.To sew your pillowcase, sew along the short edges of the faux fur fabric. You can use a simple straight stitch to do this. Sew across each edge two times to ensure that it is secured.
Remove the pins after you finish sewing, or as needed to sew through the fabric.

, After you finish sewing, turn the pillowcase right side out to reveal the furry side. Then, slip the pillow through the opening in the pillow case. Arrange the flaps to ensure that the pillow is completely covered by the fur pillow case.Place the pillow with the flap side facing down so that it is hidden.

Attach the mold to the sprue base using a bit of melted rubber.,
Put the flask on top of the sprue base, making sure you have a quarter inch between the wall of the flask and the model.",How to Cast Jewelry1," Start simple for now, as complex molds are much harder to keep together at first. Get a piece of modeling wax and use a precision knife, Dremel, and any other tool needed to make a model of your jewelry. Whatever shape you make now will be the shape of your finished piece.


You are making an exact replica of your eventual jewelry.
Using a piece of jewelry you like as a model will help you design better pieces when you first start.;
, Using some more wax, craft several long, wires out of wax and attach them to the model so that they all lead away from the piece. This is easier to understand when you see the whole process -- this wax will be covered in plaster, then melted out to make a hollow version of your shape. You then fill in the hollow part with silver. f you don't make sprues, the melted wax can't actually get out and make a hollow area.









For smaller pieces, like a ring, you may only need one sprue. Larger pieces, like belt buckles, may need up to ten.
All the sprues should meet at the same place. They will need to be attached to a sprue base.

, The sprues all meet together, and you attach the mold to the sprue base where all the sprues meet. This allows the wax to melt through the bottom of the base and leave the mold.








, The flask is a big cylinder that slides on top of the sprue base.

Remove the flask from the kiln while hot, and check the bottom of the mold for obstructions.",How to Cast Jewelry2," The model should be propped up in the flask. It is ready for the jewelry casting process.









Note: In the video, the excess silver parts are other pieces of jewelry going along with the belt buckle. They are not extra sprues or necessary additions.

, Follow the instructions of whatever investment mold you choose to purchase -- it should be a simple set of measurements.









Wear a mask or respirator whenever possible as you work with this powder -- it is not safe to inhale.
Move on once you have the mix the consistency of pancake batter.

, If you do not have a vacuum sealer, you can just let it sit for 10-20 minutes. Air bubbles will create holes, which may allow the metal to seep in and create a pock-marked final piece of jewelry.








, You will completely encase your mold in plaster. Re-vacuum the mixture to get rid of any last, small bubbles before moving on.









Wrap a layer of tap around the top of the flask, so that half the tape sits over the lip and helps contain the plaster from bubbling over.

, Follow the exact instructions and drying time for your plaster mix before moving on. When done, remove the tape and scrape any excess plaster from the top of the mold.








, Note, different plasters may have different temperatures. However, you should not be at anything less than 1100. This will harden the mold and melt the wax away, leaving a hollow chamber in the center of the cast jewelry mold.









This may take up to 12 hours.
If you have an electronic kiln, try to set it to slowly raise the temperature up to 1300. This can help prevent cracking., Make sure that the hot wax can easily leak out of the mold, and that there is nothing obstructing it. If there is nothing in the way, shake the flask gently to make sure all the wax came out. There should be a puddle of wax in the reservoir of the flask or at the bottom of the kiln.









Make sure you wear safety gloves and goggles.

Place your metal of choice in a pouring crucible, then melt it inside a foundry.,
Use a jeweler's centrifuge (Centrifugal Casting Machine) to pour the metal into the mold.,
Allow the metal to cool for 5-10 minutes, then dunk it slowly in cold water.,
Tap the mold gently with a hammer to break away any excess plaster and reveal the jewelry.",How to Cast Jewelry3," The melting temperature and time will be determined by the type of metal you are using. You can also use a blow-torch and small crucible to melt your silver.








, For professional jewelry, you'll need a centrifuge. This evenly distributes the metal quickly, but it is not the only option you have for casting. The more classic, easier solution is to simply pour the metal careful into the tunnel left by the base of the mold.









You could use a large, metal-specific syringe to pump the metal into the mold, too.

, The amount of time it needs to cool is dependent, of course, on the metal melted and used. Dunk too soon and the metal may crack -- dunk too late and it will be hard to remove all the plaster from the hardened metal.









Look up cooling times for your metal before moving on. That said, if you're in a pickle you can just wait 10 minutes and then dunk in cold water.
The plaster should begin dissolving away as you shake it around the cold water.

, Separate the flask from the sprue base and use your fingers or a toothbrush to peel away any last bits stuck to the jewelry.

Use an angle grinder with a cut-off wheel to cut away any lines of metal from the sprues.,
Consider and acid bath or wash to clean off any last bits of plaster.,
Buff out any irregularities on the jewelry piece using a metal buffing wheel.",How to Cast Jewelry4," Cut away the thin pieces of metal that you needed to create a hole to pour the metal in. A hand-held grinder should be more than strong enough.








, The firing process often leaves metal dingy and dirty looking. You can look into specific washes for certain metals, which will lead to a much nicer shine and an easier job cleaning up the piece later.








, Use files, enamel clothes, polishes, etc. to clean the piece up to your desired style. If you planned on setting a stone, do it after you finish polishing.

Choose a material color.,
Cut the strip to about 8in (20cm) long (optional).,
Fold the ribbon over itself at the halfway mark to form a corner.








,
Fold the bottom strand of ribbon over the central folds.,
Continue folding each bottom strand over the central folds until you have a stack of squares.,
Pinch the two lose ribbon ends together between your thumb and index finger.,
Grab one of the loose ends of ribbon and slowly pull it out of the folded accordion.,
Carefully tie a knot in the back of the rose and cut the excess ribbon.","How to Make Silk, Satin or Ribbon Roses"," Reds and pinks are traditional rose colors, but you might want to make a yellow, white, or even a black rose for a different effect.







;
, If it is shorter, it is harder to work with, and if it is longer, there will be far more ribbon than is required for a rose. Note that since you will cut the ribbon again when the rose is complete, you can skip this step to avoid wasting lengths of ribbon.








,, The other strand of ribbon will now be on the bottom.








, Alternate folds until the stack is of considerable thickness or you’ve almost run out of ribbon.








, Don't worry about letting go of the stack of squares; because they’re folded together, they will simply stretch out into an accordion.








, Be sure to keep the other end stationary as you pull. This will bunch the folds of the accordion more closely together, making a little knot of petals. Pull until the rose is the size and shape you desire, but note that if you pull too far, the folds will pop right out and the rose will be undone.








, It might help to flip the rose over and press the ribbon down with one finger while you tie the knot. Again, do not pull the strands too hard or you will undo the petal folds.

Find a pair of gloves.,
Try the gloves on and make a mark where you'd like to the fingers to end.,
Take the gloves off and cut ¼-inch (0.64-centimeters) above your cutting line.,
Cut the thumb off.,
Hem the cut edges.,
Pull the glove on and make sure that it fits comfortably.",How to Make Fingerless Gloves1," They can be old or brand new, just as long as you're willing to re-purpose them. Old ones that have holes around the fingertips are great this project, as they'll get a new lease on life.


Gloves made from cotton, wool, angora, lambswool, cashmere are all great choices.;
, In most cases, you will want to cut them right at the first knuckle. Use a tailor's chalk (for dark gloves) or pen (light colors) to draw a line across your fingers.

, You will be hemming your gloves so that they don't fray. Once you hem them, they will be the right length.


Measure your other glove against the one you just cut, and cut that one too. This way, they will be even.

, You can cut the entire thumb off, or you can cut it off at the middle. If you want to be more precise, pull the glove on, and draw a cutting line as you did with the fingers., Working one finger at a time, fold the raw edge inward by ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter). Sew around the finger using a loose, running stitch or a hem stitch. Knot the thread, then snip the excess off.


Pull the glove on before knotting the thread. This way, your finger will stretch and loosen the hem so that it fits.
You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.

, Make any adjustments, if necessary. Once you are happy with the fit, repeat the process for the other glove.

Choose a weave that you like.,
Choose a design you like.,
Choose your material.,
Choose your tools.,

,
Begin building the next row.,Place one closed ring on another ring (blue).,
Add it to the pattern, linking this blue ring through three other rings.

,
Build the rest of the row, by repeating the last few steps.

,
Repeat Part Two of the article to add each new row.,
Make a second piece.",How to Make Chainmail," This article describes one method of weaving: the European 4-in-1 weave, a common and widely used weave. It gets its name from the fact that each non-edge ring has four other rings connected to it.


There are ways to vary the basic European 4-in-1 weave that this article describes, such as the European 4-in-1 expanding (FFF) or make the European 6-in-1 (where you'll use six rings in one, rather than the four in one described by this article).;
, If you are just beginning, start with something fairly small and simple until you get the hang of it. A full chainmail shirt has thousands of rings in it and can weigh more than 30 pounds. Instead, try a bracelet, belt, key chain, or other smaller, simpler design.

Try chainmail jewelry for an unusual and elegant piece that you can wear for any occasion. When choosing wire for jewelry purposes, smaller wire will be better accepted by the general public. 18 gauge (wire thickness) down to 20 or 22 gauge is common. 24 gauge and smaller wire is starting to get into rings where you may need magnification to work them well. 16 gauge and up tends to produce thicker, more bulky pieces that have limited appeal.

, Decide whether you will make your own rings from wire or purchase rings. Rings are available in a variety of combinations of inside diameters (distance between the inside edges of the ring--abbreviated to ID) and gauges (wire thickness, or wire diameter ). The relationship between these two numbers, using the formula ID/WD, is the aspect ratio (abbreviated AR).

Bigger rings will cover an area with fewer rings and less weight, but the texture will be coarser, regardless of AR.
Rings with a larger AR will not be as strong as smaller AR rings of the same material, regardless of the material. Wire of a thicker gauge will be more durable, but also weigh more and be harder to work with.
Materials for rings are not limited to plain iron or steel. You can also get rings in galvanized steel, stainless steel, aluminum, titanium, inconel, niobium, silver, gold, and rubber. You can also get rings in a variety of colors and create many different inlays with them.
An easy source of wire to get started is coat hangers. They are fairly easy to bend. The downside is that you have to cut your own rings and the result is not very strong.
Another easy (but not as easy) source for wire is to go to a hardware store and go into the Fencing section and buy a spool of electric fence wire; this type of wire is typically available very inexpensively.

, You'll need pliers for the rings, as well as a metal rod to wind the wire for the rings around. Match your pliers to your material. The pliers you would use on heavy gauge stainless steel will not be the same pliers you use on fine gauge silver.

The teeth (the serrations on the jaws) on many standard pliers may damage the metal finish of your rings, especially on smaller wire and/or softer materials. For delicate (relatively speaking) ring materials, look for toothless pliers, or even tweezers if you are working with very small wire. You can also look around for plier jaw covers. A cheap alternative to plier jaw covers is plastic tubing of the correct gauge; slip the tubing over the ends of your pliers. The pliers must be strong enough to bend the metal you are using and fine enough to handle the ring size you choose.
Types of metal rods include Phillips screwdrivers, or a steel rod purchased from a hardware store. Often you can find some type of metal rod lying about your house.

, Wooden dowels and pencils are not recommended as the forces applied while coiling your wire will compress the wood and give you rings of unequal dimensions.

You may need to control one or both ends with pliers. Aim for even, consistent loops and try to avoid putting tight kinks in the wire. If the wire came in a coil or spool, wind with the curvature that the wire already has. Also try to keep the ""spring"" as tight together as possible. The more spaced the rings are, the longer the rings actually become.
For making large quantities, make a small hole in the rod to fasten the wire and use a drill to rotate the rod. Heavy gloves are recommended with this method.

, It's especially important to wear eye protection for this step, as the rings can go flying. Aim for full, 360º rings, evenly cut. Cutting on a slight diagonal will help to achieve a tight closure with no gap.


If you want a flatter, cleaner cut, you can put the coil in a vice (preferably with the rod still inside) and cut it with a hacksaw. Doing this eliminates the sharp points in the ends of the ring that can get caught on clothes and skin.

, Thread all four onto a fifth ring (shown here in red) and close the fifth ring.


Fully close all rings to give the piece an even, finished appearance and to prevent it from catching hair. For opening and closing the rings, twist the ends of the ring away from each other. Do not pull the ends straight away from each other, as you will not get the ring to be round again. Depending on your material, you may have to close the ring past the final position you want, then bring it back.

, This looks awkward right now because the rest of the pattern isn't around it to even things out.

, Link both into another ring (also red), but do not close the red ring yet.

, Arrange the two bottom-most rings so that they are in the pattern.

,,, Pass the blue ring through the top two gold rings from the first row. Be sure that it ends up oriented the same as the red ring adjacent to it.

,,,, When the piece is as large as you want, continue to the next step., You'll need to repeat Part Two of the article to make the back."

Consider hemming the thumb hole.,
Repeat the process for the other glove.",How to Make Fingerless Gloves2," The best type of sock to work with a knee socks. Choose something with an interesting pattern that would work well for a pai of fingerless gloves, such as stripes.

, This includes the heel and toes. Simply cut in a straight line just above the heel part, where the straight part of the sock begins. Discard the foot part, or save it for another project., Place your palm and arm on top of the sock. Align the original hem with the top of your knuckles.The cut hem should end somewhere along your arm. Make a mark where your thumb is. If you want the gloves to be shorter, make a mark there as well.

For most people, the thumb hole will be about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) down from the original hem., Find where you made the thumb mark. Pinch the fabric in half horizontally, and cut a small, vertical slit. Something around ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) would be ideal.Don't worry if the thumb hole looks too small. It will stretch. Remember, you can always cut it bigger.
If you want shorter gloves, cut ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) above the mark that you made.

, Slip your arm into the sock and poke your thumb out through the thumb hole. At this point, you can widen the thumb hole. You can also cut it into more of an oval shape.

, Take the glove off. Fold the cut edge inward by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Secure it with pins, then sew it down using a stretch stitch or a zigzag stitch. You can also sew it by hand using a running stitch.

You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.
This step is not absolutely necessary, but it will give your glove a nicer touch.

, This is not absolutely necessary, since sock material does not fray that much, but it could give your glove a nicer finish. Fold the raw edge inward by about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter). Sew it by hand using a running stitch.

You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.

Connect the gap where your thumb is with a curved line.Make sure that the thumb line curves into the tracing.
Leave some space around your arm, especially if the fabric you'll be using is not stretchy.

, Be sure to leave a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) gap allowance all around the pattern. This will give you enough fabric for a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) seam allowance., Stack two layers of fabric, right sides together, then pin the pattern on top. Trace around the pattern. Flip the pattern over, re-pin it, and trace around it for the other glove.You can use any type of fabric you want. Fleece and t-shirt material are great choices because they don't fray.

, Try to cut through both layers of fabric for each glove. This way, your pieces will be even. You do not need to add seam allowances because you already added them for your original pattern., Pin the pieces together first. Sew up the left and right sides using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. If your fabric is stretchy, or if you want tighter gloves, sew using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance instead. Do not sew across the top or bottom edges or the thumb hole.If you are sewing fleece or t-shirt material, use a stretchy stitch or a zigzag stitch.

, Fold both of the top and bottom edges down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters). Pin them in place, then sew the hems down.You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting thread color.

If you are using fleece or t-shirt fabric, you can skip this step. If you choose to hem them, use a stretch stitch or a zigzag stitch.

, Fold the edges of the thumb hole down by about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter). Sew it down by hand using a running stitch. You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one.

You can use a different type of yarn, but you will need to get matching knitting needles.

, In most cases, this will be about 48 rows. Make sure that you knit every row. This will give you a stretchy, purl pattern on both sides of your work. Do not alternate between knit and purl, or your glove won't stretch right.Alternatively, you can work in seed stitch. This will give you material that stretches both ways.

, Once the gloves are wide enough to wrap around your palm, cast off your stitches. Cut the yarn leaving behind a long tail. Feed the tail through the last loop/stitch, then gently tug on it to tighten the knot. Do not cut it off., Bring the cast on and cast off edges together. This is your side seam. Place your arm on top of the glove, and align your knuckles with one of the top, narrow edges. Note where the top and bottom of your thumb is., Thread the long tail onto a yarn needle. Sew the side seam down using a whip stitch until you reach the top of your thumb joint. For most people, this will be about 2 inches (5.08 centimeters)., Once the top part of your glove is long enough to your liking, tie the tail off, then weave the tail back up the seam towards the top edge. Snip off the excess yarn., Thread the long cast on tail though your yarn needle. Sew up the bottom edge of the side seam using a whip stitch. Stop when you reach the base of your thumb. You will be left with a gap in your side seam, which is the thumb hole., As before, tie the end of the tail off, then weave it back down the seam. You don't have to weave it all the way back down--a couple of inches/centimeters will be plenty. Snip the excess yarn off., This pattern is completely reversible, so you can use the exact same method for both gloves.

, The loop should end with the long part of the wire just below the short part (when looking at it from the side with the pliers pointing upwards).

, Make sure you don't hold it so tightly it can't move up the pliers. The loops should be the same size rather than stacked in a cone shaped like the pliers.

, This allows for mistakes and the removal of sharp ends.

, This will leave you with just a coil of wire.

, Find the point where the wire ends and cut through the loop above at this point. When you take your cutters away, you should have a jump ring attached to it. Continue this step until all of the coil has been cut into jump rings.

"Select the appropriate wire for your project.,
Select the right sized dowel rod (or metal rod) for the project.,
Make a slit in one end of the rod.,
Insert one end of the wire into the slit.,
Cut jump rings.",How to Make a Jump Ring2,", If it's less that 3/8"", you will probably have to use metal as a dowel rod will break too easily., This is for anchoring the wire as you wrap. This step is not essential but makes making jump rings much easier., Then begin to tightly wrap the wire around the dowel rod towards the opposite end of the slit., Once you have wrapped enough wire on the dowel, you have several options for cutting the wire into jump rings.

One of the easier ways is to slide the wire off the rod and use parallel wire cutters to cut the rings. The drawback here is rough, sharp ends that often need to be filed/sanded.
If you are using a wooden dowel, you can also use a jewelers saw with a 2/0 blade: move the wire up the dowel to the end, hold the dowel steady and saw a straight line through it. It is also handy to wrap a single layer of masking tape around the wire so that the rings don't fall everywhere. Slowly move the wrapped wire up the rod until you are done.

Children working on this project will require the help and supervision of an adult, as sharp scissors and an oven will be used. The aid of an adult may be needed for certain steps which require attention to small details. The time it takes to complete this project will include three minutes for baking and between 15 and 30 minutes for fusing.;
, This is currently only available as a PDF file which you can find at http://www.2shared.com/document/T9COyD5v/bakugan_pendant_pattern2.html. The download link is near the bottom of the page (see image). Once you have the PDF file, print it out full-size on a regular piece of letter-size paper., First, tape the pattern down (printed side face-up) onto the surface of your workspace. Then, place a sheet of Shrinky Dinks plastic (frosted side up!) on top of the pattern, and tape it down at the edges as well. This will help to keep both pieces in place as you work., Notice that there are six different pendant patterns on the page, one for each attribute of Bakugan. You will only be tracing the outside line of this pattern for this step., Try to only fill in the space inside the lines; when the plastic is baked later, the painted areas will puff out slightly and fill out the design more. Allow the paint to dry before continuing on to the next step.

If the marker is new, or isn't painting well, you will need to prime it; shake the marker up and down for a couple of minutes (you should eventually hear the agitator sliding back and forth inside the marker), then press the marker tip down onto a scrap piece of thick paper or cardboard so that the tip retracts into the marker. Paint will start to flow into the spongy tip. It will easily make a mess, so be careful when doing this step!

, Allow this to dry before going on to the next step., This piece will remain blank, and will be used later on during fusing as the bottom piece which seals the design is inside the pendant. Simply tracing the outer edge of an adjacent pattern to get this piece saves you from having to move and re-tape the plastic.,, Remember to cut only along the pencil lines that mark the outer edges of these pieces., Make sure to remove all of the pencil marks; they will not be included in the final piece. Also be sure to keep the pieces clean from eraser filings resulting from erasing., Preheat the oven to 325ºF (163ºC) and allow it to warm up as you prepare the cookie sheet. Take the parchment paper and cut a piece that covers the cookie sheet. Then, take the pendant pieces and lay them frosted side up on the paper as shown in the picture. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, go on to the next step., As they bake, they will shrink (they are Shrinky Dinks after all) as well as become nine times thicker.

It is important to watch them during this process as they run the danger of curling up and sticking to themselves, thus preventing them from flattening out properly. Grab a chair and sit where you can see the pieces as they draw up, and keep the pair of wooden skewers or chopsticks on hand to reach into the oven and pull the pieces apart if they start curling into themselves. (Children should have an adult do this.)
Once the 3 minutes have passed, take the cookie sheet out of the oven and lay it on a heat-safe surface (or potholders) and allow the pieces to cool. Then, turn the oven temperature up to 450ºF (230ºC) and allow it to heat up. While you're waiting, work on the next step.

, This tiny piece of wire will be fused inside the pendant and will be used to hang it from a necklace chain. See the photos at right for how to bend the wire and cut off the excess with the jewelry pliers (you will need to bend the wire a bit at the non-loop end so that it cannot be easily yanked out of the pendant after fusing). The wire must not be so long that it extends past the silver ""finial"" into the clear part of the pendant, but also not so short that you can't get a lot of bends into it., Get the Pyrex dish and begin layering the pieces inside it. The blank piece is laid frosted side down on the glass first; the eye loop is then laid at one end of the blank piece, then the painted piece is laid frosted side down with the top end on top of the eye loop. A flat toothpick is placed under the exposed part of the eye loop to keep it from touching the glass., During this time, the top piece will melt into the bottom piece, turning them into a single piece. The frosted surfaces will flatten, causing the pendant to turn clear.

Check the pendant after 15 minutes to see if the fusing has completed; it is likely that the silver-painted ends will still need a few more minutes to fuse. Once you are satisfied with the result, remove the dish from the oven and set it on a heat-safe surface. The dish must be cool to the touch before moving on to the next step!

, Grab the pendant near the middle with the thumb and index fingers of both hands, and gently wiggle it back and forth, gradually applying more pressure, until it comes loose from the dish. There may be some clear plastic left on the dish where the edges of the pendant touched the glass; this can be easily removed with a safety razor., Your pendant may end up with some sharp or jagged edges where it was touching the glass. Use the fine-grain sandpaper to dull these edges. Be careful not to scratch the smooth plastic on top of the pendant., Remember to open the ring by bending it sideways, instead of pulling it open., Simple enough. Afterwards, close the jump ring. Alternatively, you could close the jump ring first (bending it sideways until the ends meet), then undo the chain and slide it through the ring., Wear it to your next Bakugan tournament meet and impress your opponents."

, Go back and forth many times until the width of the many stitches is 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm). Snip off the end of the cut cord in the loop and lightly burn the end you just cut with a lighter to keep it from fraying.

,, Then baste all the cords together very snugly.

, This end will be thicker so decrease the presser foot setting. After sewing, snip off the ends and burn the ends with a lighter.

, Use a belt snap on one end and a split ring to your wallet. Make sure the contents of your wallet do not fall out when hanging from the leash by attaching the leash to the center of the wallet.

Put on your paper beret.",How to Make a Beret," Berets are traditionally made out of wool felt but any thick felt should work for this project.You will not need more than a half a yard of felt for this project.


Remember that the felt is going to be resting against your forehead, so make sure it's not itchy or otherwise uncomfortable directly on the skin.;
,


If you don't own a tailor's measuring tape, which is simply a measuring tape that is really flexible, try to find a regular measuring tape or ruler that can be easily wrapped around your head. This should give you a good measurement for the band of your beret.

, Use pattern making paper or any thin paper you have at home. Your beret will be made of three pieces: the band, the top of the hat, and the underside of the hat. Remember that each piece will have to have a bit of seam allowance added to it, the fabric that gets wasted when you sew a seam, so that it will end up the right size.


Make a pattern piece for the band. The band will be a long, skinning rectangular shape with tabs sticking out along one of the long sides. For the length, add 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance to diameter of your head. Make the width 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) wide. Once you cut out the basic rectangle this size, you will also need to cut our little ""v"" shapes along one of the long sides every 1 inch (2.5 cm). Each ""v"" will need to be 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) deep, at its deepest point.
Make a pattern piece for the top of the beret. This will just be a large circle. Decide how wide you would like your beret to be, around 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter is probably good, and draw a circle that diameter on your pattern paper. You can do this with a homemade compass, consisting of a pencil tied to a string, or you can find a round item you can trace that is approximately the right size. A record would work well for this.
Make a pattern for the underside of the beret. This will consist of two circles. The larger circle will be the same diameter as the circle of the top piece. The second circle will be located in the center of the first circle and it will have the same circumference as your head.
Cut your pattern pieces out once you've drawn them.

, Position them so that they all fit on the piece of fabric you have. Use enough pins so that the pattern will be securely attached to the fabric while you cut around each pattern piece.


Next cut out all the pieces, making sure to follow the edge of the patterns carefully.

, You will need to pin all the pieces inside out, so that the seams will be on the inside of the finished project.


On some materials, such as felt, this might not matter, as both sides of the fabric are identical.
Pinning the band to the underside of the beret will be the most difficult part of pinning. You want to fold each tab over so that it is 90 degrees away from the rest of the band, then set the underside piece so that it is sitting on top of the tabs. Pin the tabs on the band to the edge of the opening in the underside piece. Once the beret is turned right side out, the tabs will not be visible and the band and the underside will be able to sit at 90 degrees from each other.

, Set your sewing machine up to the best setting it has for sewing felt or other heavy duty fabrics. If you don't think your machine will work well, you can always sew your beret by hand.


Sew the seam to close the band first. This will make your band into a full loop. You added 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) seam allowance to the end of the band, so make sure that you sew the band so that there are 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) seams on each end.
Next connect the band to the underside of the beret by sewing around the inner circle of the underside piece, as close as possible to the edge. The small tabs you made on the band will get sewn to the underside piece, connecting the two pieces together.
Finally, sew the underside piece to the top piece, making sure that all your pieces are still inside out.

, Flatten the seam between the top and underside of the beret with an iron set to the setting for the fabric you used. The seam between the underside and the band should be at a right angle, not flat, so simply manipulate it with you fingers until it is in place.

, Many berets have a small stem that comes out of the center of the top, made out of the same felt as the beret is made of. You could add a little additional embellishment of your own by attaching a small pom pom or tassel in the center of the top.

, There are a wide variety of beret patterns available at your local yarn shop. Pick one that has an interesting design but that also matches your knitting skill level.

, Choose a yarn that matches the requirements on the pattern you chose. Usually a pattern will specify the weight of the yarn to use, so that the beret you make will end up the right size.


The pattern will also specify the size needles you should use. The size of the needle you use will also have a big impact on whether or not you finished project matches the size the pattern was supposed to make.
In many cases you will also want to use circular knitting needles for knitting a beret, as the length of the swatch you are knitting is relatively long.
Pick out a yarn that will feel nice in contact with your skin. For instance, while heavy wool yarn will keep your head nice and warm, it may be itching where in contact with your forehead. Balance your need for warmth and an attractive look with a yarn that will be comfortable to wear.

, You may need to refresh your knitting skills a bit before beginning. If this is the case, consider knitting a sample swatch that practices your skills before starting your actual project. This way you can get used to the yarn and the stitches you will need to use in the project.


The basic design of most berets require that you begin by knitting a number of stitches onto your needles that will equal the circumference of your head. That's usually going to be about 60 stitches to start.Once you have knitted a few rows of that same length, which will eventually become the band of the beret, you will begin to increase your stitches at regular intervals, making the length of your knitted piece long and longer.
Once you get to the mid point of your beret, where the flat flare is at its widest, you will begin to reduce your stitches. This will create that signature flat look of the beret.
Finishing the beret requires you to reduce your stitches until you are down to around a dozen. Then you will tie all the stitches together at the top.
To create the finished shape of the beret you will then work your way down the side of the beret, sewing the two ends of the swatch you have made together. This will form your work into its final round shape.

, Your knitted beret is finished and it will keep your head nice and toasty warm.

, Pick out a mix of colorful paper.


The crepe paper should be relatively thick, so don't just buy tissue paper instead. While tissue paper may be easier to find, it's not strong enough for this project.

, Make sure you have several pieces of crepe paper piled on top of each other, as you will need to have several circles the same size. This is easiest to do by layering several pieces on top of each other and drawing the circle once, imprinting the circle onto the lower layers with the pressure of the pencil.


To make a compass simply gather a thumbtack, a piece of string that is at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) long, and the pencil you are using to draw the circle. Tie the string to the middle of the pencil. Measure the string off the pencil 6 inches (15.2 cm) and hold that spot. Then attach the other end of the string to the thumbtack right at the 6 inch (15.2 cm) mark. Place the thumbtack in the approximate middle of the crepe paper you are using and stretch out the string until it is taut. Begin drawing the circle with the pencil, keeping the string taut and the thumbtack securely placed in the middle of the paper.
There are other ways to draw a circle, such as tracing something the right size. For this project, you can simply trace a record, as it's 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. Be careful not to damage the record while you are using it, especially if it's an album you love.

, You can either hold the layers of paper together and cut once, or you can separate them and cut each out individually. The choice is yours. Just be sure to make the circle really round. This will help to make your paper beret really look like a beret.

, The circumference of this circle should be the same as the head of the person you are making the beret for. Be sure to center the smaller circle correctly, so that the hole will be placed accurately.


Once drawn, cut out the inner circle. You will not be using the inner part of the circle at all, only the outside, so you can damage the inside but don't damage the outside while cutting.

, You can do this in a variety of ways.


Try gluing the two layers together. You can use simple school glue for this method.
Sew the two layers of paper together with a needle and thread or with you sewing machine. You will need to be very careful, so that the paper doesn't rip, but the thread makes a nice decorative element.
You could also put double-stick tape between the two layers, being careful to keep it as near to the edge as possible.

, While traditional berets did not have a lot of color or sparkle, who says that your cool paper beret can't? Make the beret your own with a signature design.


Add a little sparkle to your beret with a glitter glue design or a few colorful stickers!
Try making a bunch of paper berets for a french themed party for kids. The kids could decorate the berets themselves and then wear them for the rest of the day.

, While it may not last forever, this fun crafted beret can really make a colorful statement on your head.

Mark the spots on the pillow with a pencil where your chest, waist and hips are, according to the measurements you've just taken.

, This may be challenging to get through, but it is worth the patient effort required. The end result should be shaped a little like a human torso.

, This is to check that you've pinned the pillow in accurately. If the measurements don't match your initial ones, then keep adjusting with the safety pins. If it matches, move on.

, Safety pin it to be the shape the pillow was. Then, insert the pole behind the pillow and there should be a bump sticking out of the top of the pillow; this is now the neck.

Pre-wash the fabric.,
Cut a piece of fabric to measure 70 inches by 45 inches (1.78 m by 1.14 m).

,
Cut a 9-inch (22.86 cm) square from each corner of the fabric.

,
Fold the fabric over diagonally, with right sides facing each other, and pin the 9-inch (22.86 cm) sides together to form the first corner of the crib sheet.,
Fold and press under the edges all the way around the entire crib sheet.,
You will need 4 feet (1.22 m) of elastic, cut into 4 1-foot (.3 m) lengths.,
Sew the elastic to the remaining 3 corners of the crib sheet.

Seek to make an invisible join where possible.,
Overlap the lace.,
Treat very wide lace slightly differently.",How to Join Lace End to End," This will make the lace appear as if it is running on and on without a break, which is ideal for items such as bags and stuffed toys. It won't always be possible but it's the first preference.;
, The most common method for joining lace end to end is to overlap the ends and then over-sew the edges.


Turn the cut ends of the lace under if they're more than an inch (2.5cm) wide, before sewing.

, Where the lace is wider (2.5"" to 6"" / 6-15cm), cut around the lace pattern with care on both ends of the lace and stitch together using stick-on adhesive to keep in place, as is done with wedding lace motifs. That way you can be sure it won't shift during sewing and the join will be perfect.

Trim any loose strings.",How to Make a Faux Fur Blanket," Making a faux fur blanket is a simple process, but it does require some special tools and materials. To make a faux fur blanket, you will need:2 to 3 yards of faux fur
2 to 3 yards of fleece
Lots of pins
Scissors
Exacto knife for cutting faux fur fabric (optional)
A sewing machine;
, Lay the faux fur down on a clean, dry surface with the fur facing up. Then, lay the fleece directly over the faux fur. Make sure that the edges of both fabrics are lined up. If the fabric pieces are not the same size, then just line up as many edges as you can.Keep in mind that if you want to use faux fur for both sides of the blanket, then you can. However, it will cost more for the extra faux fur fabric.If using faux fur for both sides, then lay the two faux fur pieces so that the fur sides are facing each other.
Other backing fabric options you might use in place of fleece include flannel, satin, cotton, microfiber, and jersey. Just make sure to place the right side (print or texture side) so that it is facing towards the faux fur fabric.

, Use your scissors to trim either the fleece or faux fur if necessary. It is important for the two pieces to be roughly the same size.Don’t worry too much about a slight difference in the size of the two fabrics or jagged edges. These will be hidden on the inside of the blanket when you sew it.
If you need to cut the faux fur fabric, then it is best to do so on the back side (non-furry side) of the fabric and use an exacto knife. This will make it easier to avoid cutting through the fur and ending up with stray hairs everywhere., To ensure that the edges stay lined up, you will need to use pins.Pin all the way around the edges of the blanket except for a roughly 16” section extending from one of the corners.Be sure to use lots of pins to hold the two pieces of fabric together! Place a pin at least every 8 inches along the edges.

, Sew a straight stitch about ½ inch away from the edge of the blanket. Remove the pins as you go and return them to a pin cushion or magnetic pin holder.Hold the fabric firmly, but do not stretch it out as you sew. Just try to keep it flat and even. Sew at a slow, steady pace.
Try to avoid getting any fur in the seam. Brush it away from the edges with your fingers if necessary., You should have left a 16” area of the fabric unpinned. This area will serve as the gap through which you can pull the blanket through and invert it. Stop sewing when you reach this area.Lift the needle and presser foot so that you can pull the fabric away from the sewing machine. Then, begin inverting the blanket so that the faux fur is on the outside. Keep pulling the fabric through the gap until it is totally inverted.
You may need to push out the fabric at the corners a bit to ensure that they don’t look lumpy. Use your fingers or a small object to gently push the fabric out at the corners of the blanket., To complete the blanket, you will just need to sew up the gap. Fold the edges under so that the raw edges will be hidden, and then begin to pin them to hold them in place. Then, sew over the area about ½” from the edge.Remove the pins as you go.
Be sure to place the pins in a pin cushion or magnetic pin holder as you remove them.

, There may be a few hanging threads left over when you finish working on your blanket, so be sure to trim these away. Snip any loose threads as close to the edge of the blanket as you can get without cutting the fabric.


After you trim away the loose ends, your blanket is ready to use!

Wrap the mix tightly and let rest 24 hours.,
Check consistency.",How to Make Cold Porcelain1," Use a microwave safe bowl.;
, Alternatives are listed in the ingredients section. Keep mixing until there are no lumps present.


Lemon juice is not vital for consistency but is strongly recommended as it inhibits the growth of mold.

, Microwave it for 15 seconds at a time, taking it out to stir in between. Depending on the power of your microwave, this should take somewhere between three and nine 15-second intervals.The mixture will form clumps as it cooks. Try to stir in as many of these as possible between microwaving.
The mixture is ready when it is sticky and very clumpy. This will be easier to judge once you see how your first attempt ends up.
It's better to make an undercooked batch than an overcooked one, since the former is easier to salvage.

, This will prevent sticking. Feel free to prepare the work surface during the microwave intervals.

, Immediately remove the hot dough-like mixture from the bowl and begin kneading it.


It will usually take 10 to 15 minutes for the mix to cool to room temperature.Knead the mix for this entire period.

, Use plastic wrap to make an airtight seal around the cold porcelain mix. Store it in a cool, dry place for 24 hours.


You can coat the plastic wrap with lotion to prevent sticking.
To make an easy airtight wrap, shape the mix into a log and roll the plastic wrap around it. Twist each end.
The refrigerator is a fine place to store the mix, but any location out of direct sunlight, heat, and moisture is fine.

, After a day of rest, remove the cold porcelain and see how it turned out. It should now be ready to use.


Take a piece of the cold porcelain and tear it apart gently. A well made batch will form teardrop shapes as it stretches and breaks.If the inside of the clay feels sticky, knead in additional corn starch.
If the cold porcelain is brittle or dry, it was probably overcooked. You can try adding a little more oil, or make an undercooked batch and knead the two together afterward.

, It should look similar to ricotta cheese when finished., Wait until it cools down enough to handle it, then knead continually until it reaches room temperature.

, Using a ziploc bag or plastic wrap, store the mix in a cool, dry location away from direct sunlight.

, After that point you can adjust the consistency by kneading in additional oil or cornstarch to correct overly brittle or sticky dough (respectively).

Knead in acrylic or oil paint.If you'd like to make a colored porcelain, knead the color of your choice in thoroughly before you begin.,
Knead each piece before you shape it.,
Shape the clay into the desired shape.,
Attach pieces using water.,
Use a base for large pieces.,
Leave the result to dry.,
Seal your sculpture.",How to Make Cold Porcelain3,"


You can add paint during the initial kneading while making the cold porcelain, but this will reduce its shelf life.

, Every time you use a new piece of clay, knead it first to increase its elasticity.

, Well made, kneaded cold porcelain should be easy to sculpt and capable of forming delicate designs.

, To attach two wet pieces of cold porcelain, press them together and smooth over the joint with a wet finger.


Dry pieces can be glued together using ordinary white glue.

, Cold porcelain shrinks significantly as it dries, and a large piece may not dry sufficiently all the way through. Instead, cover a different material with a layer of the clay.

, Cold porcelain requires no additional cooking and will harden simply when exposed to air.


How long this takes depends greatly on the size of your sculpture, the temperature, and the humidity of the air. Keep checking until it is hard.

, Without a seal, your cold porcelain art will be vulnerable to ""melting"" in heat or water, although you should still keep sealed art in a cool dry place when possible.There are many types of sealant and lacquers intended for clay, with various glossy or matte finishes. Clear acrylic sealer is a simple transparent option.

1 1/4 cup flour
1 1/4 cup salt
1 tablespoon cream of tartar
3/4 cup warm water
1 tablespoon cooking oil;
, Use a spoon to mix the ingredients well.









In a variation of this recipe, you can cook the dough in a saucepan. To do this, instead of pouring the the ingredients into a mixing bowl, put them in a saucepan., Pour a small amount of the warm water into the bowl and start mixing the mixture with a spoon. It should start clumping together as you mix.









For the cooked variation, add the water and the oil into the saucepan. Turn the stove eye on low, and continue cooking on low and stirring until the dough has thickened. This may take a few minutes.

, Keep pouring the water in as you mix the batter. Soon the ingredients will form a sticky dough.









Many factors affect the consistency of the clay, like humidity in the air and the type and brand of flour being used. If your clay is too watery, add a little more flour. If the clay is too sticky, add a little more flour. If the clay is dry and flaky, add a little water.Add it in very small measures and knead the dough a little. Repeat the process until you think your clay has the right consistency.

, When the clay gets too tough to mix, add cooking oil to make it softer. Don't add too much, or it will affect the consistency of the dough and make it harder to mold.









Add a few drops of food coloring to give the clay some color. You can also separate the clay into several pieces and color each one separately for differently colored pieces. Knead the color in with your hands. It may appear marbled at first, but will soon evenly distribute.

, After the dough is finished thickening, sprinkle some flour on the counter. Knead the dough on the counter until it is a smooth, stretchy consistency.









You can also use a rolling pin to flatten the dough.
You can knead the dough and add food coloring to the dough made in the saucepan variation. Just make sure the dough is cool before you start kneading so you don't burn your hands.

, After the dough has been kneaded, shape the clay into different sculptures. If you have colored separate sections of dough different colors, knead them into shapes and then place them next to one another to build elaborate crafts.









Use toothpicks to decorate the clay with holes. You can make eyes, noses and other features.
Use cookie cutters to cut out different shapes, or use cookie presses to stamp the clay.
Sprinkle the sculptures with some glitter and gently press it into the clay before baking.
Take a key ring with a small chain attached and press the end of the chain into the clay. Press more clay around it so that it's secured inside the sculpture.

, Place the sculptures on a baking sheet. Make sure none of them are touching or they might fuse. Put the baking sheet of sculptures in the oven. Bake them for 20 minutes, or until the dough is nice and hard. Remove the sculptures from the oven and let them cool completely.









Since the clay you made is basically a dough, it can be baked in the oven until it becomes very hard. Make sure to watch it in case the sculptures start to burn. Baking the sculptures you molded will preserve them for years.

, Use poster paint, glitter glue, and other fun craft supplies to paint and decorate the sculptures you have made. You can seal with a coat of clear varnish once the paint has dried. This adds a shiny finish to your clay objects.

A piece of tile or glass works well for the hard, flat surface.
Instead of the toothpick, you can also use an electric drill with a one-eighth-inch drill bit to drill holes in the beads.;
, To create uniform beads that are all the same size, cut off a one-inch (25 mm) slice of clay and roll it out into a sheet that’s one-eighth inch (three mm) thick. Use a shape cutter to punch out chunks of clay that are all the same size.If you want beads that are different sizes, you can either use cutters in varying sizes, or simply cut chunks of clay from the block using your eye to measure. The great thing about homemade beads is that you can make them any size, shape, or design you like!

, Work the chunks of clay in your hands by rubbing each one between your palms. Conditioning helps to warm the clay, gets rid of cracks, and makes the clay more pliable and easier to shape and handle.Always wash your hands before rolling white clay to avoid transferring dyes or colors to it., To create spherical beads, roll each bead individually between your palms to shape them into spheres. You can also make them more ovoid, roll them into cylinders, or shape them into cubes or other shapes.


Always shape beads on a hard, flat surface.

, Stick all your beads in the fridge for 10 to 15 minutes. This will allow the clay to firm up, which will make it easier to punch holes in them., In order to be able to string your beads, you have to poke a hole in each one before it’s baked. With a toothpick, create a hole through the center of each bead. Don’t push the bead into the toothpick or shove the toothpick through the bead, as this will warp the bead. Instead:


Screw the toothpick into the bead by rolling it between your fingers as you apply gentle pressure. Once you’ve worked the toothpick all the way through, pull it out and reinsert it through the other side to clean up the hole.If you are going to use a drill to create holes after baking, skip this step and move on to baking.

, A cane is a log of clay with a design that runs through the center. When the cane is sliced into discs, each disc has the same design in the middle. Canes come in various shapes, such as cylindrical, cubic, triangular, and star-shaped.Choose three different clay colors and cut off a half-inch (12 mm) slice from each block. Roll them all into individual cylinders of the same width and length.Place the three cylinders together in a triangular log and twist the colors together. The more you twist, the more variation there will be in the cane.
Roll the log back into a cylinder, and use your knife to slice off discs. Use the discs to create your beads.

, You can buy cane that’s already got designs woven in, and this cane can be laid over top of a bead mold to create unique and intricate beads. For the bead molds, you can either roll your own basic beads as before (don’t poke holes just yet), or you can use wooden beads for a more lightweight finished product. Refrigerate the cane for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing it.


Cut slices from the cane that are about the thickness of a nickel. The number of slices you need for each bead will depend on the size of the bead and the design you’re going for. Warm the slices in your hand and arrange them around the bead mold.
Gently roll the wrapped bead around in your hand to seal the seams together. You can also use a knitting needle to roll the seams and seal the cane joints.
When you have sealed the seams, shape your bead and poke the holes.If you used a wooden bead as the mold, poke small holes in the cane to access the hole that’s already in the wooden bead.

, Form your chosen clay into spherical balls by rolling it between your palms. On a hard, flat surface, place the ball between two layers of parchment paper. Use another hard, flat surface, such as a small sheet of acrylic or a stamp block, to apply even pressure to the clay. Press the clay until it forms a disc that’s about one-eight inch (three mm) thick. Refrigerate for 10 to 15 minutes.


Once the clay has firmed up, remove it from the parchment paper and use your toothpick to poke a hole in each disc., Making a bead pendant is a combination of the basic bead and the cane bead process. Start by slicing a half-inch (12 mm) block of clay. Condition it by rolling it around in your hands. Roll it out into a sheet that’s about one-eighth inch (3 mm) thick.


Then, decorate that slab with slices from your desired cane designs, just as you did when you were decorating your bead mold.Use your hands to apply even pressure and press the cane into the clay beneath. Use a roller or knitting needle to join the seams of the cane together.
Use a cutter to punch out your desired shape. You can also use a sharp knife to cut out a custom design. When you have your shape, punch a hole in the pendant.

, Alternatively you could use a bead roller. Measure out you clay using the guide included, then follow the instructions for many identical beads., No matter what kind of beads, pendants, or discs you made, they must be finished with baking. This will set the clay so that the beads maintain the shapes and designs you’ve created. Always preheat your oven before baking, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding baking times and temperatures. To bake your beads, you can:


Arrange them on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
Place the beads on a length of firm, straight wire. Then, suspend the wire from an oven-safe baking dish and bake the beads like that.Once your baking time is up, remove the beads from the oven and allow them to cool completely before handling them.

, In case you chose not to poke holes in your beads before baking, now’s the time to create the holes. Work with each bead individually. Hold a bead steady on a hard surface with your thumb and forefinger. With your other hand, use the drill to carefully drill a hole through the center of the bead., Use a 400-grit (or higher) wet/dry sandpaper to remove any blemishes or fingerprints., Since polymer clay forms a nice, durable finish when it cures, sealing your beads isn’t necessary.However, if you choose to seal your beads, use a clean brush to apply a thin layer of polyurethane varnish to each bead. Allow them to dry before creating your jewelry.

Try an alternate no saucepan, no-bake recipe.,
Shape the clay into figures.",How to Make Modelling Clay at Home2," For this no-bake clay recipe, you will need the following ingredients:









2 cups baking soda
1 ¼ cup water
1 cup cornstarch

, In a saucepan, combine the baking soda and cornstarch. Slowly add the water into the mixture. Continue stirring the mixture while heating it over medium heat. This should take about 4-5 minutes.








The mixture will start thickening up quickly. When it is almost the same consistency as playdough, the clay is done.

, When the clay has reached the appropriate thickness, remove the saucepan and pour the mixture onto a clean surface. Cover with a dishtowel until cool.









You may have to spoon out the mixture if you can't get it to pour from the saucepan.
Once the dough has started to cool, knead it until it's thin and smooth. You can also use a rolling pin.

, If you'd like a variation of the no-bake clay that doesn't require any cooking, use this recipe instead.









Gather the following ingredients: 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup salt, and 1/2 cup cornstarch.
Mix the ingredients in a mixing bowl. Slowly add warm water until the clay mixture starts becoming hard.
Sprinkle flour on a clean surface, and place the clay on top of it. Knead the clay.

, The clay should be easily shaped into different shapes. If it gets a little too hard, add a tiny bit of water.Allow the shaped clay to dry overnight before painting.








Paint the figures using acrylic paint or other types of craft paint. Add glitter, accents, or other craft accessories to your figures and shapes.
To change the color of the clay, add food coloring to the clay. Separate the clay into different sections to make different colored clays.
You can seal the clay when you're finished by adding a clear coat, such as shellac, acrylic spray, or clear nail polish.

Get the proper clay.,
Put the clay on the center of the wheel head.,
Using both hands firmly against the spinning clay, pull it into a conical shape.,
Centering the clay means that its outer edges spin perfectly smooth with no bumps or wobbles.,
Once the clay is centered, it is time to open it.,
To enlarge the hole, put your finger into the hole you've already created and slowly start bringing it towards your body.,
Compress the bottom.,
The next step is to thin and raise the walls.,
Even out the top.",How to Throw a Pot," After obtaining the desired clay, either high fire clay (porcelain, balconies, etc.) or low-fire clay (raku, longhorn red, etc.)you need to knead or wedge the clay to get out air bubbles. Gather a small amount of clay - the size of two fists put together is plenty for someone just starting - and form it into a rough ball shape. Then pick the ball up, and slam it against a large slab of plaster. Plaster is best to absorb extra moisture from too-wet clay, but any smooth and hard surface will work. Push the clay with your hands forward in the same manner of kneading bread. Mold it into a ball, and repeat the process. To see if there are still air bubbles, use a piece of wire to cut the ball in half. The air bubbles will look like little craters in the smooth clay. If air bubbles are left in the clay the clay will almost never be centered and impossible to raise. When there are no air bubbles present in the clay, shape it back into a rough ball.;
, The easiest way to do this is by throwing the clay with some force on the center. Spin the wheel fairly fast. With a bowl of water wet hands and clay. The object here is to cup the clay in the hands, squeeze it using legs for extra strength, and bring it up into a tower shape. If you're using a kick wheel, you can control how fast the clay will spin, but you'll need a lot of strength. An electric wheel takes less energy, but you have less control over the speed. Push the clay down and in on the wheel at the same time, letting extra clay and water slide away from your hands and off the wheel. The first thing you want to do is called centering the clay. The ball of clay should look even, and be rotating evenly, like the wheel of a car when viewed from the side.

, Then push your tower down with one hand and keep it stable with the other hand. This is done three or four times to help center the clay and to keep the clay aligned correctly.

, There are different ways of doing this, and there are two methods described here. Use whichever one will work best. The beginning is the same for both methods. Make sure your body is centered over the wheel and legs are planted firmly on the ground.


Make sure that your arms are firmly in position and pressed into your thighs. Start by cupping the clay in both hands with your thumbs over the top. Make sure that your hands and the clay are always wet. Pull your wrists back slightly while pressing down and holding them rigid. Start compressing and smoothing the clay with your palms. Only do slight movements, a little pressure goes a long way.
The second method for centering clay is by using one hand at the side of the clay and one hand on top. Both are pushing on the clay to smooth it out. Again, only use your palms and keep your arms locked against your body.

, To start you need to make a hole in the center. To do this, start by moving your finger across the top of the clay in a straight line. This is so you find the exact center. If the hole is not started in the exact middle, the clay will begin to wobble and you will have to follow the steps above to recenter it. Slowly push your forefinger straight down into the center of the spinning clay, about an inch from the bottom, using the other hand to cup the clay and act as a stabilizer at the same time. Slowly remove your finger from the hole.

, You will need to use your other hand to brace the wall that is being created. Enlarge this to the size of the base you wish your pottery to be. This created wall would generally be about an inch to two inches thick. With the wall created, the cylinder should spin perfectly symmetrical. In all these steps always remove hands and fingers and take the pressure off slowly.

, After you have created an opening the bottom will need to be compressed. To do this you can either use a wooden rib to take out all the off-center clay from the bottom or you can slowly smooth it out with your fingers. The former method will create a flat bottom.

, Usually the index finger of the first hand is braced against the inside wall toward the bottom, with the thumb braced across to the second hand or wrist. Because by now the clay is thoroughly soaked with water, a very small, say one inch sponge is held between index finger and thumb of the second hand The index finger and sponge are pressed against the outside wall exactly opposite the finger(s) on the inside. They are squeezed and raised together, thinning the wall and raising the pot. This is done a little at a time from say 6 to 12 times, until the desired thickness of the wall is achieved, from an eighth of an inch to an inch depending on the type of pot or plate. The object is usually to thin the wall to the point where it still has the strength to stand up. The sponge is used to control the wetness and strength of the clay, the more wet the weaker, the less the stronger.

, The top often becomes uneven and can be cut off at any time, but especially after the walls are finished. With a pin projecting from a wood cylinder bought at a ceramics shop, with the first hand press the pin into the spinning clay near the top, or cut off where desired. Press into spinning clay until it reaches the index finger of the second hand on the inside. When completely cut all the way around, simply lift up and off. This is a basic cylinder.

You’ll be working with acrylic paint, which is water-based and pretty easy to clean if you do spill.Who wants to clean though?


On that note, you should probably change into some work clothes too.
It is preferable to set up your painting station somewhere out of the way, because it takes several days to fully complete a pot. The primers, paints, and sealers all need hours to dry, so set up your supplies somewhere you can leave them for at least 48 hours.;
, This will help you peel off any price tags, as well as clean off any marks.Because these pots are often sold at home and garden stores, they might be slightly scuffed or dirty. It’s important to give yourself a clean terracotta canvas before you start your painting.

, You can easily dry it by setting it in the sun for a couple hours. After it’s completely dry, take a piece of sand paper and lightly rub any rough areas or markings on the pot. The sandpaper can also remove any residue left behind by a price tag or sticker. If your pot is already clean and smooth after its bath, feel free to skip this step!


Surface impurities on your pot will show through the paint, so make sure it’s as clean and smooth as you can possibly get it.
The color of the terracotta will help you tell if it is dry. The pot will be significantly darker when wet, and lighten up as it dries., Terracotta is a porous surface,so priming the pot is an important step. The primer will prevent the paint from bubbling or looking speckled,and it will give your pot an overall smooth and polished appearance. There are various kinds of primers with different instructions, so follow the instructions on the packaging. Cover all areas of the pot that you are going to be painting. Spray the areas you aren't going to be painting (such as the inside of the pot and the bottom) with the waterproof sealant. Make sure the primer and sealant are completely dry before you begin painting.


Most primers are a plain white color, but feel free to tint them with your background paint color if you prefer. Tinting them with a darker color may be useful if you want your finished pot to be dark., If you want to use multiple colors for your background, it’s helpful to tape off the sections before starting. Place tape where you want a color of paint to end. You can then paint the color and peel off the tape, leaving a perfectly clean line. Allow your background to dry, preferably overnight.You may need to apply several coats of paint, particularly if you are using light colors. After your first coat of paint is completely dry, you can decide if you need one or two more. Always a coat to dry completely before adding another.
By letting them dry in the sun, it’ll speed up the process and you’ll air out the paint smell!

, Once your background coat of paint is completely dry, you can start painting on top. The possibilities are limitless. You can use stencils, create designs using tape, or even try your luck at free-handing something! Stamping the terracotta pot with stamps creates an interesting design. Just get creative! When you are all finished, allow the pot to dry completely.


This step, of course, is optional. You can always leave your pot one solid color, depending on the look you are going for.

, This is a crucial step, because the pots can peel, fade, and chip if you don’t seal the paint properly. Make sure you are somewhere with good ventilation, and spray the pot thoroughly with an acrylic sealer. It goes on clear, so it won’t mess up your painting.Spray until you think you’ve covered the entire surface of the pot, and then spray it again. You want to make sure you don’t miss an inch- even areas that you did not paint. The unpainted areas are still vulnerable to moisture, and if damage to unpainted areas can affect your beautiful painted areas! The sealant dries pretty quickly, but you should let your pot sit for a couple of days before you expose it to any moisture. This will ensure that everything is completely sealed and protected., This will save you time, and it will also give your pot a really unique look. Play around with the distance between the pot and the spray paint, seeing the different spray patterns and intensities you can create. Use an acrylic spray paint, and make sure you do this in a well-ventilated area.

, It's best to use a material like poster board to create your stencils, so that it is thick while still being malleable enough to bend it against the surface of the pot. You can create a stencil of anything you want as long as you have the proper materials.


Print off whatever image you want to use for your stencil. This can be an image, a letter, a design, etc. Tape the printed paper to the poster board, and use an X-Acto knife or other razor blade to cut it out., Using wood glue, you can add anything your heart desires. For a rustic look, you can add little twigs, pebbles, twine, fake leaves, and anything else you can think of. For a flashier look, try gems or other sparkly objects., A fully painted pot looks great, but leaving portions of unpainted terracotta showing through can provide a neat contrast. It will be recognizable as an ordinary, every day terracotta planter, but with a little extra pizzazz. This looks great when the pot is positioned with unpainted terracotta pots, as it ties the arrangement together.

, You can use duct tape to create bold, straight-edged designs, and you can also free hand with your paint to create gentle, flowing patterns. You can create a one-of-a-kind pot by using both kinds of designs on one pot!

First make sure you know what cone your bisque ware has been fired to.,
Select a soft paintbrush.,
Rinse your bisque ware quickly under cold water to remove dust and other impurities that may cause glaze defects.,
If you have a banding wheel, use it!

,
Stir your glaze thoroughly with a clean fork.,
Glaze the inside first.,
Turn the pot upside down on the banding wheel and paint 3 coats over the outside.,
After the glaze is dry enough to handle, then turn it right side up and paint the rim with 2-3 coats and touch up any missed areas.

,
Let the pot dry and wipe off the bottom with a damp sponge prior to firing.

,
Fire it to the correct cone.

,I usually have an assembly line of pots that I glaze this way, except that I layer multiple colors for interesting effects.,Experiment and make test tiles for more predictable results.,
Keep a notebook so that you can remember combinations of glazes that works and doesn't work.

,
Always use lead-free glazes.,

Have fun, I personally love glazing by brushing, to me it is more exciting and personal that dipping in large vats of glaze.",How to Paint Pottery," Choose a glaze that is made for that cone level!;
, Some people prefer large, flat Chinese wash brushes. Make sure the brush is clean!

, Do not dry it, it will dry on its own fairly quickly. Besides, a little dampness will help the glaze go on more smoothly.

,, Then make sure the lid is on tightly and shake it up.

, Pour some glaze into the bowl or pot and swirl it around so that it covers the entire inside, then pour it back into the bottle. If the inside has holes or the shape is not conducive to this method, then paint 3 coats on the inside. If you are pouring it in, you only need ONE COAT. Do not bother painting the rim yet....

, Try not to get any glaze on the bottom of the pot. If it is high fire clay and glaze (cone 3 or higher), then leave at least 1/4"" before the bottom of the pot unglazed. Some people use wax.

,,,,,,, Read the labels!

, You just paint enough to cover and fire them on, then clear glaze them with 2-3 coats of transparent glaze and fire them again.

, Just make sure you have about 3 coats of glaze for the best results. Too little and the results will be streaky and not shiny, too much and it will run and drip and ruin your pots and shelves.

Plug it in, and set the temperature to low. That will allow the slow cooker to heat up slowly.While children can help with the measuring and mixing of the ingredients, an adult should handle preparing and heating the slow cooker.;
, Add 2 cups (250 g) of flour, 1 cup (128 g) of cornstarch, 1 cup (300 g) of salt, and ¼ cup (41 g) cream of tartar to the slow cooker’s bowl. Use a wooden spoon or whisk to ensure that they’re well blended.All-purpose flour works fine for the clay, but if you want to make a gluten-free version, use rice flour.

, After you’ve mixed the dry ingredients in the slow cooker, pour in 2 cups (473 ml) of hot water and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of canola oil. Stir the mixture well to ensure that all of the dry ingredients are fully incorporated.You don’t need to use boiling water. Turn the tap on your sink to hot and fill your measuring cup with water.
You can substitute any type of cooking oil for the canola. For example, vegetable, corn, and olive oils will all work well.

, Once all of the clay ingredients are mixed in the slow cooker, place the lid on it. Turn the heat up to high, and allow the mixture to cook for approximately 30 minutes.Placing a damp towel under the lid before you close the slow cooker can help the clay cook more quickly.

, After the clay has cooked for approximately a half hour, remove the lid and stir the mixture well. Close the slow cooker again, and allow the clay to cook once again.The clay can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to finish cooking. In most cases, the smaller your slow cooker, the longer the clay will take to cook.
If your clay forms a ball when you stir it after the first half hour, it’s finished cooking.

, If your clay hasn’t finished cooking after the first half hour, check on it in 30 minute intervals. Stir it after each half hour. When it easily forms a ball as you stir, it’s ready., Once the clay is finished cooking, remove the bowl insert from the slow cooker and stir it once more. Transfer the dough to a clean, flat surface, and allow it to cool for approximately 5 minutes.It’s a good idea to line your countertop or table with wax paper before you place the clay on it.

, When the clay is cool enough to handle, use clean hands to knead it. Continue working the clay until it is smooth, but pay attention to the texture to decide if you need to any more of certain ingredients.Be careful when handling the clay. It may still be hot.
If the clay is too sticky, sprinkle some cornstarch over it and knead the clay to mix.
If the clay is too dry, sprinkle some water over it and knead the clay to mix.

, Once the clay feels smooth, break it into several pieces. Decide how many pieces you need based on how many different colors of clay you want to make.For example, if you want red, blue, and yellow clay, divide it into three equal portions.
If you only want one color of clay, you can leave it as a single piece.

, After you’ve divided the clay into pieces, use a finger to poke a small indentation in the center of each. Next, add a few drops of food coloring in your chosen shade to each piece of clay.It’s best to start with a small amount of food coloring. If the clay isn’t as dark or bright as you’d like after you mix it, you can always add more.
If you’re using powdered food coloring to color your clay, you don’t necessarily need to poke a hole in the dough pieces. You can just sprinkle it over the clay mounds.

, After you’ve added the food coloring to the clay, use clean hands to knead it and mix the coloring in. Continue squeezing the clay until the color is evenly distributed. Once it’s properly colored, the clay is ready to play with.Store the clay in an airtight container to keep it from drying out. It will usually last for three to four months if stored properly.

Select the beads.,
Select the fabric to cover the beads according to your needs.,
Prepare the fabric.,
Cut the fabric into an even strip following the fabric template you've just made.,

Place a bead at one end of the glue-covered fabric strip.,
Repeat with another strip of glue-covered strip of fabric.,
Allow each bead to dry completely before using in jewelry making or craft projects.

,
Repeat with as many beads as you need for your project.

",How to Make Fabric Covered Beads," Most beads will work when covered, as long as they're not rough or precious. Choose the beads in sizes that are easy to cover; in other words, not too small and it's probably a good idea to avoid beads with odd shapes, as they may be harder to define after being wrapped in fabric.


You may want to vary bead sizes, depending on the design for your handmade jewelry.;
, This might be all the same fabric or a combination of fabrics––decide this by sorting out your design beforehand, then selecting the fabric accordingly.


Do you want the beads to match an outfit? In which case, select fabric that complements that particular outfit.
Avoid using distinctive patterns, loud colors or vibrant designs if you want the beads to go with a range of outfits. On the other hand, if you like an eclectic look, this may not be a problem.

, Measure the width of the bead. Use this measurement to make a fabric template that is slightly wider than each side of the bead and several lengths longer than the bead, each side. (The pieces need to be long enough to wrap around the bead.)


If using different sizes of beads, you'll need to make different templates for each size. Make a mark on the templates to make it easy to remember which template matches which beads.

, Repeat making strips for as many beads to be covered.

, Spread glue over the fabric strip.

, Roll the bead along, wrapping it with the fabric as you go. Smooth down wrinkles as you go, to prevent them from forming permanently.


If you need to keep the bead holes clear, stick a toothpick into the bead to help you avoid wrapping over the holes; when the toothpick is in the hole, it's easy to roll the fabric around the hole.

, This time, glue it to the bead in the same way, only align it slightly diagonally, so that it covers any uncovered part of the bead. Repeat with another glue-covered strip, aligning it again to ensure coverage. By now, the bead should be covered fully but if not, add another layer.

",How to Paint Clay Pots," Do this outside in the grass, if you can, to reduce cleanup. If you do it inside, or even in a garage, you may want to lay newspaper down so the dust doesn’t get everywhere. It’s also probably best to wear old clothes.


You don’t need to spend too long on this, just check for any bumps or especially rough spots. If you don’t see anything, then you don’t need to worry about sanding.
Even if the pot does have bumps, you have the choice of leaving them to add texture to the look after you paint it.;
, This is good for new pots because it will loosen any stickers for easier removal. It is also good for pots you have planted in before because it will loosen any dirt. If the pot has no stickers and you can tell for sure it is clean, it may be alright to skip the soak.Although you’ll have to leave the pot to dry at various stages in the process, while it soaks, you can use the time to gather your other supplies and set up your paint area.
If you don’t want to leave it for an hour, check it at 10 minute intervals and if it seems clean to your satisfaction, move forward with the process.

, While soaking the pot may loosen the dirt, used pots are likely to need a scrubbing to get them completely clean. The paint will not go on even or stick properly if there is any dirt or debris.


Your pots may need a soft brush so you don’t scratch them too much, but if there are any stubborn spots you can switch to a wire brush for extra strength.
If you happen to scratch the pot any while brushing it, there’s no need to worry because the paint will cover it and even it out.

, Painting the pot while it is still wet will cause the paint not to stick, so set it out to dry. If it’s a sunny day, put it outside to dry the pot faster. The time it takes to dry may depend on the size of the pot.


Drying may take a few hours, so plan ahead for this part so you don’t waste your time while you wait.

, If you are working inside on a table or counter, make sure you lay paper, a plastic sheet, or a drop cloth down to protect the surface from paint. Cover the area where the pot will sit and any area you might set paint down.If you are painting outside, you may still want to cover hard surfaces so the paint doesn’t stain anything.

, Doing this will keep you from smearing the paint while you hold the pot. You can balance the pot by putting a hand on the bottom (which will now be on top), because the bottom won’t be painted. Use something that is big enough to balance the pot.You can use a canning jar, a soup can, a peanut butter jar, or another cylindrical container. The size of jar you’ll need will depend on the size of the pot. If you are painting a large pot, this technique may not be an option.
This is not mandatory, but it is easier than holding the pot in your hands for the whole time as you paint.

, It’s easiest to use a spray sealer that’s meant for concrete or brick. Since clay pots allow water to soak through, this creates a barrier between the plant and the paint on the outside of the pot. Sealer is usually found in the paint section.It’s best to do this outside, or at least in a well-ventilated garage. Spraying this kind of product inside is not safe.
Drying may take up to 24 hours. Check the product instructions to be sure.
Seal the inside and outside of the pot. If you don’t seal the inside, when you water the plant the water will soak through the pot and can make the paint loosen and peel off.
If your pots are decorative and will not have real plants in them, it is not necessary to seal them.

, You can use colored primer if you want to, especially if you want it to work with the paint. Otherwise, a basic white primer is fine. This will help the paint stick to the pot better. Plus, primer helps cover the red color of the clay.Prime all around the outside, but also extend the primer at least an inch down the inside of the pot.
Although some sources say to paint the bottom, it’s best not to put any primer or paint on the bottom of the pot as this can affect proper drainage.

, Bristled brushes tend to leave streaks, so using a foam brush will give you a more even coat. You may want a couple brushes of different sizes, especially if you want to paint any kind of patterns on the pot.


If you have bristled brushes that you want to use, it won’t hurt anything. Foam brushes just work a little better. Bristled brushes are fine for small detail work later on.

, You can paint the pot one solid color, but for more variety or for fun designs, painters tape is a great option. With this variation, you’ll tape and paint over the tape for the first coat. Once the paint dries, you’ll take the tape off and paint the areas that were under the tape before.


You can re-tape over the areas you already painted so you keep the lines betweens colors sharp.
Another option is to paint the entire pot with the first color, and then tape the designs you want and paint again over everything so the parts under the tape will stay the original color.

, You can use any paint you want for the main coats. It’s cheapest to use leftover paint you already have around. Exterior or interior paints are both fine, as well as acrylic craft paint. Spray paint works well,too.Cover the entire outside of the pot, excluding the bottom. It’s not necessarily harmful to paint the bottom, but it can’t cause the pot to not drain as well as it should.
Also paint slightly down the inside because the soil will not go to the very top of the pot, and you most likely don’t want the clay to show.

, Depending on the paint, the color, and how thick your first coat was, you may want to apply more than one coat to get an even cover. Clay pots also tend to absorb some of the paint, so it’s likely that one coat won’t be enough.


Make sure that each coat is dry before you paint any addition coats. If the paint is not dry, new coats will pull the paint off of the pot.
You can use a different color for the second coat if you want to give the pot a shaded look. If you do this, you might want to thin the second coat with water so it is a little more see-through.

, Another option for further creativity is painting lines, shapes, or pictures on the pot. If you’ll use the pot for a plant with large foliage that hangs down, you probably don’t want to go into great detail.


This is where you can make the pot as simple or as detailed as you want. For example, you might want to paint a detailed garden scene or you might want to paint the name of the plant in fancy letters.

, Acrylic sealer will make sure the paint lasts longer without peeling or cracking. This is especially helpful if the pot will be outside in the elements. Wait to put the final seal coat on until all the paint has completely dried.This is not mandatory, but your paint job will most likely not last as long if you pass on sealing it.
You have lots of options when it come to sealants, but pay special attention if you will put the pot outside because not all sealants are meant for all weather.
Let the pot sit and dry for a few more days before you plant anything in it.

Form the shapes for your beads out of the Core Cork Clay.,





Using the ART CLAY SILVER Paste, apply first coat to the cork form.,

Keep layering on the paste and drying in between each layer until there is approximately 8-10 layers.,
If making the heart bead that has a filigree corner, don’t coat the entire bead.,
When you have completed coating your bead and it is completely dry give it a light sand with a very fine sandpaper.,
Decorate your bead.,
Using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe continue to decorate your bead.,
Once your bead is completely dry you are ready to fire it.,
Rinse your bead under cold water and rinse all the cork ash from the middle.,
Brush your bead with the stainless steel brush to remove clay residue.,
Burnish your bead using the burnisher.",How to Make Focal Beads With Art Clay Silver," Use toothpicks for where the holes will be. Ensure your shapes are completely dry before applying the ART CLAY SILVER paste. TIP: Make your shapes a few days before you make your beads. To dry out the cork completely place the shapes in the warmest place you can find, e.g the dash of your car is a good place. The shapes will feel very light when dry. (See image cork forms.)
, Use the hairdryer to dry paste in between each layer. (See image painting on clay paste)., This depends on how thick you are applying each layer. Bead should have a nice weighty feel to it. TIP: Make sure you keep your coats even. You don’t want thin areas as these may sink in when firing. Make sure you paint the clay right up to the toothpicks., Leave the area you want syringed uncoated. (See image Filigree heart), TIP: Don’t sand to much as you will thin the layers you have applied., This is where your imagination takes over. Using the syringe and the synthetic stones decorate your bead. To set the stones form a donut the size of your stone using the ART CLAY SILVER syringe. Place the stone onto the donut making sure it is sitting straight. Apply another donut using the syringe on top of the stone.(See image Setting Stone)., When you have completed decorating the bead use the hair dryer to completely dry your bead. TIP: To tell if your bead is dry place it on a small compact mirror. If there is condensation on the mirror then your bead is not completely dry. Continue drying until there is no condensation., Remove toothpicks from your bead before firing. If you are using a portable camp hotplate take it outside to fire as the cork gets very smoky when firing away. If firing indoors on your cook top have the range hood on hi and keep the room well ventilated. The cork will take a little longer to fire away than firing just clay. Approx. 5-10 minutes. (See image Firing)., You now have a hollow bead., (See image Brushing), This brings out the bright shine of the silver. On this heart bead I have only burnished the syringe work and left the remainder with the matte finish for contrast. (See image Heart Contrast)."

,,, Use a chisel to gently chip the seams off or sand them lightly with fine to medium grade sandpaper. This step is necessary for a smooth surface, and the paint will adhere better if you lightly sand it first., You can also blow off any dust and dirt with a hair dryer.

,,, A sealer will help prevent moisture from soaking through the pot, which could ruin the outside finish.

,, The primer helps the final coat of paint adhere and it covers any small imperfections or discolorations.

,, Use the best brush you can afford; the bristles on cheap brushes invariably come loose and get stuck in the paint.

Once you form your pot, you can easily cure the pot by baking it in your oven. However, polymer clay is not food safe. If you make a pinch pot out of this clay, you won’t be able to eat or drink out of it.Polymer clay can damage wooden or varnished surfaces in your home. If you choose to use this clay, cover your workspace with a towel or plastic bag.This clay can be purchased online or at a craft store.;
, Air-drying clay cures on its own without having to be baked in the oven or fired in a kiln. You can also paint a varnish onto the surface to make it safe for dry foods. However, this type of clay can’t be submerged or filled with a liquid as it will disintegrate.This clay can be purchased online, at a craft store, and at some professional pottery supply stores.

, If you want to make a durable, food and drink safe pinch pot, you need to use pottery clay. This kind of clay can be intimidating to beginners as you have to fire it in a kiln to cure it. However, many professional pottery supply stores also provide kiln services. Simply drop off your pottery, wait a few days, and pick it up again once it’s been fired.


Talk to a store representative to choose a particular clay and to learn about their firing services.
If you’re planning on glazing your pot to make it food safe, you will have to purchase a glaze as well. A store representative can help you choose the right glaze for your needs.

, Pull a tennis-ball sized chunk of clay away from your clay supply. Next, roll the chunk between your hands or against your work surface to form a ball.Keep the surface of the ball as smooth as possible.


Make sure you don’t create pockets in the surface of the ball by pressing with your fingers. Instead, use your palms to mold the ball.

, Cup the ball in your hand. Next, gently press your thumb into the center of the ball to create an opening. Leave at least 3/8 of an inch (1 centimeter) of clay at the bottom to form the base of the pot.









If you accidentally pinch through the base of the pot, roll the clay into a ball again and start over.

, Use gentle pinching motions to thin out the walls of the pot. Work in circles to thin out the sides at the same rate. Keep pinching until the walls are as thin as you’d like them. The walls of the pot should be similar in thickness without any large divots.Smooth out any cracks in the clay with your fingers after you’ve finished forming the pot.









While pinching, pay attention to the shape of your pot. Will it be a circular pot, a square-bottomed pot, or a long, tall pot?
The walls can be as thick as you’d like them. However, make sure you don’t make them any thinner than 3/8 of an inch (1 centimeter) or they will collapse.

, Set the pot in a low-traffic location and cover it with a lightweight hand towel. Let the pot dry for a few hours, checking on it periodically. When the pot is leather hard, it will be cool to the touch and firm like a block of cheese.If the pot starts to look chalky, it is getting too dry.

, Once the pot is leather hard, you can smooth the surface and add embellishments.Many potters prefer to use their fingers to smooth the surface of the pot, but you can also use specialized pottery tools such as wooden ribs. Additionally, you can even out the lip of the pot by cutting away any uneven areas with a craft knife. Other embellishments can include:


Using your fingers to smooth away any marks or cracks in the surface
Using a wooden stick to carve a pattern into the side of the pot
Scraping a serrated metal rib against the side of the pot to create a rough texture

, Let the pot become “bone dry.” During this stage, the pot will be rigid, brittle, and chalky. Polymer clay and pottery clay must be bone dry before you can bake it or fire it. Otherwise, it may melt or explode.









Be careful when handling a bone dry piece of pottery as it can break easily.

, Refer to your package of clay to see what temperature to set your oven to. Once your oven has preheated to the right temperature, place your pottery on a baking sheet and put it in your oven. Refer to the manufacturer instructions for cooking times and safety tips.


Some people believe that you shouldn’t bake polymer clay in your oven because it will leave a harmful residue. However, this is a myth.The baking sheet should not be used for food again once it’s been used for polymer clay.

, You don’t need to cure air-drying clay in the oven or in a kiln. Instead, place a lightweight towel over the pot and set it in an undisturbed location.Let it dry for five to seven days to allow it to completely harden before decorating it. If you paint the clay when it’s still wet, it won’t harden properly.


Once it’s dry, the clay will be chalky and firm.
It’s better for the clay to dry too long than too little.

, The firing process will cure the clay and make it rock hard. Once your pot is completely bone dry, carefully transport it to your local pottery supply store. These stores usually offer inexpensive firing services. You will be able to pick up your fired piece after a few days.


Make sure you tell the store employee the name of the clay you used as different clays are fired to different temperatures.

, You can use any kind of water-based paints, metallic pastes, chalk paint, or mica powders to decorate the surface of your pot. Once you’ve decorated it, seal the paint onto the surface of the pot with a sealing varnish.Polymer clay isn’t food safe, so you don’t have to worry about choosing food safe paints or varnishes.


Avoid using nail polish or oil based paints on your pot. They will dissolve the surface of the clay.
These materials can be purchased at most craft supply stores. For help finding them, talk to a store representative.

, Air dry clay can be decorated with latex and acrylic paints. If you’re planning on using your pinch pot to store or serve dried foods, you will need to varnish the surface of the clay. Purchase a food-safe professional varnish and apply four to five coats to the surface of the pot.Acrylic paints, latex paints, and food-safe varnishes can be purchased at craft supply stores. Talk to a store representative for help finding these items.
Follow the manufacturer instructions when applying the food-safe varnish. For example, some varnish manufacturers ask you to let the varnish dry twenty-four hours between coats.

, Once your pot has been fired in a kiln, you can decorate the surface however you’d like. If you’re not going to use the pot for food or drinks, you can paint the pot with acrylic, latex, or oil-based paints. Alternatively, glaze your pot to make it food and drink safe. This will require another firing in the kiln, so talk to a pottery store representative to learn about your options.


You will need to choose a glaze that has a similar firing temperature to your clay. Talk to a pottery store representative for help choosing a glaze.
Never glaze the bottom of your pot. This will make it stick to the kiln shelf and ruin it.

Roll up the beads.,
Done!",How to Make Cardboard Beads1," Take a pair of scissors and cut a sheet of corrugated cardboard into triangles of different widths. You can also experiment with others shapes and sizes. Ultimately you just need a long piece of cardboard that you can roll up.You can find colored pieces of corrugated cardboard that are smooth on one side and bumpy on the other at your local craft store.;
, Once you cut out your shapes, brush some mod podge onto the smooth side of the corrugated cardboard. The glue will help the bead hold its shape. Try not to apply too much glue and make the cardboard soggy.You can find Mod Podge or craft glue at your local craft store.

, One at a time, wrap your pieces of cardboard around a straw. Make sure that the smooth side is facing in and the corrugated (bumpy) side is facing out. The side with the glue needs to be on the inside to hold the bead together. Once the glue dries – usually about 20 seconds – you will have a bead. After the glue has dried, remove the straw from the bead. Repeat to make the rest of your beads.Be sure to glue and then wrap each bead one at a time. If you apply glue to multiple pieces of cardboard and then wrap them, the glue will likely dry on some before you wrap them.
You can wrap multiple beads on the same straw.

, You can now use your corrugated beads for your project.

Are you setting out to make a functional or non-functional piece of ceramics?,
Imagine the purpose, size, shape, and the color of the object you wish to make.,
Pick your clay.,
Decide which method will work best for your project.,
Form away.",How to Make Pottery1," Depending on your needs, a bowl might best be done on a pottery wheel, but a decorative clay piece is probably done best by hand. You can even make a clay sculpture as long as it is mostly hollow on the inside and you create a vent hole for air to go during firing.
, ""Pottery"" is a very vague term -- there are dozens of different ways you can go about making a creation. To achieve each product, different elements of the art must be considered. Visit a gallery which sells pottery and ask how it was done. You can also visit art supply stores and discuss the best materials to use for the results you want, cost, firing, glazes, or a beginner's class. See what resources are out there to help you pick what your end product will be.


Start thinking. If you want to stick to small objects, beads, soap dishes and other slab methods are best. A decorative box might be tricky because you have to know when the clay is dry enough to stand up to make the box. You must use slip, a 50% mix of water and clay, that you use like glue. The edges of the clay need to be scored or roughed up with a stick before you apply the slip and then sealed together with your fingers. Animals can be fun to make, but the legs often cause difficulty. Think of animals that can sit. The sky is the limit with vases, plates, pots, dinnerware, and wall decorations.

, Once you know what you are going to make, you'll be able to choose your material. Air dry doesn't even have to be fired. But it's a bit expensive, so you might want to stick to smaller creations. Fimo clay is baked in a regular oven and already comes in various colors which can be blended together. Otherwise, there's low-fire or high-fire clays, and they warrant different results.


Low-fire clays are great for bright colors and detailed decoration. But they're not super good in water, so if you do go for low-fire clay, get a glaze that you know will seal 'er up.
High-fire clays aren't so great with bright colors, but they're sturdy, waterproof, and can be texturized easily. Glazes may move when fired, so detailed images could get blurred., You have a few options to choose from:


Potter's wheel: Best for bowls or plates, vases or anything you need to be symmetrical and round, It takes a lot of practice to get really skillful at this. It also requires a kiln and knowledge of firing and glazes. It's good for large and small objects, but again it is tough to rework if mistakes happen initially.
Pinching by hand: Best for small objects. The method is fairly straightforward: Start off with a small amount of clay that you can work with in your palms. Mold it with pressure from your thumb and index finger and keep turning it in your other palm if you want it round, and keep the ""walls"" even. Use a damp sponge to smooth the surface.
Coiling: Best for hollow or non symmetrical objects. You can create an interesting texture or pattern by or coiling layers together. Instead of one block of clay, you simply pile or coils into a shape. They adhere together with slip and create one mass.
Slab making: Best for flat sided objects. You put the sides of the clay onto a form. Use a plastic bag so it won't stick or use a light coating of cooking oil. As it dries remove it from the original form, it will shrink and possible crack if left draped over a bowl but it will maintain its shape.

, This is up to you and your skill level. If you have a wheel, great. If you don't, there are ways around that. If you're brand new to pottery, seek out a professional or watch a few videos online; it's an art that requires skill, most definitely.


Some clays aren't able to be molded, shaped back into a ball, and molded again. So when you make your choices, be careful -- your clay may not be too keen on giving you a second chance.

, Talcum powder prevents the clay from sticking to your hands.

, Take the amount of clay you need. Try not to take excess, for it is air-drying.

, Using your palm, roll the clay into an even ball. See that its surface is smooth.

, Push your thumb into the center of the ball of clay, creating a small hole.

, As you pinch in deeper into the hole, Pinch up around the hole to create walls for the pot.

, Make sure the walls and base are all of an even thickness throughout. It is not going to look so good if the sides are of varying thickness.

, Have an appropriate height with respect to the width of the pot.

, Put your index and middle fingers into the pot, and using your thumb press the neck of the pot inwards to create a curvy neck. Balance it using the fingers inside.

, Pinch it out so that it points outside to create a wavy edge.

, Use a modelling tool if necessary. Don't leave out any rough edges around the pot.

, Keep the pot aside. Take three small fresh balls of clay. This is to make the bottom for the pot so that it can stand.

, Score and moisten the surface to be joined. Take the pot and roughen the bottom in order to attach the balls of clay. Roughening will make the attaching easier.

, Secure the pieces to the roughened part. Press it firm, but not too hard, for it can misshape the pot. Smooth around the joins with a modelling tool.

, The modelling part is done. I'm not sure about the time needed for it to dry, but you can always check.

, Once the pot has dried, get your paints. It's time to add some beauty. Try out metallic, pearl, or pearl metallic paints. They are the best for painting pots and things like that. Use colors gold, bronze or something in the that shade.

Done!",How to Make Cardboard Beads2," Open up the box along all of its seams and lay it out flat. Then take a pair of scissors and cut off the bottom and top tabs. You should be left with a rectangular piece of unbent cardboard.You can leave creased pieces of cardboard on the box if you are okay with some slight bumps in your beads.

, On the inside of the box (the side with nothing printed on it), use a ruler and mark your strips. Draw strips that are ¾ of an inch (2 cm) on one end and 1/8 (3.18 mm) of an inch on the other. Once you have drawn all of your strips, cut them out with a pair of scissors., Take the wide end of a cardboard strip and wrap it around a piece of 14 gauge wire. Then slowly coil the cardboard around the wire. Make sure that the cardboard wraps around itself evenly in the middle. Once you reach the end, apply a small dollop of white glue and hold it until it adheres.Repeat this step for each individual bead.

, Once you have wrapped all of your beads, apply a coat or two of Mod Podge. This will help the beads stay together. Once they are dry, the beads are ready to be threaded., You can now use your beads made from cereal boxes on your project.

",How to Make Cardboard Beads3," Take one cardboard box for a dozen eggs and tear it into small pieces. The pieces should be about ½-inch (1.27 cm) in size. Smaller pieces make molding your beads easier.One cardboard egg box will make about 40 beads. You can also use other types of cardboard boxes, like cereal or cracker boxes.

, Place your shredded pieces of cardboard in a medium-sized bowl. Then pour some boiling water into the bowl with the cardboard pieces. Let the cardboard and water sit for at least an hour.To save some time, place your water on the stove to boil while you shred the egg box.

, Once the water has cooled, work the soggy box with your hands. Mash and tear the mixture until it is soupy and the larger pieces are broken down. It should have a slightly runny texture when you are done.You can also use an electric blender to save some time.
Be sure to let the water cool before you mash the cardboard. You may seriously burn your fingers if you do not give it enough time.

, Pour the contents of the bowl into a sieve. Be sure to press out as much water as you can. The cardboard should be moist but firm.You should drain the mixture over the sink or into another bowl. Pour the excess water down the drain.

, Squeeze about 4 tablespoons (59.15 ml) of PVA glue into the wet cardboard. Mix in the glue with your hands. Make sure that the glue is completely worked in and that there are not any clumps of cardboard.You can find PVA glue at your local craft store.

, Pull off a small piece of paper mâché and shape it into a ball. You can roll it between your hands or between your hand and a flat surface. Shape the ball for about 30-seconds and be sure to smooth over and cracks. When you are done, the ball should be smooth and round.Repeat this process with the remaining paper mâché.

, Use a toothpick to poke a small hole in the middle of the bead. Then press a chopstick into the small hole created by the toothpick. Gently push the chopstick into the bead until it pokes out of the other side. Pat down and smooth any places where the paper mâché has cracked.Repeat this process for your remaining beads.

, Once you have finished making your holes, leave the beads in a warm place and let them dry overnight. It is important that the beads dry out completely before you do anything else with them. If you want them to dry out a little quicker, consider leaving them near a radiator or a space heater. However, if you dry them out too quickly, the beads may crack and fall apart., After the beads have dried, take a piece of fine-grain sandpaper and smooth the beads. One at a time, take the beads and gently rub them with the sandpaper, removing any bumps or rough spots. Rubbing gently will prevent you from making your beads misshapen.You can find sandpaper at your local hardware store.

, With a small paintbrush, apply a coat of white acrylic paint to the beads. Once that has dried, apply a second coat of acrylic paint in whatever color you want. The white primer coat helps the second coat of paint be more vivid.Repeat for each bead, painting different patterns on each.
You can find acrylic paint at your local craft or art supplies store.

, Place a bead on the end of the chopstick and spray it with adhesive. Then roll the bead in some embossing powder until it is completely covered. Finally, place the bead in front of a heat gun and turn it until the embossing powder melts and the bead is dry.You can find embossing powder and spray adhesive at your local craft store.
If you do not have embossing powder, you can also brush a coat or two of varnish onto each bead. You can find varnish at your local hardware store.

, Insert some PVA glue into the each end of a bead’s holes. Then insert a metal beard core into each hole. The bead cores will help prevent the beads from flaking and wearing out once you insert string into it.You can find bead cores at your local craft store.

, You can now enjoy your paper mache beads for your project.

Place the pottery in an electric kiln.,
Paint your object with glaze.,
Reheat the pottery to melt the glaze and seal your object.,
File down the bottom of your object.",How to Make Pottery2," Raise the temperature of the kiln to 850°F (455°C) for 12 hours. This will produce ""bisque"" or ""unglazed pottery."" This initial firing removes the physical and chemical water so that the piece can be glazed without returning to mud and breaking. Ranges of temperature are referred to as ""cones"" in the ceramics world.Allow the temperature to drop and remove the pottery 48 hours later after the temperature has completely cooled.

, Keep in mind that glaze will run. Cover the bottom of your pottery with wax to shield it from sticking to the kiln shelf itself. If you want more precise lines, paint with ""bisque stain"" and then cover with a clear glaze.


If your surface isn't smooth, use a 100 grit sandpaper or a kitchen paring knife edge to make it so. Then sponge the entire surface of the pot to remove any dust left from sanding to provide a clean surface for the glaze to adhere to.Glazing takes on a number of forms. You can dip, brush, sponge, or etch -- just to get the list started. Use wax to keep the bottom from getting glaze on it during firing. You can also buy glazes in liquid or dry form. If you want to be a real pro, eventually you can make your own.

, Depending on your clay, the size of the object, and the glaze, you may need a kiln that hits 2500° Fahrenheit (1148° C).


Overnight, warm up your kiln at very low heat. Spend two hours at low heat (an increase in temperature of no more than 200°F per hour) and then two hours at medium heat (an increase in temperature of no more than 300°F per hour). Finally, finish at high heat (an increase in temperature of 300 to 400°F per hour) until the required temperature has been reached.

, It may have rested on the bottom of the kiln in an awkward position, forcing it to lose its flat bottom. Smooth it so that it sits without wobbling on a surface such as a table or shelf.


Add felt onto the bottom of your object if you so desire. Then, admire your finished product!

The slender 1-inch (2.5cm) beads used in this method are made from 1-inch by 4-inch (2.5cm x 10cm) triangles, but 1/2-inch by 8-inch (1.27cm x 20cm) triangles would create fat 1/2-inch (1.27cm) beads. Cut accordingly..;
, Turn the triangle design-side down and apply a bit of glue to the pointy end. A glue stick or a tiny bit of liquid glue will do.

, Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle around itself using a dowel, toothpick, or bamboo skewer. For a symmetrical spiral, keep the triangle centered as you roll; for a more free-form look, allow the triangle to become slightly off-centered.


Roll tightly, especially if you want the beads to last. Try to avoid having space between the layers.

, If the bead doesn’t stay tightly rolled up, apply another dab of glue. Hold it for a moment to help the glue to set.

, Use a finish like Marvin Medium, ModPodge, Diamond Glaze, or a solution of one part clear-drying glue to two parts water. Let it dry thoroughly, making sure it doesn’t stick to anything. You might shove a toothpick into a pincushion or a piece of Styrofoam to allow it to dry completely. Add multiple coats for a glossier, longer-lasting finish.

, Wait several hours until your clear finish has set on the bead. Slide the bead off the end of the dowel. If it is well wrapped and glued, it will hold. If the bead begins to unravel, replace it on your skewer and add more glue and finish where necessary.

, Use the aforementioned directions to create as many beads as you would like to finish your project. Make several for jewelry pieces, or create a long string to use for decoration in your home."

Create more beads.",How to Make Paper Beads2," Cut long triangles from a piece of white printing paper. The base of the triangle will be the width of the bead and the longer the triangle is, the fatter the bead will become. 1-inch by 4-inch (2.5cm x 10cm) triangles will make slender 1-inch (2.5cm) beads, whereas 1/2-inch by 8-inch (1.27cm x 20cm) triangles would create fat 1/2-inch (1.27cm) beads. Cut accordingly.

, Draw on each cut-out with markers, pencils, or pens. Since the triangle will eventually be rolled onto itself, only the outermost edges and the last inch or two of the tip of the paper will be visible; these are the areas where you should focus your design. Play around with a few colors and design combinations as you go to see what looks best.


Color the tip of the triangle red and then alternate 1-inch (2.5cm) strips of orange and red marker down the outside edges; this would create a bead with a red center surrounded by orange and red stripes.
Color the tip of the triangle black, move down an inch, draw 1-inch (2.5cm) black strips on either outside edge, move down an inch, and repeat; this would create a zebra-striped bead with a black center.
Do not use washable markers, especially if you plan to glaze your beads; the colors will run.

, Turn each triangle design-side down and apply a bit of glue to the pointy end. A glue stick or a tiny bit of liquid glue will do.

, Starting at the wide end, roll the triangle around itself using a dowel or other slender cylinder. A rounded toothpick or bamboo skewer would work nicely as well. Keep the triangle centered as you roll, otherwise, your designs won’t display correctly.Roll tightly, especially if you want the beads to last. Try to avoid having space between the layers.

, Glue the tip of the triangle to the rolled paper. If the bead doesn’t stay tightly rolled up, apply another dab of glue.

, Use a finish like Marvin Medium, ModPodge, or Diamond Glaze. Let it dry thoroughly, making sure it doesn't stick to anything. Try putting your toothpick into a pincushion or a piece of Styrofoam to keep it from coming into contact with anything.

, When the finish has had time to dry completely, slide the bead off the end of the dowel. If it is well wrapped and glued, it will hold.

, For earrings or a bracelet, you might make only a few beads. For a necklace or other larger project, you'll need more.

",How to Make Paper Beads3," Before you add your varnish, use paint to create an additional decorative design along the outside of your beads. For extra texture, use puff paint which dries in a bubble-like form above the surface of the bead.

, To make your beads sparkly, use glitter glue or loose glitter over the surface of the paper. Add the glitter before your final coat of varnish to keep it from rubbing off as a result of wear and tear. Try adding several coats of glitter in different colors for a lovely rainbow effect.

, Don't thread the beads on string; use string to create a decorative pattern along the outside of the paper. Cut a small piece of colored thread and use glue to wrap the exterior of the bead with the string. Use several pieces of string for added color and texture.

, Use colored florists wire to thread the beads and create pretty spiral or geometric patterns around the outside. Run the wire through the middle of the bead, and then bend it to shape around the bead.

, Use a translucent nail polish or watered down paint to coat your bead in an additional color. Adding the glaze will create a light, semi-opaque layer of color over the paper. You can also use watercolor paints for this.,"

The smaller work surfaces help for moving projects around.For making pots, especially pots made from coils, it’s sometimes easier to work on a turntable on which your smaller work surface can be applied. That way, you can spin your project around as you coil.However, if you plan to use a turntable, you will put your clay or smaller work surface on the turntable after you have prepped all of your clay (base and coils) and are ready to start laying down the coils.Wax paper and foil can also function as work surfaces, but if you plan to be roll out any of your clay, the wax paper or foil needs to be taped down so it doesn’t move.For help on finding and deciding the right work space for your project, visit any craft store and ask one of the employees for some advice.;
, Near your work surface, you will need a small cup of water for slipping the clay, a clay needle tool for scoring, a soft piece of sponge for smoothing the clay surfaces, either a wooden or metal rib to help smooth out blending bumps in the clay, and a small roller to flatten your base.Keep these tools off to the side until you’re finished wedging the clay and are ready to use them.
Alternatively, you can use an ordinary kitchen fork to score the clay if you don’t have a clay needle tool., Rip off a chunk of clay from your clay bag that’s about the size of an orange.This will be the first piece of clay that you wedge, but depending on how big you want to make your pot, you may have to wedge a few more.

, Hold the chunk of clay with both of your hands and throw it onto your clean work surface from about 24” above.The surface of the clay that hits your work surface will be flattened from the impact. Peel the clay off of your work space, and again throw the clay to flatten a side.


Repeatedly throw the clay, focusing on turning and rotating the clay piece to flatten the sides and form a uniform cube.

, It’s important to wedge your clay before you start shaping it, because air bubbles in the clay will cause your piece to explode while drying in the kiln. Position the clay so one of the flat faces of the cube is facing you.Stand on your feet so you have more power to push on the clay. Place both heels of your hands on the corner side of the face of the cube and push down, then forward. Peel the front of the cube off of your work surface back toward you, and push that side down and forward.Keep peeling back the front portion of the clay and pushing it down and forward. Wedge your clay in this way approximately ten times.


It’s customary and recommended to repeat the cubing process and wedging process at least twice just to be sure that all the air bubbles have be removed from the clay.If some of the clay is sticking to your work surface as you push down on it, simply place the chunk of clay on top and drag it away. The stuck clay will adhere to the larger chunk., Hold your chunk of clay in both hands. Use your fingers to gently pinch and flatten the clay, rotating the clay in your hands as you pinch.Rotating the clay will make all sides of the clay relatively even. This will be your rough base.

, Place your piece of clay on your work surface. Use the heel of your hand to flatten your piece of clay even more. The base should be about ¼ inch in thickness, and at least 3 inches in diameter.For a rough measurement, ¼ inch is about as thick as your pinky. Once you have flattened out your piece of clay, consider using a small roller to smooth out the base’s surface.


You can also flatten out and stretch the clay by throwing it onto your work surface.Simply pick up your piece of clay, hold it in one hand, then turn your hand over and throw the clay onto your work surface.
The clay should resemble a pancake. Do this as many times as you need to get the clay to its appropriate thickness.

, At this point, the edges of your base will be uneven. Try to make your base as even as possible. This could mean making the base a perfect circle, or making the base into an even oval.With either shape you choose to start with, use a needle tool to slice off irregular edges of the base.
If you want to make your base into a perfect circle, consider placing a glass or cup onto your base and tracing around the edge. This is an easy way to make a perfect circular base., Once you have your base traced out, consider smoothing out its edges. If you have a soft sponge, dip it in your water and wring out excess water. Then, gently drag the sponge around the outer edges of the base to smooth out any nicks and burrs created while tracing the base shape.This same smoothing technique can be done using your finger dipped in water.
You don’t want to add too much water to the base with your finger, you just want to smooth out any rough edges.

, Rip off another piece of clay from your clay bag and use your hands and fingers to pinch and squeeze it into a cylindrical shape.This shape doesn’t have to be perfect; it just has to be in a rough cylinder so you can start rolling it out on your work surface. One fat cylinder will make many coils.


Once you have your rough cylinder, softly twist the ends of the cylinder in the opposite direction from one another, almost as if you’re wringing out a cloth.This doesn’t have to be extreme twisting, just enough to give your cylinder a bit of a twisted appearance in the clay. This twist will help the clay roll out evenly and keep its circular shape.

, Place the rough cylinder on your work surface and position both of your hands in the middle of the cylinder. Roll the cylinder forward and backward underneath your hands, making sure the cylinder makes a complete 360° rotation.As you roll the cylinder, spread your hands out to the ends of the cylinder. This will elongate the cylinder making it look more like a coil. When you get to the ends of the coil, bring your hands back to the center and continue rolling the coil and pulling your hands out to the edges.


Eventually, the coil will get long enough that you can rip it in half and continue rolling to make more coils.The bigger you’re planning on making your pot, the more coils you will need.
Your coils should be about as thick as your pinky finger, but there can be some slight variation. If you roll your coils too thin, they will start to dry and crack., If you notice a flat spot forming in the coil, stop rolling and twist the ends of the coil opposite from each other and continue rolling.Adding too much pressure to one section of the coil as you roll causes a flat spot.


If you see a thinner or thicker section of your coil, you are not adding equal pressure as your roll. Fix the thicker section of the coil by adding more pressure with your hands as you roll that area.
Fix the thinner section of the coil by bringing your hands together as you roll rather than spreading your hands out. This will bring some clay back toward the thinned out area., Use your needle tool, kitchen fork, or serrated edge of your rib tool to gently scrape at the top edges of the base where your first coil will be laid.Scratch at the base surface in both directions (crisscross appearance) to create a rough surface for the coil to grip and adhere to.

, You will also need to slightly score the bottom of the coil that will be laid on top of the base.Again, this creates a coarse surface so both the coil and base can adhere to each other.

, Once the base is scored you need to slip it. That means adding a little bit of water onto the scoring to act as glue.You can use your damp sponge or your finger dipped in water to add slip onto the scored edge of the base.

, Place the scored coil on top of the scored edge of the base. Once you have laid the coil all the way around the base, overlap the coil ends. Use your needle tool to slice through the overlapped ends of the coil diagonally.Remove the excess ends, and use your fingers to connect and blend the two remaining ends of the coil together.The two remaining ends of the coil should match up evenly because they were cut at a diagonal.

, Use your finger to push down and blend the interior edge of the coil to the base of your pot.As you push down on the clay from the inside of the coil, use your other hand to support the outside of the coil, as the pushing can slightly disturb the coil you have laid.Once you have blended the entire coil, consider, using your finger to smooth out all the little ridges made by the blending.

, After your first coil is laid, continue the process of scoring and slipping as you add more coils.Gently score the top of the first laid coil, and add a little bit of slip. Lay down your next coil, slicing the ends of the coil off diagonally, and connecting the remaining ends of the coil.


With each consecutive coil added, the interior edge of that coil must be blended into the coil below it., As you add coils, you can either widen or narrow the shape of the pot. If you want to widen the shape of the pot, lay down upcoming coil on the outer edge of the coil beneath it.Eventually, the pot will slowly widen. In the same way, if you want to narrow the shape of the pot, lay down the upcoming coil on the inner edge of the coil beneath it. Keep adding coils to your pot until it reaches your desired height.


If you are widening your pot, your coils will eventually need to be longer. If you are narrowing your pot, your coils will become shorter.To make the widening or narrowing of the pot more gradual, the coils must be laid down on the outer or inner edge of the previous coil in small increments. The bigger the increments between each laid coil, the more abrupt and drastic the angle of the widening or narrowing will be.

, Once you are finished building your pot, decorate the top coil or lip of the coil to complete your pot. You can stamp shapes into the coil, you can use your fingers to pinch a design into the coil, or you can leave it as is.Finishing the pot is really all about your personal and artistic preference.


When you are ready to dry your pot, read the instructions that came with the clay on how it must be dried.Some clay can harden and dry by being left out and air-dried, but most clay needs to be fired in a kiln.

",How to Cook in an Unglazed Clay Pot," The ratio is usually 6 cups of water to 4 tbsp. of flour. Use any flour such as rice, wheat, tapioca, all-purpose etc. Using a few drops of cooking oil and turmeric is optional.;
,, Rinse the pot thoroughly pat dry with a towel and start cooking!

,, Let it stay at this heat for 5-10 minutes.

, Unglazed pots hold all the heat given to them, so no heat is lost and there's no need to go past medium setting.


While most brands recommend the use of a heat diffuser, with others a diffuser is not required when cooking on gas cook tops.

,,,  You can go up to 450 to 500 degrees in the oven but you'll soon find out that the pot does not need as much heat to cook the same food.  


Most times food can cook at about 50 degrees or so less than the temperature setting called for on the recipe.

, After the seasoning process, use the pot a few times back-to back, i.e use it often at least 3 to 4 times. This helps the pot to shrink slightly and will prevent it from holding moisture.

, Once used a few times you may not have to dry it this way. It will dry on its own.

, They go well with the pots.

, Unglazed pure clay pots become completely non-stick in a few uses so cleaning them is very easy. Also, since most of the steam rising from the food is locked inside food seldom burns or sticks to the bottom.


Using baking soda is recommended for cleaning: wet the pot and lid thoroughly with water, sprinkle 1/2 tsp of baking soda, scrub and rinse off. Dry the pot with a cotton towel/rag and put it away to dry.

When you're finished, get a wire or fishing line, and use it to cut the bottom off the wheel.,
Dry it by air for about two nights then you are ready to foot.",How to Make a Clay Pot by Wheel," Find the kind that you can get messy. Make sure the clay you're using is washable, and that no valuable things are in the room.;
, Squish on it here, then over there, then there... I advise to not fold it over itself, as that would create what you're trying to get out, air bubbles. Squish your clay until it's workable. You can check your clay by cutting it in half with a wire. When you cut it and don't see any air bubbles it should be good to go. Kneading is best you can either throw your clay at a surface or ox head knead it.

, Smack, not pound.

,,,, Center the clay by placing one hand on the side and the other on top of the clay cone. The hand on the side should push towards the middle of the wheel and the hand on top should just keep the clay from pushing up into a mess. You will know it is centered when the clay looks like it is not moving but the wheel is moving. This step is extremely important. If your clay is not centered, it will be difficult/impossible to make a nice pot.

, You can do this a couple of times. It is called wheel wedging and it helps condition the clay. Make sure it is still centered when you are done.

, Also until it makes a round hole in the clay. OR you can use the carrot method by pressing your fingertip into the clay about an inch from the center slowly moving into the center, this method is harder than the first.

, This is unnecessary if you are making something thin. This is called a fishhook.

, Place one hand on the outside and the other on the inside of the clay wall make sure they are directly in line with each other so if you removed the clay from between them your finger tips would touch. Pull up the walls by starting at the base of the pot and pulling towards the top with even pressure on you finger tip. Continue this until you reach your desired height or until the walls are about a centimeter thick. Pull slower than the wheel is rotating to be even and push extremely lightly this may take a while so you have to be patient.

, This just take practice to learn. Experiment with different objects you can try patterns or pulling and pushing different ways as long as you WATCH the clay for signs of weak walls or collapsing.

, Not too much, or it'll fall off.

, You stop the wheel, wet the wheel not the pot, then slowly starting away from you take the wire/fishing line and pull towards you until the pot is off, be careful to keep the wire down!

, Once footed you use a kiln depending on the clay. Then you glaze it and fire it in the kiln once more. The first firing is optional.

Once your clay is kneaded, try one of the methods below to make your own pot.",How to Make a Clay Pot1," Start with about 1/2 pound (.25 kilos) of clay. Slowly warm it and work out the air bubbles by kneading it with your hands. This will even out the clay’s consistency, eliminating lumps of soft spots, and make it more pliable and easier to work with. Take care to avoid folding, poking, or other actions that could add air pockets and bubbles to your clay—these could cause your pottery to explode in the oven.

Set the dishwasher to quick-wash. Once you’ve soaked your pots, you’ll want to disinfect them.,
Run your pot through.,
Let them dry.",How to Clean Clay Pots," Before you can clean the pot, it obviously needs to be empty. Dump out old plants and dirt. If you want to keep the plants in the pots, remove them gently and set them in an empty pot until the original pot is clean and dry., Once the pots are empty, brush away as much of the dirt as possible with your hands. Most of it should come away easily, but some of it may not., For stubborn dirt, use a stiff bristled brush. Brush gently back and forth across the surface of the pot.Don't use metal bristles on your clay pots - they can scratch the pot and leave white marks in the clay.

, Mix together a 1:3 ratio of white vinegar to water in a large tub or sink. For example, you’ll want to use 1 cup (8 ounces) of vinegar with 3 cups (24 ounces) of water. If you’re cleaning a lot of pots, simply double or triple these amounts.You can also use a bleach and water mixture. Mix together ¼ cup (2 ounces) of bleach and five gallons of water., Place your pots in the water and vinegar solution and let them soak for twenty to thirty minutes. The liquid should completely cover your tallest pot.You might see or hear bubbles in the solution. That’s okay – it just means that the pots are coming clean.

, After 20 to 30 minutes, take the pots out of the liquid to check them. If they’re ready to come out, you should be able to easily remove any remaining residue with your hands or a brush.If you can’t easily remove the remaining residue, let the pots soak for 5 to 10 minutes longer.

, The rims of clay pots tend to become very dirty. If you have extra dirty rims, flip them upside down and place them on plates or in a bowl with a layer of pure vinegar in them. Let them sit for about 10 minutes., The amount of baking soda paste you need will vary depending on how many pots you’re cleaning and how extensive the salt stains are. But you should add just enough water to baking soda to give it the consistency of hand lotion., You should spread enough paste to cover the salt stains completely. It should be just thick enough to cover the stain., The paste will dry slightly as it sits – that’s okay., After five to ten minutes, use your hands or a brush to scrub away the now-dry paste. You might need to rinse the pots to completely remove the paste, but once you do, the salt stain should be gone., Set your dishwasher to its quickest wash setting, and add the amount of soap you would add for a small to medium load of dishes., Let your pots run through a full cycle in your dishwasher. The heat and the soap will disinfect your pots., Once your pots are done in the dishwasher, leave them in the rack to dry completely. This can take up to a couple of hours. You can also speed the drying process by placing them outside on a sunny day."

Once the clay is warm and pliable, take a fist-sized clump and roll it into a long rope called a coil.,
Create the bottom.,
Prep the clay and start working.,
Strengthen your pot.,
Shape your pot as you make it.,
Finish your pot.",How to Make a Clay Pot2," The diameter of the coil will determine the thickness of your pot's walls. For your first pots, roll your coils out till they’re a little thicker than a pencil, and about 12 to 24 inches (30 to 60 cm) long, and of uniform thickness.









You may get thin or weak spots as you roll your coil out. Try avoiding that section as you work, but if it becomes a problem just break the coil at the weak spot, set one part aside, and finish the other.

, Starting from one end, wrap the coil in a spiral until the bottom is the size you have in mind. For example, for a pot using coils about 1/4 inch (.6 cm), your base might be 3 inches (8 cm) in diameter.









You can also create the bottom by rolling out some clay to about the same thickness as your coils, and then trim the excess with a knife, using cup or plate as your guide.

, Score the outer 1/4 (.6 cm) inch of the bottom, and dampen with water or slurry (a thin mix of clay and water). Do the same with the bottom of the coils as you work. This will improve the clay bond and make your pot stronger. Lay the first coil on top of the base, and wrap it around, building up the wall.








, To make your work durable, strengthen the clay bond by smoothing down the inside of the pot, forcing down the clay from the upper coil into the joint below it.









To maintain the shape of your pot, support the outside of the pot as you smooth the inside.
You can smooth both inside and outside if you wish.

, Create your contours by adjusting the placement of the coils, and shaping the clay during the smoothing and strengthening process.








, Add any decoration or glazing as desired, and depending on what kind of clay you are using you may air-dry your pot, bake it, or fire it in a kiln. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the correct method.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions for finishing and firing your clay pot.








",How to Make a Clay Pot4," Throw it firmly from hand to hand, smacking it into a ball shape.








, This will help the ball of clay adhere to the wheel once it starts spinning. The last thing you want is a ball of wet clay flying across the room.








, Place a bucket of water where you can easily reach it to wet your hands while you work.








, Throw down the ball of clay as close to the center of the wheel as you can, then press it down into a conical shape.








, As you build up speed, wet the clay, and with one hand on the side of the clay lump, and the other side on top of it, ease the clump towards the middle. Use the upper hand to keep the clay from flying out of control.









You can tell the clay is centered when it no longer looks like it's wobbling, but sitting stationary in the center of the spinning wheel. Don't stop spinning.

, Then work the clay into a cone, then press it down into a thick disk. Repeat this step a couple times. This is known as ""wheel wedging"" and helps to condition the clay. Make sure you keep the clay centered as you work.








,, Continue working the hole, using a hand on the outside of the clay to shape your pot.








, Gradually pull the clay up with even pressure, until it's the desired height.








, If you want it a bit wider at the neck, just pull back with your inside fingers. Don't do it too hard.








, Wet the wheel (not the pot) and using a stiff wire or fishing line, and holding it with both hands, pull it from the back of the pot towards you until the pot is separate from the wheel.

",How to Make a Beaded Necklace," Make sure to have all of your materials at hand: beads, beading thread, wire cutter, crimp beads, super glue, and closures to properly finish your necklace.









The best kinds of wire are flexible beading wire and beading thread.
All of these materials are easily available at your local craft store (Michael's or Joanne's, for example).;
, When considering which style of necklace you'd like to create, think about factors such as length. If you like shorter necklaces you might consider making a collar or choker. If you like longer necklaces, you might want a lariat length (longer, usually down to your chest) necklace.

You can also make up your own style and length. These are simple suggestions to give you a rough idea.
Note that the finished length of your beaded necklace includes the beads you've used and the length of the jewelry clasp of your choice.
















, The collar is the shortest necklace and amounts to roughly 13 inches total length. The choker is a little longer, and goes down to about 14 to 16 inches. A Lariat is the longest, coming in at about and over 45 inches. As mentioned above, you can also choose your own length and style.

















, Take your tape measure, and loop it around your neck while looking at yourself in the mirror. Try small and big loops to see what you prefer. This will give you an idea of what your necklace might look like on your neck.









, Play with the beads until you find the design you like best. Try different color variations, perhaps even think of having multiple layers of string. You might want a choker that wraps around your neck a few times, or maybe just one long loop.

















, A bead board is a tool that greatly facilitates the process of stringing beads, and improves your design skills rapidly. You can use it to measure the length of your necklace, while keeping the beads in place. If you plan on making necklaces regularly, or even occasionally, you should have a board at hand.

Place your beads in your chosen design at the number zero, and measure the length of your necklace using the numbers and dashes along the sides.
Use the channels for laying out beads.
The tray insets are for holding beads and findings.
















, For example, if you'd like to make a choker, cut a total of 22 inches of thread (16 inches plus 6).

















, The next part will give you tips on how to thread beads properly.

















, Then, slide the crimping bead in, and then add another bead about 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so down. Keep in mind that you're not yet transferring your design onto the thread. These are necessary, preliminary steps that will secure your necklace.








, Then, make a loop with the stringing material.

















, Then add the bead-crimp-bead combo, and use the crimping tool/chain nose pliers to crimp the bead into place.

If using bead thread, you may wish to put a dot of super glue of hypo cement on either end to ensure that the beads and crimp stay on.)
These steps will protect the stringing material from rubbing on the ends of the crimp bead, which may cause the necklace to break.
















, Once you're satisfied with your design, carefully remove one bead at a time, and string it onto the thread. Be sure to leave about 3-4 inches (7.5-10 cm) of stringing material at the end.

Thread beads onto the stringing material until there are none left on your bead board.
















, Try to push the remaining stringing material into the bead holes below the crimping bead.

Be careful not to pull the stringing material too tight. Leave a small amount of slack in the necklace (2-4 mm or 1/4 inch). This leaves room for the beads to move and rotate, so they don't rub on each other or the stringing material too much. If the stringing material is too tight the necklace will be rigid and this can make the design look angular instead of slightly rounded like a necklace should be.
















, It is not recommended that you cut the wire too close to the crimp bead. 1 inch (2.5 cm) of wire, carefully hidden in the bead holes, is good insurance against breakage.

",How to Make a Spiral Wire Bead Ring," To make your spiral wire bead ring, you'll need sterling silver filled or non-tarnish silver wire (which won't turn your finger green). Purchase a 16 or 14 gauge roll of wire, and make sure it's half hard. For this ring, start with about 12 inches (30.5 cm) of wire. If you want to practice on cheaper wire, buy copper or nickel. You'll also need a bead with a hole in the center, wire cutters and needle-nose pliers.;
, Place center of wire against your form (a ring mandrel or dowel)and and wrap twice around, leaving the tails long.

,,,, Start by making a small circle with one of the wires where it emerges from the bead, then push the other wire behind and against it, being careful not to overlap the wires. If you see the spiral start to puff up, use a small block of wood and press gently but firmly on the spiral to push it against the bead as you turn the wires. Continue spiraling until the desired size is achieved. Be sure to leave a tail of at least 2"" (5 cm) on each wire to complete. Remove the ring from the mandrel or dowel.

, Wrap each end around the ring close to the bead, being careful not to overlap, until you're happy with the result. (You may need to use the needle nose pliers to do this part. Trim and tuck the wire ends down. If they still seem sharp or like they'll snag on things, use a metal file to smooth out the ends.

Create a 4” diameter structure to serve as the mask shape.,
Take some air dry clay.,
Add texture to the clay mask.,
Cut out the mask shape you want.,
Cut out eyeholes and a mouth.,
Use a straw or skewer to punch holes at either side of the mask if you want to hang it up.,
Decorate as desired.,
Leave the mask overnight to dry.,
Paint it with an acrylic paint, powdered metallic powders or mica paints to gain a fantastic finish!

",How to Make an Air Dry Clay Mask," To do this, you can curve a magazine and stuff some newspaper into the back of it. Once curved into a long semi-circle it can be taped to keep the shape. Alternatively, you can use a PVC pipe cut in half lengthwise. Each will allow a good mold for the mask. Once you have this shape (to avoid the clay sticking to it) insert it into a plastic bag. Put this to the side as you will need it later.;
, Put the clay on a piece of canvas and then roll it out to ¼” thick. This is best achieved by using a rolling kit which has slats to show the thickness.  or you can use and a rolling pin and wooden paint sticks. The amount of clay needed will depend on the size and decorative features of the mask you intend to make.

, You can use a lace doily or similar and continue to roll the clay with the rolling pin while still using the slats. This will leave a good imprint onto the clay.

, Use a skewer to cut around the clay to get the shape and then place the mask on the structural form you made earlier.

, To add volume to the features use small pieces of clay and roll and shape them into parts to form a nose, eyebrows, eyes or a lips.


Once shaped the pieces can be attached to the mask by dampening, with a little water, and brushing this onto both sides of the clay. Press the new features into the clay to make sure they are stick together well.
Alternatively use small pieces of clay to form shapes like a snake or use a cookie cutter to cut out any shape you like or perhaps even simply scratch some lines into the mask clay. Additional pieces can be attached as before with brushing a little water onto the clay.

, Once the clay is dry you can then add string or wire to the mask.

, If you wish to press any decorations, such as beads or jewels,  into the clay now is the time to do this.

, Place a plastic bag placed loosely over top of it.

Gather the materials listed here:


Scissors






A flexible ruler or a tape measure






String






Small beads





;
,
Using the ruler, measure around your finger.,
Thread the beads onto the string.,
When you're done threading, tie the string at the position indicated by the measurement you took earlier.,
Finish up and the ring is ready to wear.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Simple Beaded Ring,", Then add about two inches (5cm) to that, to allow space for tying. Mark the measurement you've made and cut a piece of string (it can also be wire, stretchy sting, yarn, or just regular thin string) the length of the measurement.

, Although you can thread beads randomly, it is more effective if you plan the bead layout before threading. This can be done by drawing a design on paper or by laying out the actual beads to be used on a jewelry board or on white paper or a clean surface. Using the beads is a good approach because it lets you visualize the end result easily and you can make instant changes to perfect the layout as you go. There are endless design possibilities, so don't be afraid to try out many ways. If you have a few designs you like, you can always make more rings and give them away to friends.


Be careful not to drop the string while you're adding beads, or else all the beads will fall off. It's a good idea to work over a tray in case this happens, so that the beads are easy to retrieve.You may want to tape one end of the string down on a flat surface to easily thread the beads.
Don't put beads along the entirety string or you'll have to remove them to be able to tie the ring together.

, Make sure that the ring fits before double knotting it.


Be sure to double or even triple knot your ties. If you don't, the ring risks falling apart.

, This method can also be applied to other jewelry such as necklaces and bracelets. Just adjust the measurements as needed.

Decide what shade of blue topaz you like best.,
Examine the stone's clarity and any visible flaws.,
Take time to comparison shop.",How to Choose Blue Topaz,"


Topaz comes in many varied colors with natural blue topaz being so light, it appears almost clear. Treated stones can come in a variety of blues and levels of saturation. Unless a stone is colorless, the assumption should be that it was heat-treated.
Heat treating involves heating the stones at varying temperatures and lengths of time to achieve blues that range from greenish to the more valuable London blue, which has a gray tint. The stones can also be almost aqua, sky blue or electric blue.;
,


Because rough topaz stones are available in such large pre-cut sizes, the stones cut by professionals should be practically flawless. If they are not flawless, they should be extremely inexpensive. Total clarity is the industry standard for the blue topaz. Light should travel unhindered through the stone, which should have a smooth and highly-reflective surface.
The value of the blue topaz often depends more on the cut than on the stone itself, so look for unique, striking cuts. A well-cut stone will shimmer when held to the light.

,


Blue topaz is a moderately-priced gem, so shop around to find the best deal. Prices for darker blue stones have gone up recently, mostly due to the lagging economy. To get the deeper colors the stones have to be treated for a longer period of time, which means they are held longer before they are sold.

Flatten the crimp bead.,
Cut the excess wire off the end of the crimping bead.,
Thread the beads.,
Add the second crimp bead and the clasp.,
Run the wire through the crimp bead again.,
Flatten the crimp bead.",How to Bead a Necklace," You can make anything from a choker necklace to another type of necklace that lies further from the neckline. The length of the wire you cut will depend on what type of necklace you want and on the neck circumference of the person it's for.Typically, non-choker necklaces are 17 to 35 inches in length. Around 35 inches of wire will make a very low hanging necklace, and 17 to 19 inches of wire will make a small, Princess style necklace.
Chokers are typically 12 to 16 inches in length, but it depends on the neck measurement.;
, If you're making a choker necklace, use a measuring tape to measure your neck around where you want the choker to be. Take note of this measurement and allow for an extra 3 extra inches on each side when cutting the wire.If this necklace is a choker for someone else, you'll need to measure their neck instead.

, Use the tape measure to measure out a length of the jewelry wire. Depending on what kind of necklace you want, this will be anywhere from the neck circumference you measured plus 6 inches to 41 inches. Cut the wire with the side cutters.


Always use side cutters, not scissors, when cutting wire.

, Depending on the size of your knot, you may have to tie a knot twice to make it big enough so the crimping bead will not slide through it.


You don't need any kind of special knot for this. Just a simple overhand knot will do.

, Grab a crimp bead and slide it down the length of the jewelry wire until you reach the knot, which is about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the end. Take a jump ring and slide it down the entire length of the necklace until you reach the crimp bead., Take the end of the wire and pass over the top of the jump ring, and thread the wire through the crimp bead. Pull it taut so that the crimp bead and the jump ring are close together., Hold the crimp bead and the jump ring in place with one hand. Use the crimping pliers to flatten the crimping bead. The crimping bead works as a jewelry stopper, so the jump ring will not slide off the jewelry., This gives your necklace a professional and streamlined look.

, Thread the beads along the string until you reach the end of the necklace. Continue beading the beads along the necklace until all the beads are strung on the wire. Stop beading the necklace once you're down to around 3 inches of wire left on the unfinished end., First, tie another knot near where the beads end on the unfinished side of the necklace. String the crimp bead and the clasp. As with the other side, you may need to tie two knots to keep the crimp bead from sliding past it.

, Take the wire over the top of the clasp and thread the wire through the crimp bead. Pull it tight so that the crimp and the clasp are close together., Hold the clasp against the crimp bead with one hand. Take the crimping pliers and flatten the crimp bead. Cut the excess wire with the scissors."

Beads come in a multitude of colors, shapes and sizes, and of course at a wide variety of price points.;
, While it may be fun to simply go to a bead store & buy everything that catches your eye, that's an easy way to completely blow your bead budget. Instead, look at the project or projects you'd like to complete and assess exactly what you need for each project, so you're not buying unnecessary beads or supplies.


If you want to use a pricier or fancier bead, make it the focus of your project, and use less expensive beads or other materials around your focal bead.

, Don't think of your local bead or craft store as the only place to get beads!:


Salvage beads from previous crafts or jewelry you may have made but don't want anymore.
Check out local thrift shops or garage sales for inexpensive beaded jewelry; simply take the jewelry apart and you have a ready source of beads to re-use.
Find natural materials such as stones, wood or seeds that fit the style of your project; drill a hole through and you've got yourself a lovely natural bead.

, You may not be able to afford to set up your own glass-blowing studio yet, but you can still make your own beads from paper, polymer clay, even recycled snack food bags!

, You may be able to set up bead swaps, where you can exchange beads you won't use for some new beads."

Test the length of the band of your ring.,
Finish your beaded ring by securing the open end.",How to Make a Beaded Ring1," You'll need to make sure that the wire you choose is thin enough for your seed beads, which can come in different sizes. If you are interested in using a thicker gauge wire, you should be sure the beads you purchase fit the thicker wire.Size 15/0 seed beads (1.3 mm) should usually be able to fit on 16 gauge wire and thinner. Larger seed beads, like size 6/0 (3.3 mm), will accommodate thicker wire, in this case eight gauge and thinner.
Due to differences in the finishing process of seed beads used by bead producers, seed bead diameters are only an approximation, and may require thicker or thinner wire.;
, You should be sure that your work area is clear before you attempt to cut and shape the band of your ring.You might also consider putting your beads into containers. This will make the beads more accessible and decrease your chances of a spill.

, Take your ruler and measure out about five inches (13 cm) of wire. Then bend it slightly where you have measured to mark where you will cut. You may need your pliers to bend the wire, but once you do:


Use your wire snips to cut loose the wire you will be using as the band of your ring.

, This is the main bead that will form the top of your ring. Using a large bead for your centerpiece can give your ring a cool distinguishing feature, but if you prefer, a regular sized bead will work just as well. Simply thread your centerpiece bead onto the end of your wire.


If a bead centerpiece isn't your style, you might think about using a charm attached to a jump ring.
Be sure your jump ring is small enough that it is held in place by the beads you will be threading on your band., Take your needle nose pliers and grasp the wire where you have just threaded your bead. Hold the wire firmly with your pliers, and then bend it over the bead to create a small, squashed loop.This bend in the wire will prevent beads slipping off as you work.

, Then you'll be able to thread it all the way down your wire until it joins your centerpiece bead.Keep in mind that your first bead will form the top of your ring, and the beads following it will wrap around the band.


Alternating short patterns by using two or three beads of different color can create nifty designs in your ring.
Keep your patterns short; the band of your ring will likely not be long enough to work with longer patterns.

, Don't worry about using too many beads; you can always take some off.

, Coil your wire so that it loops in on itself, with the unbent end circling around to meet the other end. Hold the free end with your hand, and then tighten the loop around the finger of your free hand to see if your beads wrap the full way around to form a snug fitting band.


If the band of your ring is too tight, you should add a few more beads.
If the band is too loose, simply remove a few beads and then try it on your finger again.

, Thread the free end of your wire through the loop you made to hold your centerpiece in place. Then, wrap the excess wire two or three times around the band to secure it in place.Finish your beaded ring by using your wire snips to cut free any left over wire.Bend any sharp edges either inward toward a bead or outward and away from where your finger will go to prevent being poked by your snipped wire.

",How to Make a Beaded Ring2," This design of beaded ring is ideal for displaying a lovely centerpiece, like a lampwork bead, tablet or tube bead, or other kinds of glass bead. Choose your elastic so that it fits your centerpiece, and along with the centerpiece and elastic, also be sure you have:


Bead stringing elastic (6-8 in (15 - 20 cm))
Centerpiece bead
Scissors
Sterling silver ""daisy"" spacers (about 40)
Sterling silver bead caps (2)
Sterling silver round beads (3; size 4 mm)
Wire needle, Having your beads separated into containers can decrease the time you spend hunting for your next bead and prevent irritating spills. Take a moment and, depending on your supplies, use a small container to hold and divide your beads by type.


If you bought in bulk, a tupperware container is a great option for bead storage.
Ramekins and smaller sized, wide mouthed cups work well for smaller amounts of beads.

, Using a wire needle will make it easier for you to thread your beads onto your elastic, and will also give you something to hold on to, making dropped thread and beads less likely. To thread your needle:


Hold your thread firmly between your forefinger and thumb as close to its end as possible.
Take your needle with your free hand and push its eye onto the thread until it is threaded., Bead caps on either side of your centerpiece will create a lovely, professional looking setting. Your first ""bead,"" after your centerpiece, should be your cap followed immediately by a silver bead. Then add daisy spacers until you have reached about half way around the band of your ring.


You can check to see if you've reached the halfway point by holding your centerpiece on the top of your finger and drawing the band around your finger.
If the band reaches halfway around your finger, you're ready to move on.
Be sure you have a firm hold of the end of your string when measuring. Beads can easily fall off.

, Mark the halfway point with a silver bead and then continue threading your daisy spacers onto your line. The number of daisy spacers you use should be the same to create a symmetrical, polished appearance.As you add more spacers, periodically check the length of the band. Hold the centerpiece to the top of your finger and use your free hand to wrap it around.
Be careful to keep the end of your line firmly gripped to prevent beads from falling off.
Your ring should feel snug on your finger when you have threaded your last spacer.

, Now that the spacers are finished, your ring is almost complete. All you need to do is thread your needle through the final silver round bead to reflect the bead on the outside of your first bead cap. Then:


Follow your bead with the ending bead cap to complete the a setting around your centerpiece.
Thread your needle through your centerpiece bead.

, Hold your band firmly so there is no wasted excess in the band. Extra band will translate to a loose ring in the end. Secure both ends with a surgeons knot and then hide it by:


Crossing your needle over the opposite end to form a loop.
Taking your needle through the loop twice.
Pulling the knot tight to make it as small as possible.
Wiggling the band until the knot is covered by your centerpiece.,"

, Roll some black clay into a small ball, about the same size as your thumbnail, or half the height of the body.

, Gently press the head on top of the penguin's body. Don't worry if the head squishes a little. If you'd like, you can use a clay sculpting tool to smooth the seam between the head and the body.

, Clean your hands first, then knead some white clay until it turns soft. Roll the clay into a thin sheet using an acrylic rolling pin or tube. You can find acrylic rolling pins in the polymer clay aisle of an arts and crafts store.


If you can't find any acrylic rolling pins, you can use a regular rolling pin, a fat marker, or any other smooth cylinder.

, The oval will make the belly and the heart will make the face. Both need to be a little smaller than the body and head respectively. You can use mini polymer clay cutters for this; they look like miniature cookie cutters. You can also cut the shapes freehand with a craft blade instead., Gently press the white heart onto the head, and the white oval onto the body. Make sure that the bottom of the heart and the top of the oval go into the crease between the head and body.

, Clean your hands again, and knead some more black clay until it turns soft. Roll the clay into a thick, black sheet. Plan on making it twice as thick as the white sheet. This will eventually make the wings.

, Start by cutting an oval out of the clay, a little bit shorter than the body. Cut the oval in half, lengthwise, so that you end up with two semi-ovals. You can use a craft blade to do this., Gently press the wings down onto the body to either side of the white belly. The flat edges of the wings should be facing the white belly. The tips of the wings should be nestled into the crease between the head and the body.


Don't worry if the wings overlap the white belly a little.
Consider flipping the bottom of the wings outwards for a cute touch., Clean your hands, and knead some orange clay. Roll the clay into a tiny teardrop or cone.

, Press the bottom of the teardrop/cone into the middle of the penguin's face.Use a craft blade to cut the beak open after you attach it, if desired. This will give your penguin an open mouth instead of a closed one.

, Roll a small ball out of orange clay. Cut the ball in half using a craft blade. Cut two notches into each dome to make the feet., Turn the penguin upside down. Pinch the back of both feet, then press them into the base of the body. Make sure that the front of the feet (the notched parts) stick out from under the body. Place the penguin right-side-up against the table, and adjust the feet, if needed., If you wish to turn this penguin into a charm, press a jewelry eyehook through the top of the head and into the body. If the hook is very long, trim it down first using a pair of wire cutters., Turn on your oven, and let it reach the recommended temperature, usually between 215 to 325°F (102 to 163°C). Place the penguin on a foil-lined baking sheet, and bake it for the recommended time, typically 15 to 20 minutes.


Each company will be a little different, so you will need to read the label on the clay's wrapper.
If your penguin has a lot of fingerprints on it, gently brush it with a soft-bristled paintbrush before you bake it.

, Use a black permanent marker to draw two dots on the penguin's face, right above the beak. Position them in the loops of the ""heart"".You can also use a thin brush and acrylic paint.

, If you wish to make the penguin shiny, get some glaze meant for polymer clay. Paint the penguin with the glaze, then let the glaze dry.Refer to the label on the bottle, as each brand's drying times will vary.

Cut off one of the pointy ends of the oval, so that the penguin can stand upright.Penguins are typically black, but since you are making a cute penguin, you can make him or her any color you want! Pink, baby blue, or light purple would be especially cute!

, Clean your hands first to avoid transferring color, then knead some white clay until it softens. Roll it into a thin sheet using an acrylic rolling pin. You can find it in the polymer clay aisle of an arts and crafts store.If you can't find an acrylic rolling pin, you can use another smooth cylinder, such as a fat marker or a rolling pin.

, This will make the body and face of your penguin. It needs to be the width as body, but a little shorter. Use a craft blade to cut the shape out.

, Be sure to match up the base of the ""m"" with the base of the body. You will have a slight gap between the top of the ""m"" and the top of the body., Clean your hands, then knead some orange clay until it turns soft. Press it into a thin disk, then cut a small triangle out of it using a craft blade.

, Press the triangle into the middle of the white part on the body. Make sure that the pointed tip of the triangle is pointing downward., Roll two small balls out of black clay. Press each ball onto the penguin to either side of the beak. They should just barely be touching the upper corners of the bead.If you don't have any black clay, you can skip this step, and paint the eyes on instead after you are done baking.

, Measure the eyehook against the penguin first. If it is too long, trim it down with a pair of wire cutters. Push the eyehook down through the top of the penguin., Preheat your oven to the temperature specified by the manufacturer, typically between 215 to 325°F (102 to 163°C). Place your penguin onto a foil-liked baking sheet. Bake the penguin for the time recommended by the manufacturer, typically 15 to 20 minutes.


Each brand of clay will have different baking times and temperatures. Read the label on the clay's wrapper carefully.
If the eyehook is still look, put a little superglue around the seam.

, After the penguin is done baking, take it out of the oven and let it cool. Use a thin paintbrush and some orange, acrylic paint to add two small v's at the bottom of the penguin. If you don't have any paint at home, you can use an orange permanent marker instead.

, Get some glaze meant for polymer clay. Thread some string through the eyehook and tie it into a loop. Dip the penguin into the glaze, then lift it out. Let the excess glaze drip off, then hang the penguin by the loop so that it can dry.Place a sheet of scrap paper under the penguin as it is drying to catch any excess glaze.

Use the angel as a charm or ornament.",How to Make a Polymer Clay Angel," Start with something that is about the size of your thumbnail; this will make the ideal size for a charm or ornament. You will be positioning the oval sideways, with the narrow ends on the sides.Your angel's skin tone can be as fair or as dark as you'd like.;
, This step is optional, but it can give your angel a more professional touch. Add a tiny ball of clay to the center of the face. Blend in the edges using a clay tool. Use a toothpick to carve in a simple mouth., This will be the angel's gown, so you can use any color you want. White and pastel colors work especially well. Flare out the bottom of the cone into a trumpet-like shape.

For a fancier touch, add ripples to it the flared part with a clay tool or the end of a paintbrush.

, Start by cutting off the pointed tip of the cone with a pair of scissors or a craft blade. Smooth the cut edge so that it is more rounded.

For a more detailed gown: roll some clay into a ball, then flatten it into a disk. Press it onto the cone. It should be the same width as the top of the cone., Pull off two more small chunks of the same clay you used for your angel's gown. Roll them into cones, about half the height of the body cone. Make them fairly thin and a little bit shorter than the cone.

Use the end of a paintbrush or a clay tool to make dents in the bottom of the cone. This will make attaching the hands easier.
If you don't want your angel's gown to have sleeves, roll out two thin coils if skin-toned clay instead. Round the ends to make hands.

, Attach the tips of the arm cones to the top of the body cone. You can position the arms flat against the body, or bend them into a different position. If you wish to bend the arms into a different position, do it before you attach them.

Don't worry if they look too short now. You will add hands next, which will lengthen them.

, Pick off two small chunks of the clay you used for the head. Roll them into to small balls, a little bit narrower than the base of the arm cones. Gently press them against the bottom of the arm cones, right in the dent your made.

For extra hold, add a drop of liquid clay.
If you rolled out two thin coils of skin-toned clay for bare arms, skip this step.

, Pour a little bit of liquid polymer clay onto the top of the cone. Gently press the head into it. Make sure that the oval is oriented sideways, with the narrow ends facing left-and-right., Place the angel onto a foil-lined baking sheet, then place it into a pre-heated oven. Follow the baking temperatures on the package of clay you are using, but only bake it for half the recommended time. This will set the clay, and make it easier to add other details without smooshing the existing shapes. You will finish baking the angel after you add the other parts.Baking temperatures vary from brand to brand. Typically, they range between 215 and 325°F (102 and 163°C).You can bake the angel in a regular oven, a convection oven, or a toaster oven. Do not use a microwave, however., You can use an acrylic tube or a rolling pin to roll out the clay. This will eventually make the wings of your angel. If you'd like a fancier angel, use pearly-white clay instead., Start by cutting the sheet into a triangle, able the same size as the body cone. Cut the triangle in half. The short edges will make the inner part of the wings. The straight edges will make the bottom. The angled edges will make the top., The easiest way to do this would be to add vertical dents into the wings using a toothpick. Align the toothpick against the bottom of the wing, and angle the tip towards the top. This will create slight ripples in the wing. Space the dents 1 to 2 toothpick-thicknesses apart.For fancier wings: use a dotting tool or a ball-tipped embossing tool to draw short streaks into the wings.Consider adding a hint of shimmer by dusting on powdered eyeshadow with a soft, fluffy brush., Use a toothpick to add a glob of liquid clay onto the back of your angel. Press the wings into the liquid clay. Angle the wings so that they look like an M. Smooth out the seam between the two wings., Start by rolling two small balls of clay about the size of a pin head. Press each ball onto the sides of the angel's head, turning them into slight disks. Make them level with the dent, and position them closer to the face than to the back of the head., Use a clay tool, or another blunt-tipped tool, to blend in the front part of the ears towards the angel's face. Do not blend in the back of the ears., Choose some clay for your angel's hair. It can be yellow, brown, black, or even a surprising color, like pink or purple. Roll out your desired clay into a thin sheet. You can use an acrylic tube to do this, or simply press the clay between your fingers to make a ""pancake."" Use a toothpick to draw streaks into the clay going widthwise., Be sure to cover the top of the head as well. Don't cover the face.Smooth the top of the sheet over the top of the head. If you'd like to, you can add a parting crease with a toothpick., Roll out thin coils of clay, then attach them to the front of the hairline. They can be as long and wispy as you'd like. For a more realistic effect, have all the smaller hair pieces come from the start of the part.

Consider adding some streaks to the bangs before you attach them to the head.To make curls: attach tip of coil to head, twist the other end into a coil, then position it using clay tools or a toothpick.To make blunt-cut or straight-across bangs: roll out a thin sheet of clay, then cut it down to a triangle or rectangle shape that will fill in the gap on the forehead. Press it onto the forehead.

, Roll some yellow, pale yellow, or gold clay into a thin coil. Wrap the coil into a ring. For a fancier touch, use a soft, fluffy brush to dust gold eyeshadow onto the clay., Simply place the halo on top of the angel's head. For a stronger hold, coat the inside rim of the halo with liquid clay first., Measure the eye pin against the angel first. The eye part of the pin should rest right against the top of the angel's head. If the pin is too long, cut it down with a pair of wire cutters. Once the pin is the right length, push it right through the top of the angel., Follow the baking instructions on your package of clay, but only bake it for half the recommended time. This will bake the head, body, and arms the rest of the way. The hair, wings, and halo will also get baked all the way as they are thinner., Use a permanent pen to add to small dots for the eyes. Add two thin curves above each eye for the eyebrows.Draw a small curved line or a dot for the mouth. If you carved a mouth, you don't have to draw it.

Alternatively, you can paint on the face instead using acrylic paint and a thin paintbrush.
Add some blush with a q-tip, if desired. You can use colored powder, actual blush, or pink water color. Keep the blush light and pale., Choose a glaze meant for polymer clay, then apply it using a paintbrush. You can also add some iridescent glitter glue along the wings and base to make it more sparkly., If you want to use the angel as a charm: twist open a jump ring with a pair of needle nose pliers. Slip the jump ring through the eye pin, then twist it close. If you want to use the angel as an ornament: thread some string through the eye pin. Tie the ends of the string together into a loop.

You can also use the angel as a figurine. Stand it on your desk, shelf, or wherever you'd like.

This clay doesn't dry in the air, so it's perfect for making clay models out of. If you want your clay person to be still once it's done, you can use oven-bake clay.


You can make your clay person all the same color, or you can use different colors for different parts of the body. For example, if you want it to look like your clay person is wearing a shirt, you can use a green or white piece of clay for the torso.;
, Pinch off a piece of the clay. Roll the piece of clay into a ball. This will be the clay person's head.


It's up to you what color the clay person's skin will be. You can make the whole person out of blue clay, or you can find some flesh colored clay for the head and arms., Pinch off a piece of clay that's larger than the head. Shape this piece into a fat snake-like cylinder. Flatten the cylinder slightly.

, Pinch off two more pieces of clay. Roll these pieces into two long tube shapes. One tube should be thicker than the other. These will become the arms and legs., Take the ball that will be the head and pinch out of it a little spike of clay. This will be how the head will attach to the body.


The neck should jut out of the head like a small spike or cone, and should be about half the length of the neck. And make sure it's thick enough that you can hold the head up by holding nothing but the neck between two fingers.

, Take something narrow, like a pencil, or a toothpick, and burrow out a small hole in the top of the body cylinder. Make sure the hole isn't too wide, but wide enough for the neck to fit in. Make the hole deep enough for the neck to go completely in.

, Stick the neck into the hole in the body so that the ball touches the body. Smooth out the edge where the head meets the body to make it secure., Find the middle of the smaller tube and tear it into, for the two arms.

, With your thumb and finger, flatten a small bit of one end of both arms. These will become the hands.

, First, cut out a bit of the flattened parts. Use something sharp to cut out a corner of the flattened ends of the arms. Then round out the corners of the hand so that it looks like a cartoony thumb and fingers.

, Take the finished arms and attach them to the sides of the body. Smooth out the connection between the arms and body to secure them.


If the arms are too long, tear off an even amount from both arms until they're as short as you'd like., Find the middle of the larger tube and tear it into, for the two legs.

, Bend one end of both of the legs. Shape this bent part into a rough foot shape. Make sure they are large enough to support the legs. Stand the legs up to test the feet. Press the feet into the table so that the feet bottoms are flat.

, Stick the legs into the bottom of the body. Smooth the connection between the legs and body to secure them together. Make sure the feet are facing forward.If the clay person can't stay standing on its own at this point, you'll need to redo the legs and make them thicker.

, If you're clay person can't stand up on its own after you attach the legs, there could be a balancing issue. You can always make the legs thicker, but sometimes the legs are plenty thick, and it still falls over. In that case, you might want to redo various parts of the person and experiment with a shorter torso, less clay for the torso, smaller arms, a smaller head, ect.


Also make sure the clay person's torso is straight, and that the arms are close to the same size and weight.

, Tear off four small bits of clay. Make four balls out of these clay pieces. Two of these balls should be smaller than the others.

, Push the smaller balls into the larger ones. Flatten them a bit into the bigger balls. These will be the eyes.

, Press both eyes firmly into to the head of your person.If you want, you can use another method to make eyes, such as using two googly eyes, or making eyes out of paper.If you want a simpler method for making eyes, you can just take a pencil and make two round holes in the head for eyes. You can use a pencil to carve out a smile or open mouth as well.

, Take a small pinch of clay and roll it into a small tube. The tube should be no longer than the width of the head. You can make it as thin as you'd like the mouth to be.

, Place the small tube under the eyes, where the mouth should go. With the flexibility of the tube, you can make any sort of expression you want, a smile, a frown, or any other mouth shape.

, You can add a nose to your clay person's face by just taking a small bit of clay and sticking it in the center of the face. Then use your fingers to form it into any sort of nose shape you want, a small ball, a little triangle, whatever shape you prefer.

Be creative, although a piggy bank is certainly fine to make. Think about your interests or pets, such as cats or football. Anything that is fairly round or has a body can work. If you are stuck without ideas, here are some to name a few:


Any animal: usually very simple structures, and cute, too! If you like animals, this is the way to go. Some more specific ideas for an animal are dogs, cats, turtles, elephants, horses, and rabbits.

Sports: Make a ball if you're a sports lover! You can make a football, soccer ball, basketball, or bowling ball (with three round holes instead of one little slit).

Food: A very creative idea, but can be tricky! If you want to make a food, try a hamburger, cupcake, apple, or even a stack of pancakes!;
, Make sure that it is very round, or else it won't be a piggy bank! If, however, you are making a bank where the body isn't completely round, such as a football, shape the clay more into that shape. But with animals, you can add details like the head and tail later, this is just the body or base of the bank where the money will be held., Make sure that the halves are even, so try as best as you can to cut through the center. They should also be clean (without any tears). Now you will have two half-circles., Take one clay piece and press your thumb through the center, but not all the way. Start to knead with your fingers outward, pushing the clay in the center to make a dent, like a bowl. Make sure that it is somewhat deep, but check the edges. They shouldn't be too thick, no thicker than 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm), but no thinner than 1/4 an inch at the bottom. Do this with both halves.

, Take the scoring tool and quickly flick it across the width of the edges of the bowl. Do this to both of the bowls. Make sure you go all the way around the bowls. You score clay so that the two bowls will soon connect and stick together., You may have to apply the water more than once. The, press the two halves together and apply more water on the crack where the bowls come together. You can also use your fingers the same way. After applying the water or smoothing the clay with your fingers, you shouldn't be able to see the crack. Now you have one piece of clay again., At the top of the piggy bank, stick the knife in until it goes all the way through. Work around that, cutting a rectangle shape. This is the coin slot. Don't make this slot too big, no wider than a centimeter.

Also make a slot for the bottom of the bank. Do the same thing you did for the top coin slot, but make this one a circle. Make sure that it is big enough for a quarter to come out, but don't make it too big or else all of the coins will quickly come through.

, This is the fun part! If you are making an animal, roll extra pieces of clay for the head and stick them on the body of the bank by scoring, adding water and smoothing it with your fingers. Add a tail for certain animals.


Legs: for legs, make oval shapes and gently flatten them on a surface. You can then add them to your animal. This works great with elephants and turtles! But, make sure that the legs are thick enough to support the rest of the body.







Face: to add a face, use the clay knife to poke eyes and a mouth for your animal.
You can use the clay knife for other details, too, like writing in letters, numbers, or anything that would add to your bank.

, Put the bank in an oven for a few minutes. The temperature should be 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit)., Be creative! Paint over your bank the way you like it. You can add polka dots to your pig, or purple frosting to your cupcake. But, it is good to paint over your bank at least twice so the colors stay on. Let the glaze dry for an hour or two.

Put the clay in the oven again (optional) on 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) for 10 minutes.
Enjoy your piggy bank!

Allow your horse to dry and paint if desired.",How to Make a Clay Horse," Many modeling clays are oil-based or wax-based, which means that they do not dry out. In fact, these clays can be exposed to air yet remain malleable for long periods of time, allowing you both to move and reshape your creations at will and to preserve your pieces for long periods of time.Modeling clay is also sturdier than a material like play-doh and typically holds its shape better, making it easier to craft more detailed pieces. Note, though, that oil and wax-based modeling clays cannot be hardened, and painting these kinds of clay is not recommended.If you would like to be able to paint on your clay horse, polymer clay might work better for you.;
, Find a hard, flat surface to work on. Oil-based modeling clays can be messy and can leave greasy stains on uncovered work surfaces, so depending on how clean you’d like to keep that surface, you may find it helpful to cover your workstation with newspaper, wax paper, or saran wrap.

, Based on what size of horse you’d like to make your horse, estimate how much clay you’ll need.


If you are new to clay modeling, you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the scale of your horse; instead, start with a piece of clay that you can hold comfortably in one hand.

, Once you’ve got the right amount of clay, begin either squeezing it between your hands or place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough. Continue squeezing or kneading until the clay is warm, soft, and easy to work with.

, Cut your clay into four pieces using a craft knife, wire clay cutter, or your hands. One piece should be slightly larger than the the other three (which should all be approximately the same size).

, Take your largest piece of clay and mold it into an oblong circle. Gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse’s neck.


Since you’ll want your horse’s body to be able to support its head, be sure not make the neck too long or too thin.

, Begin by mold one of your three equal-sized clay pieces into a peanut shape. Next, gently pinch one end of your peanut shape, elongating it (this will be your horse’s nose and mouth).

, Using another one of your three equal-sized sections, craft two triangle-shaped ears and two round eyes; be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail, though. Carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse’s head. Finally, attach your completed head to your horse’s neck.

, Cut your third play-doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size. Create long cylinder-shaped legs by rolling each of these pieces between your fingers until they're a length and width that look proportionate in relation to your horse's torso.


The thickness and height of your legs will depend on whether or not you'd like your horse to be able to stand upright. Thicker and shorter legs, for instance, will make for a sturdier base.

, Break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves. Roll each hoof into a ball. Pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger, making them into short cylinders. Attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg. Now attach two legs to front end of your horse’s torso and two to the back end.

, Break the last of your clay into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair. To complete your horse, attach your tail to the rear end of the horse’s torso and your mane to the back of the horse’s head and neck and between its ears.

, Pieces made from polymer clay can be put in the oven to harden (although you can also purchase air dry polymer clay), making it a good choice if preserving your sculpture is important to you.Polymer clay can also be painted, which is ideal if you are looking to create a more detailed clay model.
Keep in mind that young children should never attempt to bake their polymer creations on their own; adult supervision is always required when using an oven.

, Find a hard, flat surface to work on. Cover your work surface in newspaper if you are concerned with messiness.

, While the scale of your model is ultimately up to you, remember that larger pieces will take longer to cure in the oven. We suggest that you use an amount of clay that you can hold easily in the palm of one hand.

, To make your polymer clay as malleable as possible, begin by squeezing it between your hands. Work your until the clay is warm, soft, and easy to work with.


You may also choose to place the clay on your work surface and knead it like bread dough.

, You can use your hands, a craft knife, or a wire clay cutter to divide your clay. One of your four piece should be slightly larger than the rest, and the remaining three sections should be of roughly equal size.

, Mold your largest piece of clay into an oblong circle. Now gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to create a neck.


Make sure the neck isn’t too long or too thin -- if it is it won’t be able to support your horse’s head.

, Take one of your three equal-sized clay pieces and turn it into a peanut shape. Next, gently pinch one end of your peanut shape, elongating it, to make your horse’s nose and mouth.

, Using another one of your three equal-sized sections, create two triangle-shaped ears and two round eyes (but be sure to set aside some of this clay for your mane and tail). Carefully fasten the eyes and ears to the larger, more round end of your horse’s head. Now attach the head to your horse’s neck.

, Cut your third play-doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size. Roll each of these pieces between your fingers, creating long cylinders (legs), until they're a length and width that you desire.


The thickness and height of your legs should reflect whether or not you'd like your horse to be able to sturdily stand upright. Legs that are thicker and longer make for a sturdier base.

, Break off a small piece of clay from one end of each leg to create your hooves. Roll each small piece into a ball. Pinch these balls between your thumb and pointer finger until they resemble short cylinders. Attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg. Now attach two legs to front end of your horse’s torso and two to the back end.

, Break the last of your clay into smaller pieces, forming these pieces into strands or chunks of hair. Finish modeling your horse by attach your tail to the rear end of the horse’s torso and your mane to the back of the horse’s head and neck and between its ears. You can omit the clay mane if you would prefer to paint one on after you’ve cured your sculpture.

, Follow the packet instructions to ensure that you’re baking your piece at the right temperature and for the correct amount of time.


Temperatures used to cook polymer clay vary from 215°F (102°C) to 325°F (163°C). , Acrylic paint is generally recommended, but if you first coat your piece with a glaze made for polymer clay (e.g. Sculpey Glaze) you may use almost any kind of paint.Again, painting your horse is an entirely optional step.

, Many horses have spotted coats, which can be fun and a little more challenging to paint than single-colored coats. Remember, too, that while most horses found in nature are some shade of brown, beige, black, or grey, your artistic options are not as limited. If pink is your favorite color and you would like your horse’s coat or mane to be pink, by all means go for it.

, While many paints will dry in under half an hour, you may want to wait a little longer if you’d like to be on the safe side. Drying times may also vary depending on how thick a coat of paint you’ve applied.

, Coating your horse with a clear varnish will help ensure that the paint maintains a fresh look and doesn’t chip.Be sure your paint has dried fully before you cover it with varnish, and be sure that the brush you use for your varnish coat is clean.

, Play-doh can be a great sculpting material, particularly for younger artists, but is not your best bet if you’d like to create a more long-lasting sculpture.


Play-doh is good for young sculptors because it is very soft and easy for small hands to mold.
Play-doh is also food safe, making it a wise choice for curious toddlers who might try tasting their art supplies, and is marketed as being safe for ages two and up.Unfortunately, play-doh will dry out and crack if left sitting out, so be prepared for the fact that your piece may not remain intact or in good condition for long.

, While play-doh is fairly easy to clean up, covering your work station with newspaper can make the cleaning process easier., Decide how big you’d like your horse to be and estimate much play-doh you’ll need accordingly.


In the interest of keeping your project manageable, you may want to avoid getting too overambitious with the size of your model. Try starting with an amount of play-doh that you can hold easily in one hand.

, To ensure that your play-doh is as soft and easy to work with as possible, squeeze it between your hands until it is warm.


If you are using old play-doh that has begun to dry out, try working a small amount of water into it to restore its pliability., Using your hands, break your play-doh into four pieces, making one piece slightly larger than the rest (the other three pieces should be of roughly equal size).

, Take your largest piece of play-doh and mold it into an oblong circle. Gently pinch one end of your oblong circle and pull it upwards to form your horse’s neck.


Since you’ll want your horse’s body to be able to support its head, be sure not make the neck too long or too thin.

, Begin by mold one of your three equal-sized clay pieces into a peanut shape. Gently pinch one end of your peanut shape, elongating it, to create the horse’s nose and mouth.

, Using another one of your three equal-sized sections, craft two triangle-shaped ears and two round eyes (but make sure to set aside some of this play-doh section as you will need it later to make your mane and tail). Carefully attach your eyes and ears to the larger end of the horse’s head, and fasten your completed head to the horse’s neck.

, Divide your third play-doh section into four smaller pieces of equal size. Roll each of these pieces between your fingers, creating long cylinder-shaped legs.


How thick you and short (or how thin and tall) you make your legs will depend on whether or not you'd like your horse to be able to stand upright. Thicker and shorter legs will make for a sturdier base.

, Break off a small piece of clay from one end of each cylinder to use for your hooves. Roll each hoof into a ball, then pinch each ball between your thumb and pointer finger until they become short cylinders. Attach one of these short cylinders to the bottom of each leg, then proceed to attach two legs to front end of your horse’s torso and two to the back end.

, Break the last of your play-doh into smaller pieces and form these pieces into strands or chunks of hair. Attach your tail to the rear end of the horse’s torso and your mane to the back of the horse’s head and neck and between its ears.

, Play-doh is an air-drying clay, so let your piece sit out until it hardens (the drying process may take up to several days, so have patience).Once your horse has dried you can add color and detail to your sculpture using either acrylic or poster paint (this is optional). Bear in mind that even if you paint it, your play-doh horse is still likely to crack or crumble after some time, as play-doh is not intended to be long-lasting."

Decide how large the clay elephant will be.,
Decide on your clay colors.,
Start with the blue or gray clay.,
Make the eyes.,
Assemble the elephant pieces made thus far:


Begin by sticking the four legs onto the body piece.,
Make the trunk with blue or gray clay.,
Done.",How to Make a Clay Elephant," Is it going to be a good sized elephant, such as for display on your bookshelf? Or is it going to be a very small one, suitable for hanging off a bracelet as a charm?


The smaller the elephant is made, the fiddlier it will be to shape it, so keep this in mind when making your decision. If you don't like fiddly projects, make a larger elephant.;
, Do you want a normal shade for the elephant's body (gray) or would you perhaps like the infamous pink elephant? Other colors are fine too, such as red, blue or green. For the sake of an example, this elephant is going to be blue or gray on its body, with pink ears and a blue or gray trunk. The face pieces can be made from black or white clay, to provide adequate contrast.

, Mold the elephant's body, ears and legs:


Roll a round, elongated shape for the body. The example elephant would have a blue body.
Shape little legs. Make one stocky sausage shaped roll from the clay. Cut four exactly same sized pieces to form the four legs for the elephant.
Roll and flatten out two small pieces for the ears. Use a clay cutting tool to shape the ears in the traditional elephant ear's shape, cutting away excess clay.
Make a smaller version of the ears. This time make them out of pink clay. Stick the onto the ears.

, Roll small pieces of an alternative color clay (black or white) into tiny balls for the eyes.


You could also make a mouth, that's up to you.
Tusks are another possibility, from white clay. They're not essential, as your figurine is representative, but if you'd like to add them, then feel free to do so.

, Each time that you add a piece of clay, use the clay tool to help smooth the pieces into each other, so that the end result looks seamless. Test that the elephant is standing firmly. When you're happy that it's balanced, add the next items.
Attach the ears, once again smoothing the clay pieces together neatly. Shape the ears so that they are standing outward and look realistic.
Add the eyes. Simply stick these on; don't press too hard or their definition will be squashed.

, Make a thin sausage roll shape from the blue or gray clay. Roll it to the length that will fit with the elephant as now assembled.


Gently attach this to the elephant's face, under the eyes. Smooth the clay into place.
When you're happy that it's properly attached, use the clay tool to add small cuts down the length of the trunk, to make it appear wrinkled, as elephant trunks appear in real life.

, Follow the packaging instructions for the type of clay you've used. Some air dry, some require baking. When you've finished, your clay elephant is ready to be used as a display item (if made large) or as a jewelry charm (if made small).


If using for jewelry, be sure to attach a finding piece or loop before the charm is dried or baked, so that it stays in place firmly.

Pinch off two balls of modeling clay.,
Roll each ball into a long rope.,
Fold each rope into a brain hemisphere.,
Press the two lobes together.",How to Make a Brain Out of Clay1," For a brain with a diameter of 4 inches (10cm), each ball of clay you pinch off should be about 2 inches (5cm) in diameter. This brain will only be one color. Choose a pale pink or gray clay for best results.


Each ball of clay you pinch off during this step will need to be about half the desired size of your final brain. When in doubt, pinch off a little more rather than pinching off a little less. It will be easier to remove clay later than it will be to add clay.;
, Place one ball of clay between your palms. Rub your hands back and forth over the clay. This process should cause the clay to gradually roll out into the form of a rope. Once the rope begins to exceed the width of your palm, place the clay on a table or other flat surface. Place both palms on the clay and continue rolling the clay to expand the length. Keep going until you have a rope that is about 4 inches (10 cm) long and 1/8 inch (31mm) wide. Repeat with the other ball.


Do your best to use equal pressure on every portion of your clay rope to maintain uniform width for the length of rope.
If one area is thicker than the other, apply more pressure in this area to thin it out.
You can alter the thickness and length depending on how large or small you want the brain to be. The length of each rope will need to be about the same measurement as your desired final diameter. Add or subtract 1/16 inch (16mm) in width for every 2 inches (5cm) you add or subtract in length.

, There is no precise pattern you need to follow for this. Twist, turn and fold the rope over itself to create a random pattern of the surface of the brain. This ball will be one lobe of the brain, and when done, it should be a little longer than it is wide. Repeat with the other rope.Each hemisphere should have slightly flat side side along the length of the lobe where the two will fit together. This will flatten more when you press the two lobes to connect them.
The bottom of the lobe should also be slightly flatter than the top and exterior sides of each lobe.
Try not to smooth out the creases created on the surface as you make this ball. This rope-like pattern is what will give the clay a ""brainy"" look.

, Hold one lobe in each hand and gently press them together to attach the lobes into one brain figure. Use enough pressure to make the two portions of clay hold together.


Do not press too hard since doing so can flatten the brain out or smooth out the ropes.
The final brain should be slightly longer than it is wide..

Attach the cerebellum.,
Create the temporal lobe.,
Move on to the occipital lobe.,
Add the parietal lobe.,
Make the frontal lobe to complete the atlas.",How to Make a Brain Out of Clay2," It will be much easier to build a brain atlas if you first reference a picture of one. Doing so will make it easier to gauge where each piece fits in and how that piece should be shaped., Each color will be used to create a different section of the brain. Using different colors will make it easier for you to separate and identify each part of the brain.

Use a different color of clay for each section of the brain.
No particular color is assigned to a specific section of the brain in the atlas. Uses whichever color meets your preference.

, Pinch of a small amount of clay and roll it between your palms to create a thick rope. This section will have a slight “s” shape or elbow. Smooth the rope with your fingers until the top of it curves upward and to the left, while the bottom should be slightly longer than the top section and sink off to the right. The bottom should also have a pointed tip, while the top should have a flat edge and look a bit wider overall.

, Pinch off roughly half the amount you used with creating the brain stem. Roll and form this into a triangle with rounded edges. Position it so that one side of the triangle sits in the upper curve of the brain stem., Pinch off a roughly the same size lump of clay you used for the brain stem. Roll this clay into an oval shape. Place the center of this oval onto the top of the brain stem, and press it gently to attach the two pieces of clay together. The bottom, left half of the oval should reach half way up the left side of the cerebellum if we consider the bottom of the triangle to be the part matched to the brain stem., Take a piece of clay roughly the same size as your temporal lobe. Roll and flatten this piece into a quadrilateral which splays out at the top making a muffin shape. Position it so that the bottom center of the lobe connects to the top, left 1/4 of the temporal lobe. The right side right side of the occipital lobe should cover the other left half of the cerebellum, with the muffin top spilling slightly over the top of the cerebellum., Pinch off slightly more clay than the amount used to create your occipital lobe. Form another rectangle just larger than a square. One bottom shorter edge of the rectangle should cover the rest of the right half of the oval made by the temporal lobe. The rectangle should lean slightly to the right., This should be your largest bit of clay, and slightly larger than your original amount used to create the brain stem. Roll it into an oval, then slightly flatten the bottom right and left sides to attach them to the rest of your brain atlas. Wedge this final piece in place on the left of your model to create the front of the brain. The flattened bottom right section will attach to the parietal lobe, while the bottom left covers the top left half of the temporal lobe oval, slightly overlapping the edge."

Fit the thalamus inside the curve of the hippocampus.,
Connect the corpus callosum.,
Make the cerebrum.,
Attach the amygdala to complete the model.",How to Make a Brain Out of Clay3," Form two short ovals with your clay. One should be half the length of the other. Attach the shorter of the two to the left side of the longer, and smooth them out until they form one piece.This smaller bulge is the ""pons"" of the brain stem.
If you want to make this model part atlas, as well, you should use seven different colors, one for each part of the detailed brain model.

, The cerebellum looks like a small circle with two thin ropes connecting it to the brain stem. Between your palms, roll a small circle of clay, about the same size as the thinner area of the brain stem. Roll a small rope and attach this to the bottom of your cerebellum, which will be pressed against the right side of the brain stem.Pinch a portion of the clay at the bottom of the cerebellum to give you something to attach the ropes to.

, Lay the pieces against the right side of the brain stem, along the pons and slightly covering some of the stem. Gently press the two pieces together until they stick. Connect the small rope with one side running down the shaft of the brain stem, and the other running upward over the pons.

The cerebellum has many small lines running horizontally. These are much thinner and close together than the pattern of the rest of the outer surface. Take a knife or sharp pencil to draw these lines across the cerebellum.

, Make a small slug using the clay. The length should roughly match the length of the brain stem. Press one end onto the top of the brainstem and curve the rest to create a backward “c” so the the tail nearly meets the head which is connected to the brain stem.The top of the brain stem should be completely covered.
For added realism, use a pointed tool to draw vertical lines on the portion of the hippocampus connecting to the brain stem.

, Pinch off a blob of clay that is just large enough to fit into the gap created by the curve of the hippocampus. Roll it into a circle and place it directly inside this gap.This will also assist in maintaining the curve of the hippocampus in your model.

, Roll slightly less clay than you used for the hippocampus to create the corpus callosum. Make a long rope roughly the same thickness as the ""tail"" of the hippocampus. Position it so that it lies directly on top of this curved portion of the hippocampus.


The left end should touch the bottom ""head"" of the hippocampus. The right end should touch the cerebellum.

, This is the largest portion of the brain which carries a pattern of folds. Create a dozen or so small ropes. Each one should be short and and about as thin as the rope portions of your cerebellum. You will need to attach small, curved ropes to one another and build them around the current curve of the brain.Curve one small rope on the top of the round portion of the cerebellum, but do not allow it to extend down to the side. Fold it around, stacking it on itself, so that it touches the corpus callosum and does not extend further right than the right side of the cerebellum.
Continue stacking, curving, and piecing the ropes together in a similar manner until you make your way around the corpus callosum and touches the left end of the hippocampus.
Use your finger or a clay shaping tool to smooth the outside of the cerebrum. This outer edge should be an even curve.

, Pinch off a small oval roughly one-third the size of the thalamus. Roll this into an oval, then wedge this oval into the front of the brain, in between the bottom edge of the cerebrum and the upper edge of the brain stem pons."

If you are doing clay animation, you will want to select an oil-based clay that will not dry out.;
, Instead of trying to mold a dog shape from a large chunk of clay, break apart the clay into several smaller pieces.









Keep one larger piece to create the torso of the dog.
Break off a piece for the head.
Make four pieces of equal size to create the legs. Roll the pieces into balls to try and keep the size as even as possible for each leg.
Make one smaller piece for the tail.
Set the remainder aside to use for other small shapes that remain, such as the ears and eyes.

, Form a cylindrical shape with the largest piece of clay. Roll some clay into a ball and shape it into a rectangle. Round the edges a little to make the rectangular body look like a dog body.









You may want to adjust the torso to be smaller or larger depending on the kind of dog you want to create. For example, a basset hound or dachshund will have a much longer body, but much shorter limbs.
If you are making a large sculpture, you may want to crumple up damp newspaper and mold the clay around it. This will save you clay, make the sculpture lighter and save you time when baking., You can shape a single piece by forming a pointed snout at the front and rounding the back. Or, you can shape a separate ball of clay for the snout and press it to the front of the face. Stick it on the top of the end of the body.









To keep the head in place you might want to insert a toothpick halfway into the body of the dog. Then, place the head on the top half of the toothpick.

, Flatten the bottoms and add pads with brown or black clay. Put two legs on the back of the dog, and two legs on the front.









Use the legs to help create the pose for your dog. You might want to make him stand, sit, or lie down. It is entirely up to you.

, Roll another piece of clay between your hands to create the tail. You might want to make it long and pointy, or short and stubby. It depends entirely on the kind of dog you want to create. Attach the tail to the rear of the dog.








, You will want to have ears, a snout, mouth, eyes, and a nose. You can use smaller pieces of clay to shape the pieces, or use your modeling tools to carve some of them into the existing form. The more time you take creating details, the more lifelike your dog will be.









Consider adding a tongue. Add a small piece of thin clay out the side of your dog's mouth.
Try pressing two small lines into each paw to create some toes.
If you are using different colors of clay you can give your dogs some spots by adding small, thin patches of different colors over the body or legs.
Create a collar by forming a long flat strip and wrapping it around the neck of the dog.

, Check the instructions for your polymer clay to find the right temperature and time for the type of clay and the size of your clay dog.









Polymer clays will all cook at a temperature between 215°F (102°C) to 325°F (163°C)., Wait until the oven reaches the desired temperature. Place the tile with the dog on it on the middle rack of your oven.








, Follow the cooking times suggested by the manufacturer for your type of clay. The larger your clay dog is, the longer it will take you to cook it in the oven.







, Certain ovens use rapid heating systems that can create dips and spikes in the temperature. You should try to monitor the temperature in the oven to make sure your clay isn't getting too hot or not hot enough. Too cold and your clay may become brittle, too hot and you may end up burning the clay.







, When the timer goes off take out your clay dog. Leave the dog to cool on the ceramic tile. Don't worry if the clay doesn't appear firm when you first remove it from the oven. As the clay cools down it will harden.









Use oven mitts when handling the tile. It will be hot.

, You don't need to wash or sand your clay beforehand. Just brush on your base coat. Then add as much or little detail as you like.









Select the colors that suit your type of dog. You might use mainly brown and black for a rottweiler, or white and black for a dalmatian.
Avoid spray-on paints as they contain a solvent that can degrade your clay.

, It may take 15-20 minutes to dry from the time you finish painting.








, Use a different brush to apply the varnish. This will give your clay dog a nice glossy finish. The coat of varnish will seal in the paint and help protect it from chipping.

Start by kneading the clay into a ball.,
Pull out the various appendages: Four more-or-less equal legs, a longer tail and a fatter head.,
Keep sculpting until it's a plausible cat shape.,
Keep making the tail more tail-like, keep making the head more cat-like, and hopefully a personality will emerge, whether through design or of its own accord.

,
Roll out a sausage of glow-in-the-dark clay for the eyes (it’s easier to divide a sausage evenly).,
Split the sausage into two equal parts and roll them into balls.,
Attach the balls to the front of the head, and presto!,
Split a very small black sausage of clay in half and roll up the pieces to make the pupils.,
Give the cat eyelids (optional).,
Shape the lids into rough semicircles and carefully affix them at a precise angle.,
Carefully concentrate on the details of its body language.,
Take care to make the texture of the piece as smooth as you want it with gentle rubbing, and correct any minor flaws.,Finished.,
""To make a ball cat, you need to have one main colour.,
"" Now you have the ears, put the four balls on the other side of them - make it look like a cat car with no windows. "",
"" Next, make a fat sausage for the tail if you want it to look bushy and more like an original ball cat.,
""Now we need to do the eyes.,
""Voila!",How to Make Polymer Clay Cats," Squish and roll it and warm it until is is a soft pliable consistency. Make it spherical and work it from there.

, Give the head a couple of ears, and it should already be starting to look a little bit like a cat.

, It might even have some personality - if so, you might like to go with it.

,, Surprise cat eyes glowing in the dark are amusing but use your own personal preference.

, Work carefully on the eyes, as they are the single most important part of almost any critter. Every little change or move can change the look. For example, unevenly sized eyeballs give an air of derangement. So take care when working with them but be prepared for them to surprise you.

, You now have a cat that can stare at people.

, Attach them to the eyes. This is one of the most delicate parts of the whole process, because the amount of clay involved is so tiny and black; you may need to use a sculpting tool or a blunt knife to attach them to the eyeballs.

, You can give the cat upper and lower lids, or stick with just upper lids. Make them from a semi-circle of clay, created by forming a ball, then squashing and halving it.

, The way that the lids are attached can easily make the difference between a critter which is sweetly looking for affection, and one which is brimming over with malevolence.Take care in attaching them

, Make the cat look the way your imagination and artistic nature take you.


A tail is a beautifully expressive thing. For instance, when a cat is mad, it is moving slowly.
The set of a cat’s ears and the angle of its head can tell you a great deal.
The way it is standing is crucial.

, Then place it on a baking tray, laying it on its side or supporting it around the middle, because unbaked polymer clay legs are flimsy, and become softer while being baked. Place the tray in an oven preheated to 130° C (265°F), and bake for 20-30 minutes according to the instructions that come with the clay.

,, Use this to make 2 big balls, then chop the smaller one into sixths. Make four of them balls again. The other 2 should be slightly triangular. Put them on the intact ball."";
,

, If not, then do a tail like a thin worm. Put it on, and make sure that it is smoothed on.""

",How to Make a Clay Cat," Get the clay colors that speak to you when you envision the cat. Good choices might be brown, black, pink, red, and yellow clay. You will add interest by creating details with tools such as forks, plastic knives, garlic pressers, whatever your imagination brings forward. The varied textures and colors will make your creature eye-catching.;
, This will be the body. Roll the brown clay in a big ball. Then squeeze the top sides a little to create an egg-shaped body.


To add more detail to the belly, flatten a piece of pink clay into an egg shape, a bit smaller than the body. Then stick it on body for the stomach.

, Use something to keep it in place, such as a toothpick, when you stick it on top of the body.

, Put them next to each other on the bottom of the head (not all the way at the bottom). Add a very small ball under the cheeks in the middle.

,, You don't really need to make a mouth though because the snout forms the mouth.

, Put some pink clay inside the holes and stick the ears on top of the head.

, You can also stick in string to make whiskers.

, Bend a little at the front to make paws. Add claws by pushing a line down on each paw with a toothpick three times. Stick them on the front of the clay cat.


Do the same method with the legs, but stick them in the back.
Add pads on the arms and legs to add more detail, but you don't have to if you don't want to.

Choose suitable clay.,
Choose a color for the cap of the mushroom.,
Choose a color for the stem of the mushroom.,
Decorate the mushroom.,
Check the clay package or wrapping for heating instructions and information.,
After putting the clay into the oven, keep an eye on it.,
Take the mushroom out of the oven when baked enough.,
Decide what to do with the mushroom(s).",How to Make Clay Mushrooms," You can use any kind, from the type that needs glazing to Fimo, just so long as it will be durable enough for your end purposes.;
, Mold it into a shape that resembles a shallow cup.

, Roll the stem of the mushroom into a medium sized cylindrical shape with rounded edges. Braid the stem, as it allows you to use two color choices, which can add to the interest.


Note that tan is a good color choice for a stem, as it matches easily with almost any other color.

, It can be as simple as adding spots to the mushroom cap or more detailed. Cut little windows for the stem or have little people sit on top of the mushroom.

, This is to ensure the clay figure becomes hard. What is required for baking will vary depending on what clay you are using and how large your sculpture piece is.


To keep the mushroom from getting squished in the baking process, bake the cap and the stem separately, side by side with some space between. Then attach them with strong glue––super glue works well.

, Clay can burn if baked for too long.

, Let it cool before you handle it.

, The clay mushroom can be used as a display item, a gift, an item for your garden or anything else you can think of!

Take the gnome’s exact measurements.,
Study your husband’s characteristics.,
Draw a basic plan on paper of how you envisage transforming the gnome into your husband.,
Search for mini-replicas of your husband’s distinct characteristics or items.,

Improvise with clothing or accessories to obtain the desired result.,
Assemble the husband-like gnome.,
Place the husband-like gnome in your garden or on your lawn.",How to Make a Garden Gnome That Looks Like Your Husband," If you plan to add some cute accessories to make your gnome resemble your betrothed, a standard ""common garden variety"" gnome will do the trick. Generally, most home and garden stores carry the typical garden gnome. However, hobby stores and specialty websites may also carry theme-based garden gnomes including bikers, soldiers, firemen and more. And don't forget to check online, although shipping costs may make such a purchase less desirable.


If your husband already looks like a garden gnome, complete with trimmed beard and snub nose, then look for one that seems most representative of his look already.
If the gnome has a beard (many do) and your husband does not, don't worry too much. Some artist's license is permissible here; after all, you're making a gnome representation of your husband and if that happens to also include a beard, then so be it.;
, To ensure you can customize this gnome to look like your hubby, you’ll need to get the gnome's height, overall width, hat size and head size. Make a note of each measurement on a piece of paper for future reference when measuring clothing, hats, etc.

, Identify three or four characteristics that represent the distinctiveness of your husband. Is he a die-hard sports team fan and loves to wear his favorite jersey? Or does he wear glasses with unique frames? Perhaps he styles his hair in a certain way or has particularly prominent features worthy of a caricature. Selecting a few strong features will help you to personalize this garden gnome to best resemble your hubby.


As well as characteristics, don't forget to think about items that represent him, such as sports gear, a briefcase, a work-related symbol like scales of justice for a lawyer or a plunger for a plumber, etc. Indeed, it may be his tools of trade that help identify him most clearly of all, or at least make him look twice!

, Take the characteristics and items that you've decided upon and plan where they'll be placed on the gnome. This exercise will help you to work out what needs to be found and purchased and what things you'll need to create from scratch. Don't spend too long on this step––a simple sketch of a stick figure gnome with arrows and instructions or pointers is sufficient.


You may work out at this stage that the gnome needs a little paintwork as well as adding clothes or accessories. Factor this into the process of making over the gnome.

, Look around the house for shirts, glasses, beard materials or other items that are free to be used and could be cut down to size to accommodate the gnome's size. For example, a shirt could be cut down to size and restitched into gnome size, while oversized glasses would still work as a caricature effect.


If you have children, look through their doll clothing, typically something that may fit an American Girl Doll or even a baby doll. You might need to dye the colors or change the outfit a bit to work; think laterally.
If you craft things, it's likely that you'll have the items or the materials to create accessories such as a beard, hair or glasses. Anything used for making dolls, decorations or miniatures will likely be of use.
Visit local retailers to purchase appropriate clothing or accessories for the garden gnome that you couldn't rummage up at home. With list of items you still need in hand, hit the local toy store first to see if they have any of the standard clothing or features. If you cannot complete your purchase at the toy store, the hobby and/or craft store should be your next stop. And even stores that stock items for cake decorating may be useful for miniatures such as bottles and sporting gear.

, Items you may need include a hot glue gun, wire scissors, needle and thread, Velcro and/or double sided tape.The types of materials you’ll need to build your gnome are dependent on what you intend doing to the gnome. For example, if your gnome is a football-jersey-wearing, beer-drinking gnome, choose the materials you’ll need to create the jersey and to affix a miniature glass or bottle of beer in the gnome’s hand. In the case of this example, the items needed may include a small white t-shirt, iron-on transfer paper (for the sports logo) or a fabric pen, hot glue gun or even super glue to keep the small bottle in the gnome’s hand.


Don't forget the potential of changing the way the gnome looks through the use of paint and markers. A mustache, a swirl or hair, a ruddy complexion, etc., can all be created through the use of drawing or painting directly onto the gnome.

, In some cases, you may not be able to find that University of Michigan jersey small enough for your garden gnome, for example. If that’s the case, purchase a small white t-shirt from either the toy or craft store and either freehand draw the logo using fabric pen paint or generate an iron-on transfer using graphics you can find online. Almost anything can be miniaturized with a little creative thinking.


Items such as glasses and studs can be created using strong craft wire.
Use yarn or special craft string for hair.
Colored cotton wool can serve as a beard.
Glue on real shoelaces to give the impression of strong work boots.
An old beloved shirt can be cut down to size, or even just a logo can be removed from an old piece of clothing and stitched to the gnome's clothing.

, Set aside an afternoon or evening to spend creating the gnome. Naturally, either keep your husband out of the way or rely on the reality that most husbands stop looking closely at what wives are doing when it comes to ""making craft"" to reassure yourself that he's not going to put two and two together to note what you're really up to. You could probably even ask him to hold a piece in place while you glue and he still wouldn't notice…


Create any items that need to be created by hand. For example, if you have to make the shirt, glasses, hair etc., create that first. Keep the gnome on hand to ensure sizing and fit is accurate. If you can't sew, use glue or get a friend to do any sewing needed.
Affix clothing or accessories that do not require glue first. That way you can start to get an idea of how your gnome will look without committing to the design with glue.
Glue or add remaining items to the gnome. You may want to hold the items up to the gnome first to make sure the accessories go exactly where they should--for example, if you are adding an item for the gnome to hold, hold it up to his hand to make sure you like how it is placed before you add glue.
Allow any glue used to dry on the gnome for two to three hours, or for the time specified by the glue instructions. To ensure everything stays in place allow the glue to dry so it doesn't fall apart when you place it in your garden.

, Find a strategic place in your garden such as by a fountain or next to a favorite plant. You could place it somewhere that he is bound to come across it regularly or somewhere that he is only likely to discover on the weekend when gardening or mowing the lawn; it's up to you and when you want the impact to occur. Don’t tell your husband that you’ve created his alter-ego to protect the garden. Instead, wait to see how long it takes for him to notice. When he does, provided he finds it funny, own up and have a good laugh together about the whole husband-like gnome thing. In fact, get a photo of the two of them together and post it online. Then wait for your turn as he plots to make a garden gnome that looks just like his wife…


If your husband doesn't have a sense of humor about it, tell him any resemblance to himself is a mere coincidence and that he is just flattering himself to think you'd take the time to make the gnome look anything like him.
If your husband really gets irritable about what you've done, either cause the gnome to disappear quickly or reshape its features completely. If you didn't already know your husband's level of tolerance for garden gnomes, you sure do now.

Soak clay in clear water using a container large enough that clay is totally under water.,
Never stir it.,
Wait.,
Drain water off.,
Firm it if needed.,
Prepare clay for proper storage.",How to Rework Ceramic Clay That Has Dried Out,";
, Stirring stops up the porosity and prevents good slaking (soaking to mush).

, In a few days, even the largest chunks of dry clay will turn into mush.

, When the clay has settled and turned to mush, remove extra water from top. Dip water off or siphon it off.

, You can stiffen the mush by allowing it to set for many months with the lid off. To dry it faster, spread the mush a few inches thick on clean dry porous surfaces. You can use dry plaster, clean concrete, canvas or denim. Smooth the top to avoid getting small dry pieces on the surface. For quicker drying, position a fan to blow air across clay.

, When it is nearly dry enough, make coils for future use. This clay can be stored in an airtight plastic, double-wrapping in sandwich bags if you expect to store it an extended length of time.

Store leftover clay in an airtight container.",How to Make Paper Clay," To make paper clay, you'll need toilet paper as well as a few supplies you can find at the hardware store. This recipe results in a smooth, malleable clay you can mold over any type of prepared form. It dries into a hard surface to which you can apply paint or varnish. Here's what you need:








1 roll of single ply toilet paper (not the kind with lotion, scent or color added)
1 cup premixed joint compound (do not buy it in powdered form; get ""regular"")
3/4 cup PVA glue (white school glue)
2 tablespoons mineral oil
1/2 cup white flour
2 large bowls
Electric mixer
Measuring cups;
, It's less messy to slip the entire roll of paper off of the cardboard roll at once, rather than unwinding the paper entirely. Place the toilet paper in one of the bowls.








, Pour it over the toilet paper until it's completely saturated. Push the toilet paper down into the water to make sure it all gets wet.








, Tear it off in smaller chunks (1 inch or less) so you can squeeze out as much water as possible. Place the pulpy chunks in a separate bowl so you can mix them with the other ingredients. Keep going until you've squeeze out all of the toilet paper.








, One roll of plain toilet paper typically equals a cup and a half of pulp. If your brand of toilet paper makes very small or large rolls, you might end up with less or more pulp than you need. Make more toilet paper pulp or discard the excess as needed, so you have 1 1/2 cups of pulp in the bowl.








, To the bowl with the pulp, add a cup of premixed joint compound, 3/4 cup white school glue, 2 tablespoons mineral oil, and 1/2 cup white flour.









Do not substitute these ingredients. Different types of glue, oil, flour, and so one will change the consistency of the paper clay and may not produce the results you want.

, Use your electric mixer to beat the clay at a high speed. The paper fibers will break down and blend with the joint compound, glue, oil and flour until it takes on a smooth, dough-like consistency.









If you want a thicker clay, mix in an extra half cup of flour.
For a thinner consistency, add an extra half cup of glue.

, Paper clay is used in place of paper mache strips, which are typically dipped in water and applied to a wire or masking tape sculpture form. Paper clay is used the exact same way, but with a neater, more professional finish. Prepare your sculpture form for its clay application.







, The paper clay will be spreadable, like icing, and you should be able to spread it directly onto the form for a smooth finish. Completely coat the form in clay, just as you would if you were using paper mache strips.









If you prefer to use thicker clay and sculpt with your fingers, follow the instructions above for adding extra flour to create a thicker consistency. Use your fingers, a spoon, and any other tools you want to coat your sculpture form in paper clay.
Let the first layer set. It will begin to harden into a tough outer coating upon which you can build using more paper clay.

, Apply extra layers of clay in places where you want your sculpture to look thick. Keep building layers, letting them set, and adding more as needed. You can add as many or as few layers as you want to your sculpture form. The more you add, the heavier your sculpture will be.








, For example, if you're sculpting a face, the paper clay will allow you to add intricate detail around the eyes, nose and mouth. Continue building the sculpture with your fingers and other sculpting tools until you're happy with the result.







, After a day or two it will be as hard as a rock. Don't apply paint or varnish until it's completely dry. Paper clay works well with any type of paint or varnish you wish to use.








, This will prevent it from drying out between uses. If kept in an airtight container, the clay will keep for several weeks.

Make a reindeer for Christmas or winter.",How to Make Salt Dough Handprints," Pour the flour and the salt into a large bowl. Stir them together with a spoon until they are well-mixed.





;
, This is not completely necessary, but it will add a little extra sparkle to your finished piece. Start with a spoonful, then add more as desired. You can use extra-fine scrapbooking glitter, or chunky, crafting glitter.


Keep in mind that, if you paint the handprint later, the glitter will get covered up. If this concerns you, save some glitter so that you can mix it into the paint later.

, Pour a little bit of warm water into the bowl, and stir it together with a mixing spoon. Keep doing this until you have a dough-like consistency. You may or may not end up using all of the water.








Add a few drops of food coloring into the water if you want a pastel color.
Mix 1 part water, and 1 part acrylic or tempera paint if you want a bolder color., As you continue to knead the dough, it will become smoother and less sticky. If you added paint or food coloring to your dough, be careful; the color may stain your hands!







, It would be easiest to do this with a rolling pin, but if you don't have one, you can use a glass, bottle, or jar instead. You want it to be about ½ to ¾-inch (1.27 to 1.91-centimeter) thick.








, You can keep the fingers close together, or have them spread apart. Press your hand (or your child's hand) into the dough. You want to press firmly enough to make a print, but not so firmly that the dough becomes paper-thin.









Consider adding a name and date. This is a great idea to help you remember your little one's first Christmas, Thanksgiving, or other holiday.

, Here is where you can get really creative. You can cut the handprint out as a circle, square, or oval. You can also cut out a glove shape instead. If you are careful, you can even trace around the hand, leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border around the hand.








, You can make the hole using just about anything: a straw, toothpick, skewer, lollipop stick, or even a knitting needle.








, If you colored your salt dough earlier, be aware that the color may fade as it dries. You can still paint the salt dough after it dries, however. Place the handprint on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, then do one of the following:


Leave the handprint out in a warm place for a few days. If the handprint is very thick, you may want to turn it over every so often; this will help it dry faster.Bake the ornaments in the oven at 215°F (100°C) for 2 to 3 hours.If the handprint is very thin, check on it after 45 to 60 minutes., You do not have to paint the handprint, but it can help make it look more unique. Keep in mind that the paint will cover up any glitter you added into the dough. If this bothers you, mix a little bit of your glitter into the paint you are using.









Use some metallic or glitter paint for something extra special.
If you carved in a name and/or date, you could fill the letters in with paint and a thin paintbrush.

, There is no such thing as too much glitter! You can paint the entire handprint with a thin layer of white school glue, then shake some glitter on top of it. You can also draw designs using glitter glue pens instead.









If you can't find any glitter glue pens: draw some designs using white school glue, then shake some glitter onto the glue. Gently tap off the excess glitter when you are done.
If you don't want to add any more glitter, then you can skip this step.

, You can do this using a decoupage-type glue, such as Mod Podge. You can also seal it with a paint-on or spray-on acrylic sealer. This will help make your handprint last longer.








If you added glitter, make sure that you use a glossy finish, or you will dull the glitter's sparkle.

, You can glue these on using hot glue or white school glue. You might not want to cover up the handprint, but they'd look lovely glued around the border!

, You can use baker's twine, jute string, yarn, or even satin ribbon for this. Match your string to the style of the handprint. For example, if you made a rustic-looking handprint, yarn or jute string would look great. If your handprint is glittery and sparkly, with lots of gemstones, try gold or silver ribbon instead.

, Keep your fingers close together when making the handprint. Cut the ""tree"" out leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border, and poke a hole near the top for the ribbon. After the dough dries, paint the tree green, then add red and gold ornaments using your finger tips (or a Q-tip if you don't want to get messy). Don't forget to add the trunk! Once the paint and sealer dry, thread a red, green, or gold ribbon through the hole.For an extra special tree, dye the dough green and add some green glitter first. Use a darker shade of green when painting the tree.If you like sparkly things, glue on red and yellow gemstones for the ornaments instead of painting them.

, Make your dough and handprint first. Cut the handprint out so that it is shaped like a mitten. Next, use a star, heart, circle, or square-shaped cookie cutter to cut out a hole in the palm. Make a hole near the top of the handprint, then let it dry. Once the dough is dry, glue a photo to the back.Consider adding the person's name and the year which the ornament was made.

, Keep your fingers apart when making the handprint. Cut the ""bird"" out leaving a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the thumb for the string. Let the dough dry, then turn the handprint sideways so that the thumb (quill/crest) is at top and the fingers (tail feathers) are to the side. Here are some ways in which you can paint your bird:


For a cardinal: paint the palm area red, and the thumb and fingers a dark red. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the orange beak and black feet!
Blue jay: paint the palm area white, and the thumb and fingers blue. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the black beak and feet!
Robin: paint the palm area red, and the thumb and fingers a grey or tan. Add a black eye just below the thumb. Don't forget the yellow beak and black feet!

, Keep your fingers spread apart when making the handprint. Cut the ""turkey"" out with a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the fingers for the string. Let the dough dry. Keeping the hand upright, paint the handprint as follows:


Paint palm and thumb brown.
Paint the fingers red, orange, and yellow.
Add a beak and eyes to thumb.
Add feet to bottom of the palm.

, Keep your fingers apart when making the handprint. Cut the handprint out, either as an oval, or with a ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) border. Make a hole just above the fingers, then let the handprint dry. Paint the handprint as follows:


Paint the palm brown.
Paint the fingers and thumb light brown or tan.
Paint some eyes near top of palm, or glue on a pair of googly eyes.
Paint a red or black nose near bottom of palm. If you'd like, you can add a smile too.

For the purposes of sculpting an amateur mini-dragon, you might consider using Sculpey®, Souffle®, or Premo® polymer clay.If you plan on giving your dragon some color or highlighting its features, like it's eyes and wings, you'll also want a spray paint primer and some paint for your hardened clay.Acrylic paints are recommended by many clay artists for painting baked polymer clay.Aluminum knitting needles are also useful tools for styling and adding details to your clay dragon. Finer needles can be used for finer detail designs, like the features of your dragon's face.;
, Fresh from the packaging, your clay might seem stiff and difficult to mold. To limber your clay and ready it for sculpting, you'll want to tear it into pieces and knead it in your hands.


Your hands will warm your clay, softening it and making it easier to work with. Sculpting clay is intended to be worked with in this fashion.
The size of the dragon you intend to make will determine how much clay you use. However, a surprisingly small amount of clay goes a long way, and you can always add more clay if necessary.

, The warmed clay should shape more easily now that you've finished activating it. Smooth out the surface of your clay ball and create a general sphere shape with it.

, From your central ball of clay you are going to pull out your dragon's limbs. Do this by pinching out four legs at regular intervals without separating it from your clay ball.Flatten the limbs and bottom of your ball to create a solid base.
Thick legs will create a more solid shape and will prevent your dragon's limbs from breaking free of its body.
Feel free to adjust limbs as needed. For example, you may need to push the legs a little more closely together or pull more clay from your clay ball to give the limbs stability.

, Pull some clay from your limbed clay ball forward for the neck and head of your dragon.Make sure the base of your dragon's neck is thick enough to support the head and the length of the neck. A stout, short neck can be easier to accomplish for beginner level sculptors.


At the end of your neck, you can fold down the end of the clay to form a head.
Dragons typically have serpentine features, so the head of your dragon will likely be triangular in shape, ending in a point.

, Tease some clay from your central ball to the back to create a tail. A thick base connecting your tail to its body will create sturdiness in the finished product. Avoid making your tail too long, as this can crack during backing or harden in a way that is brittle and delicate.Push down slightly on the base of your tail to give the effect that the tail is coming out from between the dragon's legs, and not from the top of your clay ball, which will eventually turn into the back of your dragon.

, Wings can be tricky, and while learning the basics of sculpting you may want to keep your wings thick and small.Create your wings by pulling some clay from either side of the top of your clay ball. If you find that you need more clay, knead a small piece and use your thumb to blend the new clay with that of your clay ball, and then work this clay into the simple shape of a wing on both sides.


Thick wings will keep the clay from cracking there when you bake it and will result in a sturdier sculpture.
The wings, being such a delicate part of the sculpture, are the most fragile and breakable part of the dragon. Exercise care while forming these.

, Your dragon may be a hornless variety, but if you had planned on making a horned dragon, take a small amount of surplus clay and knead it in your hands. Then, shape two cones for your horns and lightly press each into the head of your dragon.


Use a little water to dampen the base of your cones. This can help keep your horns in place., It's likely that your clay ball is still mostly round at this point, with limbs, head, tail, wings, and horns attached. However, the bodies of dragons are usually more elongated and oval in shape. Press gently on the rounded sides of your clay ball to squish the circular shape into a longer oval one., This can be done by:


Kneading some extra clay.
Pulling off little pieces.
Rolling tiny cones, damping the base of the cones, and pressing the cones along the spine of the dragon.
Adding a contour line with your knitting needles to either side of the spine.

, Dragons, in most mythologies, have bat-like wings. These often come to a point at the highest point and have some bones dividing the wings into parts or sections. Using your finest knitting needle, you should carefully:


Trace a line along the inside of the outer boundary of your wing.
Add lines from the top of the wing to the bottom of the wing, splitting each into regular sections.
Avoid thinning your wings too much or applying too much pressure. Thin clay cracks easily when baked or after being baked, and even well formed wings will be delicate., The small size of this amateur model will limit the amount of detail you are adding unless you have a very steady hand and very precise needles.However, you should be able to use your knitting needles to gently carve out the shape of two eyes and a mouth line around the outer rim of your triangular head.

, ""Firing"" refers to the process of heating clay until it sets permanently int he shape it is formed. This is usually done in a kiln, but your polymer clay can be baked in your oven. Check the temperature at which your clay should be baked as listed on the label or instructions your clay came with.


Pre-heat your oven first. Putting your clay in the oven before it is at the target heat can have a negative impact on the firing process.
Watch the dragon while it is baking. The wings, legs, tail, and sometimes the head can burn. This is especially important if you're not going to paint the dragon, as the burning will be visible.

, The length of time you should bake your dragon at should also be indicated on the label or instructions that came with your clay. Set a timer so you don't forget to remove your dragon; baking it too long can cause it to crack!


While you are waiting for your dragon to bake, you might put away your remaining clay according to the storage directions on its packaging.
Clean and put away your knitting needles.
Prepare your primer, painting area, and painting supplies.

, White is a great priming color. It offers a solid base that is high contrast, making it easy for you to see where you have already painted and where you have yet to paint. Primer will also help preserve your acrylic paint; clay can be very porous and may absorb a lot of paint without primer., If this is your first dragon, you might want to choose a single, bold color. This will help you get a feel for how the paint and clay interact, how quickly it dries, where it collects, clumps, and trouble areas as well.


After you have painted your solid base, allow your paint to dry fully.

, Look at your dragon from various angles. Where you notice naturally occurring shadows and contours, you can add a thin line in black to give sharper contrast. A little black on the downward-facing areas of your dragon will give the impression of shadow, making your model look more realistic.


Depending on how much or little contour, contrast, or shading you have added, you may have to wait for the paint to dry before moving on.

, Make these as detailed or as abstract as you'd like. You can leave white primer visible for the whites of your dragon's eyes and add a dot of black complete the eye, but you could also glue googly eyes.


Allow any wet paint to dry fully.

, Now that you've sculpted, fired, and painted your very own dragon, you should show it to your friends and get some pointers. Refine these basic methods and use them to make larger, more intricate models.

Process, blend or mash up the pieces of white bread.,
Put the pieces of bread into a bowl.,
Knead the dough on a clean surface.,
Make clay projects.,
Decorate the cooled beads or shapes with paint or markers as desired.

",How to Make Modelling Clay from White Bread1," Break it down into small pieces or crumbs. Hand ripping is fine too!;
, Add the necessary amount of salt and water. Mix.

, When pliable and adhering together, it is ready to use.

, The bread is ideal for making beads, figurines and other small clay projects. To make beads:


Shape the bread into beads.
Pierce each bead at the end of a skewer and thread it along the skewer.
Bake in a slow oven (around 130ºC/250ºF) until firmed. If you have made other shapes, bake them at the same temperature also.

Have your child rip one slice of bread into tiny pieces into a bowl.,
Roll a bit of the mix between your fingers to check its consistency.,
Have your child can gather the dough into a ball.,
Make things.",How to Make Modelling Clay from White Bread2," Add the white glue to the bread crumbs, and mix with a fork until all the crumbs are moistened.

, This will vary depending on the dryness of your bread. The mix should be pliable and somewhat sticky. If it feels very wet, or too gummy to roll into a ball, tear up and mix in a little more bread.

, Knead it for a minute or two with his fingers or rolling it between his palms. Soon the dough will become elastic and satin like.


As your child models the dough, it may begin to dry out. If it does, he can dip his fingertips in water (have a small bowl at the worktable) and knead the dough until it becomes more pliable.

, Unlike many homemade doughs, this recipe has a fine, elastic texture that won't crack, even during intricate modeling projects like earrings, buttons, beads or tiny figurines. Bread dough also is a great medium for taking impressions: A small piece pressed against the outside of a favorite shell makes a beautiful pendant or faux fossil. To add a hard, semigloss finish, your child can mix equal parts water and white glue and brush on several coats.


Drying time: White bread dough air-dries in 1 to 3 days.

",How to Make Clay from Indigenous Soil," Ideally, you will collect your soil from beneath the topsoil. The topsoil is usually two to eight inches (five to twenty centimetres) deep and contains a higher concentration of contaminants. Avoiding this top layer of soil will help eliminate organic debris such as living plants, roots, and insects. The more soil you collect, the more clay you can make., The size of the container will depend on how much soil you are using. Fill the container about two-thirds full of soil. Try to avoid using bottlenecked containers, as they may make it harder to pour contents out in later steps.To help eliminate debris you could sift the soil before adding it to the container. However, this is not necessary.

, You can use water straight from your tap. Be sure to thoroughly stir the mixture. You should eliminate all clumps and have an even mixture of water and soil., The clay will separate from the sediment and be suspended in the water. The ‘clay water’ will float on top of the sediment. Be careful not to shake the container or stir the sediment that now rests at the bottom., Be careful not to pour any sediment into your new container. Once you see the sediment reach the lip of the original container stop pouring. Once you have poured off the clay water, you can discard the sediment., Add water, stir the mixture, let it set, and pour the clay water into another container. Each time you do this, the clay will be more pure. Ideally, you will continue the process until you see no sediment at the bottom., Since the clay is just suspended in the water and not highly soluble, it will settle at the bottom if left alone. The clay water will need to sit for at least twenty-four hours. The water and clay will form two separate layers. You will be able to tell when this happens because the water will be clear.If you still see a layer of sediment below the clay repeat the steps to remove the sediment.

, Once you see the clay reach the lip of the container, stop pouring. The clay will be soft and saturated with water. If you pour it out, you will have to start over., As the clay settles, even more water will move up and create another top water layer. Pour the clear water off of the clay again. Once the clay reaches the lip of the container, stop pouring.You can repeat this process until the water is no longer forming a substantial layer.

, Lay the cloth over a bowl to help guide the runny clay into the cloth. The cloth must be large enough to encompass all of the clay in your container. The cloth will act as a bag for the clay. Tie the cloth with a piece of string as though you are creating a ball of clay inside the cloth.Any cloth will do. You can use an old t-shirt or bedsheet. Be sure to use something that you don’t mind getting dirty.
You can split the clay into multiple cloths to speed up the hardening process.

, This will allow water to drip from the fabric. As the water leaves the clay, the clay will harden. This process can take two or three daysBe sure to hang it somewhere where you don’t mind water dripping. You could hang it from a tree or your porch.
After a couple of days check the consistency of the clay. Different projects require different consistency. If you need it to be harder, let it hang longer.

Transfer the pot to the stove.,
Continue stirring the mixture until it resembles mashed potatoes.,
Add a small squirt of mineral oil to the mushy clay.,
Transfer the clay to the countertop to work and knead.,
Knead the dough until it's smooth.,
Store the finished clay in a re-sealable freezer bag that can be kept in the refrigerator.,
Use your dough to create something.",How to Make Homemade Polymer Clay Substitute1," This clay behaves the most like commercial polymer clay, but it might shrink (polymer clay doesn't shrink). It can shrink up to 30% by weight, not in size. Be aware of this when working on projects.


You may want to build your project a bit bigger so that when it shrinks it will be the correct size.;
, The pot should be either sitting on the counter during this step or if it is perched on the stove, make sure the flame is not on. Stir well until fully combined.


PVA wood glue works best for this recipe although the normal white children’s glue will work well also. The children’s glue may result in clay that is a bit weaker than clay made with wood glue.

, Stir well until completely blended. If you cannot find pure mineral oil then you can use petroleum oil (not jelly) or baby oil as a substitute.


If you want, you can add food coloring or acrylic paint to the mixture at this point to color it. Be careful not to add too much paint or else you could change the texture. If you want vibrant colors then you should simply paint your creation once it is made.

, Simmer over low heat/flame. As you heat up the stove, stir constantly to keep the liquid ingredients moving. Don't let the mixture sit still, as this will compromise the integrity of the clay’s texture.

, Once it turns to the mashed potato consistency, it’s time to remove from the heat/flame and place onto a cool/flat surface.


Consider placing a hot pad or towel on the counter to protect your countertops.

, The oil will coat and grease your hands as you knead it so that it does not stick to your hands.

, You should do this while it is as hot as possible, as long as your hands can handle the temperature.


You can also use either rubber or work gloves to protect your hands.

, The consistency should appear like well-worked pizza dough and be completely blended together. Roll into a ball when finished.

, To keep clay fresh and avoid having it harden, remove as much air as possible before sealing the bag and storing it.


If the clay is still warm, place in the bag but leave a small amount of the bag open. Once it has cooled completely, then you can seal and store it.

, Now that you have made your dough, you can use it to create anything you choose. When working with the dough it helps to put a little hand cream on your hands to allow you to smooth the clay easily.


Allow your creation to dry for at least 24 hours, or more if it is not yet dry.
Paint with your choice of paint. Tempera paint works well but other types will work as well.
You should paint even those areas that you want to remain white because it can start to look translucent if you do not.

Add the cornstarch little by little and keep stirring.,
Knead the clay for about 20 minutes.,
Store the clay in a sealed plastic bag.",How to Make Homemade Polymer Clay Substitute4," This recipe involves additional ingredients but it results in very strong clay that can be dropped from one meter high and not break., Mix 1 cup PVA glue, ½ tablespoon stearin (stearic acid), 1 ½ tablespoon glycerin, 1 ½ tablespoon Vaseline and ½ tablespoon citric acid in a non-stick pot over low heat. Mix completely.


Use the lowest heat possible to heat up the pot.

, Add the ½ cup cornstarch little by little into the mixture, stirring the whole time. Adding the cornstarch little by little prevents lumps from forming. Keep mixing the clay until you can lift the clay up from the pan.


It will get stickier and stickier and then heavier and very hard to stir but you must continue until you can lift it out of the pan.

, Place the clay on a table on top of non-stick paper (baking paper). It should be hot, a little sticky and a little lumpy. Knead the clay for about 20 minutes until all the lumps disappear and the clay becomes smooth and no longer sticky.

The bottom of the bowl should not be touching the water. Turn the stove on and let the water come to a boil. Lower the heat and let the water simmer.

, You will need this as soon as your finish heating the clay.

, Break the sheet of beeswax into smaller pieces. This will help the beeswax melt faster. Place the pieces into the bowl and heat until the wax is completely liquid and translucent. The beeswax will prevent the clay from ever drying out, making it similar to plasticine.

, Slowly pour ¾ cup (135 grams) of limestone powder into the wax. The mixture will be a little lumpy, so you will need to stir it until all of the lumps and clumps disappear.

, You will need 4 tablespoons of petroleum jelly, 6 teaspoons of baby oil, and 2 tablespoons coconut oil. Stir the mixture for 30 seconds.

, The clay will will be dull tan color once you finish making it. You can make it more colorful by adding in 1 tablespoon of powdered color pigment to the mixture and stirring to combine it., Once the 30 seconds have passed, take the bowl off of the pot and pour the mixture into the baking sheet. It will start to harden quickly.

, The clay will start to harden after about 10 minutes. During this time, you can test the texture and add more ingredients to resolve any issues.


If the texture is too crumbly, add in some more oil and stir to combine it. The oil will help soften the clay and make it less dry.
If the clay is too hard, transfer it back to the double boiler and let it soften. Add more of the oils and limestone powder.

, Because the clay is made from oils and wax, it will never dry out or completely harden. Once it cools, you can take it off the tray and sculpt with it.

, Although the clay will not dry out or harden like most other clays, it can still collect dust and dirt. Keep your clay looking clean by wrapping it in plastic wrap, sticking it in a plastic bag, or storing it in an air-tight container. Keep the clay in a cool place, as heat may cause it to soften and become sticky.

Determine the type of project you are using air drying clay for.,
Choose paper-based air drying clay for larger projects.,
Choose resin-based air drying clay for smaller projects like jewelry.,
Buy your clay.,
Open your clay.,
Knead your clay until it is soft.,
Shape your clay.,
Decorate your clay.,
Store your excess clay.,
Dry your clay.,
Check if the clay is dry.,
Remove the clay from the drying area.,
Decorate your clay.",How to Use Air Drying Clay," There are different types of air drying clay that are ideally suited for different purposes.You'll need to know what you are using the clay for, in order to determine which type of clay is right for you. These are other questions you should ask yourself:


How big is my final product going to be?
How heavy do I want my final product to be?
How much money can I spend on my clay?
Do I want my clay to have a heftier, ""premium"" feel (usually applies to jewelry/trinkets/beads)?;
, Usually, larger projects will benefit from paper clay. Since they require a lot of material, you'll save money. The finished project will also be much lighter.


Paper based clay feels fluffy to work with, but is hard and light when it dries.Paper based clay will be fluffy and chunks of it will break off in similar fashion to cotton candy., Equally strong, resin based clay (sometimes called porcelain based clay) is much denser, and when it is dried seems much more similar to baked polymer clay. It is also much more expensive and heavier.Smaller projects like jewelry or beads benefit from the ""premium"" feel of resin or porcelain based clay.Resin based clay is denser and will pull apart like fudge, caramel, or toffee., After you've determined what type of clay you want to purchase, you'll need to go out and buy it. Be sure that you buy enough for your project, but don't buy too much. Opened clay is hard to store and can easily become hard to work with and useless. . You can purchase your clay locally at a arts and crafts store, or purchase it online.


If you still aren't sure what type of clay to use, or want advice on your project, some stores have clerks that can answer your questions, and even offer classes.Purchasing your clay online will usually give you better prices and options, but you may have to wait several days for it to arrive.

, Begin working over a smooth, clean, nonporous surface. Open your sealed bag of clay and pinch off the amount of clay that you want to use. If your project is larger and you need several bags of clay, only open one for now.


You can use a wire or floss to ""cut"" chunks of clay off of a block. This is useful for accurately measuring how much you are using.

, Kneading and massaging the clay will soften it and make it easier to work with. The warmth of your hands will spread to the clay and make it malleable. Conditioning the clay is essential for proper use. If you planned to work with multiple bags of clay, knead them one at a time.


If using multiple bags for one piece, knead the clay together after each bag of clay has been warmed and kneaded separately.
If using paper based clay, you can add a small amount of water to additionally soften the clay. Resin based clay can be softened (and colored!) with acrylic paint. , Both three dimensional and flat figures are easy to make with air drying clay. Use your hands and tools like knives, spoons, or even spinning wheels to form and shape the clay as you desire.


Crafting tools (or even dental picks and equipment!) can be very useful for creating more complex projects, as you can be much more exact with them.If you are making a larger project that needs to stand up such as a vase, make sure that it has a large, flat base.

, You can press beads, yard, or even other pieces of clay into your project. Be sure to be careful, as you'll need to use enough pressure to press your decoration into the clay without changing or squashing your project. , Since clay spoils easily once it has been opened, ideally you'll have used it all. If not, leftover clay can be tightly wrapped in wax paper and stored in a plastic bag. It won't be as simple to work with or as useful afterwards though.Tough excess clay can sometimes be saved by (carefully) using a microwave to warm the clay up.

, Find a clean, smooth, nonporous surface where your clay can dry for 24 hours. Put your clay down and do not disturb or move the clay while it dries. You'll need to be patient to make sure that you don't ruin your project.


A cool, dry area (one with low humidity) is best. Mild air circulation is also helpful.
Thicker projects (over 1cm) may take even longer to dry.Better to be safe than sorry.

, After 24 hours the clay should definitely be dry to the touch, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it is ready. If your clay project is thick you may want to give it some extra time. There are other ways to visually evaluate if your clay is ready as well.


Resin based clay turns darker and more translucent.Paper based clay will stay very opaque.

, Once it is dry, carefully remove the clay from the drying area and take it back to your work area. You may want to lay down some newspapers or an old sheet. Be careful, while the clay will be hard it may be quite brittle. Don't drop it and risk breaking it.

, If desired, you can decorate your project further! Tempera, acrylic, and watercolor paints can be used on dry clay projects.You can also use glue to attach beads, sequins, fabric, and other fun decorations to your clay project.

Work the elastic into the hem.,
Sew the elastic ends together and close the gap.",How to Insert Elastic Into Pant Legs1," To create a casing for your elastic, you will need to hem your pants so that the elastic will have somewhere to go through. Start by folding over the bottom of your pants twice.Make sure that the area you fold over is wide enough for your elastic to fit into. Hold your elastic up against it to be sure.;
, Next, sew along the edge of the hem to secure the casing. Make sure to leave a small gap in the opening that you can insert the elastic into when you are done.If you are inserting elastic into a pair of pants that has already been completed and has a wide enough hem to fit elastic into, then you will need to cut a small hole into the inside of the hem. Use a pair of scissors to snip a small slit across the inner layer of the hem and use this opening to insert your elastic into.

, When your casing is complete, attach a safety pin to the end of the elastic strip and secure it. Attaching a safety pin to the end of the elastic strip will provide an anchor for your elastic and make it easier to work it through your pant legs.Make sure that you attach the safety pin far enough away from the end of the elastic so that it will not slip out. You may even want to insert the pin through a couple of places in the elastic to be certain that it is secure., To work the elastic into the hem, insert the closed safety pin into the opening in your pant leg hem. Then, begin to work the elastic through the hem using the safety pin to move it along.You will have to work slowly and move the safety pin through the hem just a little at a time. This may be easier or harder depending on the size of your casing and the material of your pants.

, When you get to the end, pull the safety pin out the other side and then remove it. Sew the two ends of your elastic band together by hand or using a sewing machine. Then, use the sewing machine or a needle and thread to close up the opening that you inserted the elastic through.


Repeat the same process for the other pant leg.

",How to Insert Elastic Into Pant Legs2," To determine how much elastic to insert into your pant leg, try measuring the elastic around your ankle or around the ankle of the person who will wear the pants. This will help to ensure that your elastic pant leg hem will be a good fit. Wrap the elastic around the ankle without stretching it and then cut it about an inch past the area where the two ends meet.Keep in mind that you do not want to make your elastic bands too tight or too loose. Aim for a comfortable fit.

, As you work the elastic through the hem, make sure that the elastic does not get twisted. This could affect the look of your finished project.If the elastic does get twisted, then try to untwist it. If you cannot get it untwisted, then you may need to start over and try again.

, Using a larger safety pin may make your work go faster, but you cannot always use a large safety pin. The size of your casing will determine what size safety pin you can use. If you have wide casing, then you can go with a larger safety pin. If you have a small casing, then go with a small safety pin., Make sure that the safety pin does not open while you are working it through the casing. If it does, try to fasten it again without snagging the fabric. If you cannot get it fastened again, then pull the elastic out and start over.,"

Trim any uneven edges or hanging threads.,
Thread a needle.,
Insert the needle into the corner of the fabric.,
Fold over the edge of your fabric.,
Insert the needle into fabric just below the raw edge.,
Go through the fabric near the top edge of the fold.,
Pull the thread after about three to five stitches.",How to Hand Stitch a Rolled Hem," It is important to make sure that the edge of your fabric is even and not frayed. Use a pair of sharp scissors to trim along the edge of your fabric as needed.To ensure a straight edge, you may want to trim about 1/8 to 1/4 inch of fabric from the edge before you begin sewing the rolled hem.;
, It is important to use a needle and thread that are appropriate for the type of fabric you are sewing. Rolled edges are popular with delicate projects like scarves and handkerchiefs, so you may want to use a fine needle and fine thread.


Try using a straw needle in size 11 with some delicate thread.Thread the needle by inserting the end of the thread through the eye of the needle.
Tie a couple of knots at the end of the thread to anchor it in place when you begin sewing.

, To secure your thread and hide the knot, insert the needle into the wrong side of the fabric. Push the needle through near the corner of the fabric. After you fold down the fabric and complete your first few stitches, the knot will be hidden.Some sewers do not recommend knotting the thread to secure it out of concern for the fabric. Instead, they recommend allowing the stitches to hold the thread in place.If you are concerned about the knot damaging your fabric, then you can try starting the stitch without a knot. You will just need to take care not to let the end of the thread pull through. After several stitches, your thread should be secured.

, Next, fold over the edge of your fabric by about 1/8 of an inch. There is no need to secure it in place with pins, which may damage delicate fabric. However, it is a good idea to crease the fabric, such as by pressing the edge with an iron.Keep in mind that pressing with an iron is optional. You can also crease the edge with your fingers or use a coin to crease the edge if ironing is not an option.
Be careful when creasing or pressing delicate fabric. You may want to lay a piece of scrap fabric over the fabric and crease or iron through the extra fabric to protect it.

, Your thread should be coming out of the right side of the fabric from securing the knot. Bring the needle up and over the top of the folded edge and then insert the needle near the bottom of the raw edge.The needle does not need to go all the way through the fabric. It is okay if you just catch a few threads., Next, insert the needle near the top edge of the fold.This is the second stitch location for the rolled hem stitch.


After you go through the top, go back through the bottom again. Repeat this pattern about every 1/4 inch (1cm).
Continue to alternate between stitching at the bottom and top of the fold for three to five stitches. These two stitches work together to create the rolled hem.

, After you have completed three to five stitches, you can tug the thread to roll the hem. Gently tug on the thread to tighten the stitches. By tugging on the thread, you will be pulling the two edges together and this is what creates the rolled hem.Tug the thread to tighten the stitches about every three to five stitches.
Continue to stitch and tug until your project is complete.

Spread your fabric on a hard surface, such as a table or gridded cutting board.,
Pick up the lower right edge of fabric and place it flush with the upper edge.,
Bring the top point (on your right side) down so the length of fabric looks like a pirate hat.,
Pick up the top right angled edge, folding the fabric below the top left edge.,
Rotate the fabric counter-clockwise 45 degrees.,
Cut off a strip of fabric 1/4 inch (.635 cm) to eliminate the fold on the right.,Turn the fabric all the way around so the cut edge is now on your left side.,Line your ruler so a ruler marking lines up with the cut edge of fabric.,
Cut the fabric, using the edge of a ruler as a guide.",How to Cut Bias Strips,"

The short edges of the fabric should be oriented to your left and right sides.
You should have one long fabric edge immediately in front of you with the second long fabric edge pointed away from you.;
,

The right edge and top of fabric should form a point as you fold the fabric at a 45 degree angle.

,

The top right corner should meet at the 45 degree corner at the lower-left edge, in the middle.

,

The top right angled edge will be close to, but not on, the lower edge of fabric.

,

After rotating the fabric, the folded edge should be on your right side.

,

If you have folded your fabric correctly, this cut sliver should come off in 1 long piece.

,,,

As you cut off strips, line the new left edge of fabric with the mark you chose on the ruler.
Using the same marking on your ruler ensures your strips of fabric are all the same width.

Consider leaving a raw edge.,
Create a simple straight stitch hem.,
Try a zig zag hem.,
Do a rolled hem.,
Go with a lettuce hem.",How to Hem Knit Fabrics1," You may be able to skip hemming altogether in some cases. However, keep in mind that this does not work for all knit fabrics, and some people simply dislike the look of an unhemmed garment. For example, if you are making a jersey knit dress or skirt, then you can often get away with skipping the hem.To see if your fabric will hold up against a hem-free finish, try gently stretching the raw edge of the fabric to see if it frays or unravels when you do so. If it does, then skipping the hem may not be a great idea for your fabric. If it holds up, then you can probably skip the hem.;
, The straight stitch is a common one for hemming fabrics. If you just want a simple, non-decorative stitch, then this is perfect. Set your machine to the straight stitch setting and sew along the folded hem about ¼” (0.6 cm) from the raw edge., The zig zag stitch is a functional and decorative stitch that can add some flair to your knit fabric hem. If you want the hem to be a little interesting looking, then try using the zig zag setting on your sewing machine when you sew the hem.Sew the hem about ¼” (0.6 cm) from the raw edge of the folded fabric.

, A rolled hem is also popular for hemming knits and other delicate fabrics. To do a rolled hem, you will need to use a serger. Your serger should have a rolled hem setting that you can switch on and then sew along the raw edge of your knit fabric to create the rolled hem.If you do not have a serger, then you can also try sewing a rolled hem by hand. However, keep in mind that this can take a long time if the hem is long.

, You can also try a lettuce hem, which is a variation of the rolled hem. The lettuce hem is a ruffled hem along the raw edge of the fabric and it looks nice as a hem for skirts and other items that you want to have a frilly finish. You can do a lettuce hem the same way you do a rolled hem, but you will need to stretch the fabric slightly as you sew.Gently stretch the edges of the fabric as you sew. Do not stretch to the point of extreme tension, just stretch the fabric slightly to create the ruffling effect.
You will need a serger to do a lettuce hem as well.

"
"
Use a universal needle.,
Go with a ballpoint needle.,
Try a double needle.",How to Hem Knit Fabrics2," You can use a universal needle to sew a hem for a knit fabric. Universal needles are designed to work well with a variety of different fabrics, including knits. Most sewing machines come with these needles already installed. If you don’t want to bother with a special needle, then just use a universal needle.You can use any stitch with a universal needle.

, Like ballpoint pins, a ballpoint needle goes in between knit stitches rather than through them. This type of needle is perfect for sewing knit fabrics and it will help to prevent holes in the fabric.You can use this needle with the same types of stitches you would use with the universal needle.

, Double, or twin, needles are just what they sound like. These are needles that have two sharp ends instead of one. They move in tandem to sew a double seam along the edges of fabrics. If you want to create a double seam for your knit project, then you might consider using a double needle.Use the straight stitch setting with a double needle.

"
"
Press the hem first.,
Use interfacing.,
Use ballpoint pins to hold the hem in place while you sew.,
Hold the fabric without stretching it.",How to Hem Knit Fabrics3," Taking a few minutes to iron the hem flat before you sew can help to improve the look of your finished project and make sewing the hem easier. Fold over your hem fabric and iron it flat.You may also consider pressing your hem after you finish sewing it. This can be especially helpful if you accidentally stretch out a portion of the fabric and want to shrink it slightly.

, Interfacing is not required for hemming knit fabrics, but it can help to create a more structured hem. It can also help to ensure that your hem is straight by providing a guide for you to sew over.To use interfacing, get some interfacing tape in the size of your choice. For example, if you want a ½” (1.3 cm) hem, then you could get ½” (1.3 cm) interfacing tape.
Then, cut he interfacing to the length needed for your hem and lay it down on the wrong side of the fabric so that it is about ¼” (0.6 cm) from the raw edge.
Fold the fabric and interfacing tape over.
Sew just along the edge of the interfacing tape to create the hem.

, Pins are essential for most sewing projects, and sewing with jersey is no exception. However, regular pins may poke holes in your fabric. To avoid this, you can use ballpoint pins. Pin your hem to hold it in place and to keep the edges even as you sew.Ballpoint pins have rounded tips instead of the pointed tips that regular pins have, so they go in between the stitches of knits rather than poking holes in them.

, As you sew your hem, be careful not to stretch it. Stretching the fabric may result in puckering or an uneven hem. Keep the fabric straight, but do not pull on it as you sew.To avoid unintentional pulling, hold the fabric in your lap or place it on the table as you sew. Do not allow it to hang off the table and touch the floor because this will cause the fabric to stretch.

Decide your method of cutting.,
Purchase only a good pair of 8"" fabric shears if you are either just starting out or on a budget.",How to Decide Between Scissors and Rotary Cutter,"


""Scissors"" refers to the cutting tool in which both handles are the same size. ""Shears"" have two sizes of handle holes -- one hole is bigger to accommodate multiple fingers. (In this article, we use the two terms interchangeably, as do most people.) Scissors are versatile: you can use scissors to cut out garment sewing patterns, to trim excess fabric from seam allowances, and to snip loose threads. They make easy work of cutting curves, and since the human body has curves, most clothing patterns include them. Use scissors to ""quick mark"" darts and notches in sewing patterns. Scissors cut through threads as well as fabric, so they're handy to keep by your sewing machine. It does take some skill to use a scissors well, but it’s not that hard to master. Scissors can be used anywhere, including while holding a piece on your lap. 8"" shears is the most common choice for most sewing tasks, because they create long stable cuts and fit adult hands. Left-handed scissors are available, and worth the investment for lefties.
Rotary cutters can be quick and easy. Long straight lines are suited for rotary cutters, such as quilting strips, pillows, curtains, long straight hems and side seams in garments. It can be easier to cut many layers of fabric with a rotary cutter. Some sewers who have issues with arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome experience less discomfort when using. Beginners may find a rotary cutter fast to use (although experienced sewers cut equally fast with a scissors). You must plan ahead to use a rotary cutter, and you can't cut just anywhere. You must have 1. Rotary cutter, 2. Cutting mat, 3. Replacement blades and 4. Ruler. The cutting mat is placed under the fabric to avoid damaging your flooring or table. The original blades will eventually become dull and can't be sharpened, so budget for replacement blades. Most people also use a ruler when using a rotary cutter, so as you can see, some investment is required for a rotary cutter ""system."" Finally, it's easy to go past your mark with rotary cutters; although this can also happen with scissors, it's less likely.;
, You don't need the most expensive pair, but do stay away from the cheapest model. Fiskars, Mundial and Gingher are good brands that range from $17 to $40. Fabric scissors or shears are an investment; you will come to love them, and they will give you many years of use. You might wait to determine what kinds of sewing you prefer before purchasing a rotary cutter, cutting mat, replacement blades and ruler.

Pick your scissors.,Lay the fake fur on a flat surface with the fur down and the backing up,
Have the scissors opened slightly, and slide the tip of the scissors into the fur so that you will only cut the backing, and not the fur itself.,
Pin it first.,
Push the fur away from the edges you will be sewing, and pin it so that the fur is kept away from the seam.,
Keep the pins in until you are about to sew that section of fur.",How to Cut and Sew Fake Fur," Unlike most fabrics, you don't want large scissors. Instead use small, thin scissors. Embroidery scissors are great, but toenail scissors should work fine as well.
,, This is why you need thin scissors. If you do this correctly, you will get almost no fluff floating around., Use berry pins or glass headed pins, not ordinary pins, so they won't get lost in the fur., Use lots of pins, about 5cm (2 inches) is a good distance between pins - too far between, and the fur is likely to be caught in the seam., If you are using a sewing machine, the tip of the pin should almost touch the machine's foot before you remove the pin. But make sure you don't actually sew the pin."

Hang and enjoy your new art piece.",How to Restore and Use an Old Picture Frame," Find an art piece or photograph that needs to be framed and displayed. Set it up and study it for a few minutes, asking yourself these questions: What is the all over mood of the piece? What type of frame do you visualize being ideal? What colors predominate? What style or period does it reflect? What space will it fill? In what room will it be hanging? Does it have to coordinate with other frames? Or complement other furniture pieces?
, Check the back of the frame to see if it will come apart. Many are glued and the pieces impossible to separate. If there is paper over the back, carefully lift a corner and look underneath to see if there are staples or nails that can be removed. Beware of plastic imitating wood, it can look wonderful, but be impossible to work with. There are so many wood frames to pick from so go with the real thing., You will need to have plenty of room to set the parts of the frame out, since each will be approximately the same size as the frame. If you need to transform the work space back to how you found it, for example, a kitchen or dining room, you'll want to be extra organized so you can accomplish the entire restoration in one work session. Make an area covered with a soft towel and away from the work space for the glass piece to reside and dry after you clean it, A pair of needle nose pliers, a hammer, screw drivers, a ruler/yardstick, pencil, small container to hold clips, nails, etc., hammer, a drill, framing hardware such as metal hangers, picture wire, glass cleaning solution, an Exacto or sharp craft knife, sandpaper, cloth rags and paper towels., Turn it over on a protective surface. No need to distress the frame's front more than it is already, so use cardboard and/or a cloth padding covering for the work table. Depending on its age and where it has been stored, removing the nails or staples from the back might require a little elbow grease. Needle nose pliers usually work well for this job. Save all things you remove in a small container, some can be reused, but keeping a neat work area is important., Remove and set aside the backing, the filling or padding, the photo or picture, and the glass. Keep everything because you might be able to reuse the backing and most often the glass is salvageable., Turn the frame over and examine it. Use a slightly dampened rag to wipe away grime and dust. Take a stiff bristle paint brush and go over the surface of the frame, especially if there is carving or ornate portions. Wipe it down and decide how much you want to alter it. Will you simply restore the wood or need to take drastic measures and paint it., This is the time for creative thinking. Small shapes of soft wood can be purchased at the craft store and adapted, so think outside the box. Depending upon how much needs replacing, it might be better to remove small bits or to add on pieces and redesign the surface. Investigate whether commercial wood filler might work as a medium for molding and restoring small ornaments. Wood glue, such as Elmer's can be mixed with wood shavings or sawdust to make a filler., If they are deep, fill them with wood filler or purchase a kit of wax sticks in various colors designed for fixing furniture to smooth out scratches. Paste shoe polish works well and is cheap, easy to obtain, and comes in many colors. Magic markers in a matching color can sometimes be used to color and fill scratches. Acrylic paint can be mixed to the exact shade needed and applied to wood frames. Nicks on edges can be sandpapered down and smoothed out. If the frame is in really bad shape, consider distressing or aging the piece for a trendy finish., If you use spray paint, do it in outdoors or in a well ventilated garage or other space. Protect surfaces from the over spray. Be sure the surface of your frame is clean, dry and in drastic cases, light sandpapering might be in order. Never do a heavy one coat spraying. Always do very light handed spraying, let it dry and respray as many times as you need to. The last thing you want is drips and running paint to mar the frame's beauty., Once the base coat is down, mix a darker shade of acrylic paint and accent low areas, adding to and enhancing the shadow areas. A product called Rub and Buff can sometimes work miracles., Perhaps a pair of rubber gloves would be useful to protect your hands. If the glass is damaged or chipped, replace it with new window weight glass or lightweight plexiglass. Take the empty frame with you when having glass cut as old frames are not always what they seem when it comes to measurements. Letting the glass cutter have the frame will save frustration and return trips to the store when cut glass doesn't fit properly., Watercolors are meant to be shown behind shiny, not non reflective glass. Oil and acrylic paintings require no glass, but their surface ought to be sealed with transparent acrylic sealer., Each frame will require its own special method for attaching the glass. Glazier's or framer's points work well in most cases. A point pusher tool is invaluable. Work on a protected surface and away from yourself. An electric staple gun is a great tool, but worth buying only if you plan to use it a lot. It uses heavy duty staples and makes stapling a breeze. Thin, framer's nails are the most common way to attach the glass. A tool especially designed for pushing nails is a big asset, but only works on flat frames. Original nails ought to be disposed of in a thoughtful manner, not tossed randomly into the trash. Staples on frame backs are designed to be bent a number of times and will go back to shape. When they stop doing the job, pull them out and replace them with nails., If you are framing an oil or acrylic painting, there are clips to attach the stretched canvas to the frame. If it is a canvas board, simply follow the procedure for securing with nails or points. No glass is required, though., Before completely securing the glass, turn the piece over and give it a hard look to remove any imperfections or make adjustments. Check for trapped lint, hairs, places that need erasing on the mat, uneven places or shifting, your signature if it is your art work, etc. Don't skip this as it is far easier to discover problems early than to undo an entirely nailed back., Definitely, use a ruler to measure down from the top edge of the frame. Go down about 1/3 of the way and mark where you will be screwing the clip or eyelet that holds the wire. Use magic marker if pencil marks are too faint. Don't guess at this. Use the drill first or an awl to punch the first holes for the screws. This will avoid splitting the narrow wood. If more than one screw is needed in the hardware, use matching ones, don't mix standard and Phillips on the same frame. Just be consistent and neat. If you don't have a dedicated punch, simply use a slightly larger nail, tap gently and remove to make the pilot holes. Metal eyelets work well in many smaller frames., Don't plan for much slack in the wire. It should never show above the picture at the top when hanging. Do allow a lot of extra picture wire to loop through the eyelets on each side. Guide it through an eyelet, double back and twist. Twist again and twist any excess wire along the hanging surface of the wire. Keep it neat looking. Fold over and tape the ragged ends for safety., If you desire, cut a piece of brown craft paper larger than the back, cutting small notches where the wire attaches to the frame. Run a tiny bead of white glue all around the frame's edges. Go underneath the wire and place the paper lightly against the wood of the frame. Press paper down against the glue. When dry, cut remove excess, overhanging paper by cutting along the frame's outer edge with a craft knife or scissors. Lightly mist the paper with plain water and a spray bottle. Let it dry and it will shrink to tightly fit the back and cover all the hardware and nails for a professional look., This hobby is addictive so you will probably find yourself planning the next project. You will gain a new appreciation of the beauty and resilience of the lovingly chosen wood for these old frames. At the thrift shop, you won't blithely pass by the frames waiting to be taken home and restored. Their uniqueness, impossible to find in standard commercial frames, will call to you and with little effort you will have restored a little piece of history."

Pour some of the paint onto a palette (you can use a plastic plate, but a glass one is recommended because it is easier to clean.),
Take a paintbrush and paint the picture you want.",How to Use Art Supplies1," Watercolor paints are painted on watercolor paper and then wet with water and a brush. Oil paints are painted on canvas or linen. Acrylic, tempera, and gouache paints are good for beginners because they are easy to move on the paper and dry quickly.;
, It's better to mix colours than use paint directly out of the container, especially if you don't have access to many colours. If you are unsure how to mix colours and what will be the result, use a color wheel for help. They come in a variety of sizes and are a very useful tool.

, If painting from a photograph, it should be your own photo or you will need to get permission from the photographer before using his/her work. Either use a new paint brush or dip it in water when you want to use a new color. Keep in mind that there are many kinds of paintbrushes, and not all brushes are created equal.

It is recommended that you use an ink bottle and wooden pen with metallic point instead of normal ball-point pen because sometimes in order to get thicker lines you might want to use a brush dipped in ink instead of a pen.

, There are several methods of doing that. The easiest one is getting gray shades is mixing the ink with water. However, it is recommended that you make different shades of gray using dots. Just plot random dots where you are going to begin shading (depends on virtual point of light, or sun). Dots should be little far apart so you get lighter gray. As you move towards the darker side, decrease the distance between the dots until you get a solid black color. You can also dip the brush in ink and shade darkest sides with it.

It is recommended that you use hard pastels first. Save the soft pastels for the finishing touches. Like icing on a cake. Because of the tooth of Wallis paper and other papers like it, using the hard pastels first will be beneficial and will keep you from using up your expensive soft pastels too quickly.
The more pastel you put in an area...the darker it will be.

Make sure your name is easy to pronounce.,
Decide if you want your project to carry a brand, e.g.,
Check your proposed name in a search engine.,
Check domain name availability.",How to Name a Project," Shorter names more often result in memorable and brandable names. Long and convoluted names are hard to remember and easily overlooked.;
, Don't name your project after a pre-existing entity. If you're pulling names from Greek mythology, Christian references, or a family of animals, it has most likely been done before and it will be difficult to turn it into something fresh and original.


One exception to this is if you're going to append an identifier to your name. For example, the name ""Zeus"" is too generic and overused on its own, but if you are developing a new instant messenger, the name ""ZeusIM"" could work well.

, Projects like YouTube, Facebook, and Myspace prove that using generic words in new ways can result in a very recognizable brand.

, The names ""Zxthx"" or ""Sivbrev"" might look interesting and unique, but if your project name can't be said easily and effortlessly in the middle of conversation, people won't talk about it very often.

, Google, or if you want your project to describe its purpose, e.g. Lifehacker. Nobody knew what ""google"" meant when Google first started; they only got to where they are now through careful brand building. On the other hand, descriptive names can immediately let your audience know what your project is about without having to build a brand beforehand.

, Running your proposed name as a search query can show you whether or not there are other projects with the same or similar names. If you receive a lot of search results with that name, that means you'll have more competition for that name.

, This step is especially important if you plan on having a web presence for your project. If you've decided on naming your project ""Tomato Chat,"" you should look to see if tomatochat.com or tomatochat.net are available. If they aren't available, you may want to reconsider your name.

Thread the tail through a needle.,
Weave the end through the loops of the stitches.,
Add a dab of stitch sealant.",How to Finish Serger Thread Tails1," One easy way to finish your serger thread tails is to weave it back through the stitches. This will result in a double stitch look on one small portion of your serged stitches, but it will keep the stitches out of the way. Start by threading the serger tail through the eye of a needle.You may want to use a large eye needle to make threading the tail through the eye a bit easier.;
, After you have threaded the needle, insert the needle into the area between the stitches and the fabric. Do not insert the needle into the fabric. Keep pushing the needle through until the serge tail slides off the eye of the needle.When you are finished pushing the needle through, the tail should be laying flat underneath the stitches.
Remove the needle from under the stitches after the tail slides off the eye.

, To ensure that the tail will stay put and will not fray, you may also want to use a dab of stitch sealant, such as Fray Check. Add a small dab to the end of the serger tail to prevent the tail from unraveling.If you do not have stitch sealant, then a dab of clear drying fabric glue will also work.

Use a pin or needle to unravel the tail strings.,
Tie the two long ends to the two short ends.,
Cut the excess.",How to Finish Serger Thread Tails2," Another easy way to finish serger thread tails is to unravel the tail and tie the ends of the thread together. Use a pin or needle to unravel the serger tail, starting near the end of the tail and working downwards as you unravel the thread.Think of the tail like a braid. You need to start at the bottom of the braid to undo it. Starting too far up may result in knots and pulling.
Keep unraveling until you have reached the edge of the fabric and the tail is divided into four separate threads.

, Once you have unraveled the tail, divide the threads according to length. You should have two short ends and two long ends. Pair the ends according to length and then tie them together.Tie the two short ends to the two long ends.
Double knot the ends for extra security.

, After you have secured the ends into a knot, cut off the excess thread. Don’t cut too close to the knot or the knot may come undone.If desired, you can also add a dab of stitch sealant or fabric glue to the knot to make it more secure.

Fold the tail over the edge of the garment.,
Serge over the tail.,
Clip the excess thread.",How to Finish Serger Thread Tails3," Another way to secure the tail and prevent it from unraveling is to stitch over it with your serger. To do this, fold the tail over the edge of the fabric so that it is aligned with the other stitches.You can fold the tail right over top of the other stitches.
You can also fold the tail onto the backside of the garment to make it less visible.

, Next, place your fabric under your serger needle and serge over the tail to secure it. Stitch to the end of the tail. You only need to go over the tail once., After you reach the end of the tail, remove the fabric from the serger and snip off the excess thread from this new stitch.If desired, you can also add a dab of stitch sealant or fabric glue to the end of the tail and new stitch to help prevent fraying.

, This will be the same size as your Rune, so make sure you're happy with the size before proceeding.

, With a small, sharp knife, cut thin and shallow lines around the picture. Do not cut all the way through just yet. Be as precise as possible and cut close to the picture.

, Get the outer lines, the insides of the curves, and inside the diamond. It won't be perfect at first, so cut away all the loose outer edges. Take note that the back of the rune is supposed to be left flat for stability. Smooth over the Rune once you're done cutting- you can use a little water to seal cracks shut.

, Make sure that the hole is big enough for a chain or string of your choice to fit through. Alternatively, you can purchase a jewelry kit and use the items in it.

Create your desired image.,
Get a wooden block.,
Place your image down onto the wood.,
Draw over the image with a pen.,
Cut your woodblock.,
Gather your paper, ink, and roller.,
Roll the ink over your woodcut.,
Lay your paper over the inked woodcut.,
Smooth over the paper.,
Lift away the paper.",How to Make Art Prints1," Take a sheet of plain white paper and draw the picture that you'd like to print.


Be sure to use a standard lead pencil so the lead can transfer off and provide an outline for your wood cutting.;
, This should be soft wood, like a thin birch or pine plywood. Use whatever size you'd like your print to end up being.


If it's your first time, you might want to use a smaller piece of wood, just to get used to the process.

, Set the lead side of your drawing directly onto the wood. Carefully rub across the image so that the lead transfers to the wood. Remove the paper drawing.

, Depending on the kind of wood you used, it may be difficult to see the penciled image. Go over the image with a pen, so you can easily cut around it.

, Make sure your wood is on a non-slip surface and gather several different sizes of wood gouges. Cut and carve away the wood surrounding your image, taking care not to cut into the image itself. Use gouges to make shallow cuts away from yourself.


A V-shaped gouge cuts against the grain, while a U-shaped gouge cuts along the grain, making it easier to remove large chunks. You can purchase several sizes of wood gouges, controlling the level of detail.

, You may want to do a few practice prints on scrap paper before using your chosen paper. Load your rubber roller with ink, by rolling it in the ink until evenly distributed.

, Make sure to completely cover your block so that the image is covered in ink. The only part of the woodblock without ink should be the part that you cut away.

, Be sure to carefully position the piece of paper over the block so that it lines up straight.

, Start from the center of the paper and gently, but firmly press the paper smoothly across the block. You can use a letter opener, wooden spoon, or bone folder to apply even pressure.

, Slowly pull up on the edges of the paper to remove it from your woodcut. You should see your image printed on the paper. Let your print dry completely before framing or hanging it.

Create your desired image.,
Ink your plexiglass plate.,
Wipe excess ink off your plate.,
Prepare your paper.,
Position your plexiglass etching on your press.,
Run your print through the press.,
Let the image dry.",How to Make Art Prints2," Take a piece of clear plexiglass and an etching needle. Etch your design directly onto the glass, creating grooves in the plexiglass where the paint will be deposited.

, Once your image is complete, gather your paints, cotton balls, or felt. Use the cotton balls or felt to dip into your paint. Lightly press it against the image.


You can press one color at a time, or apply multiple colors for a single pressing. Either way will give you slightly different results, so feel free to play around.

, Take a rag and carefully wipe across the plate, making sure excess ink from the surface of the plate is removed. You should only have ink in the grooves of your image.

, Use watercolor paper and soak the papers in water for several minutes. Remove them from the water, lay them on towels, and gently blot them dry.


Soaking and blotting your papers will make the fibers swell. This makes it easier to transfer your etched painting onto the paper.

, You'll need to use a print-making press in order to exert enough pressure. Set the prepared paper on top of your inked plexiglass etching and cover with a towel.

, Using medium strength, press your image onto the paper. Carefully remove the towel and lift up on the the paper to release it from the plexiglass etching. Your image should have transferred.

, Make sure the paint is completely dry before framing or hanging your print. Sign and number it before printing more.

Trace and cut out handprints.,
Paint the handprints.,
Attach handprints to straws.,
Put the hand print flowers in a flower pot.",How to Make Handprint Flowers1," Trace your hand with a pencil on plain white paper. Cut the handprint out with scissors. You can also wait until you’ve painted the handprints to cut them out. Repeat this until you have about 10-12 handprints.10-12 handprints is a good amount, but you can cut out as many as you’d like.;
, Acrylic paint, or any type of paint that is made for kids, will work. Choose 3 or 4 colors. Purple, pink, red, and yellow work well together. Use a paintbrush to paint each handprint that you cut out.Keep a cup of water beside you to wash the paintbrush as you switch colors.

, Once the paint has dried, use glue or cellotape to attach the handprints to straws. Any type of plastic or paper straws will work. Cut the bottom of the straws to vary the lengths so that they look better once arranged in the flower pot.You can use regular Elmer’s white glue to attach the handprints to straws.

, You can use any flower pot. Arrange the handprint flowers in the flower pot. Place some Play-Doh or Blue-Tac at the bottom of the straws to weigh the flowers down in the pot. Fill the pot about halfway with strips of tissue paper once you are satisfied with the flower arrangement.You can add or take away handprints until you are satisfied with the outcome.

Trace your hand.,
Trace the hand on tissue paper.,
Arrange the tissue paper.,
Roll the paper around floral wire.,
Secure the wire.,
Repeat the process.",How to Make Handprint Flowers2," Trace your or your child’s hand on a piece of plain white paper. Cut the hand out to use as a template. This cut out will not be used in the final project., Place the template on about 25 sheets of tissue paper. You can use one color of tissue or paper or many colors. Because tissue paper is very thin, you should be able to cut out most or all 25 handprints at once. Each handprint flower will use about 15 pieces of tissue paper, so you will need to cut more out later.Use regular scissors to cut out all pieces of tissue paper at once. Dull scissors made for children may not do the job.

, Separate the pieces of tissue paper. Lay about 15 pieces of the cut out handprints on top of each other. The arrangement does not matter because you’re going to roll the tissue paper around floral wire., Take a piece of floral wire and bend it in half. Place the folded piece of wire at the bottom of the tissue paper handprints. Use your fingers to roll the bottom of the handprint around the floral wire as if you were trying to wrap the wire. The fingers should be loose in order to resemble petals., Use floral tape to secure the tissue paper to the wire. Wrap the floral tape around the tissue paper as far down on the paper as possible. It’s okay if it doesn’t look very pretty. The tape won’t show once the flowers are put in a vase., Continue to cut out paper, wrap it around floral wire, and secure the flower with tape. Repeat this process until you have as many flowers as desired. You can use more or less tissue paper for each flower to make some flowers fuller or thinner than others. Put the flowers in a vase when you’re finished."
"
Trace your hand.,
Draw and cut out a stem.,
Glue everything to white paper.",How to Make Handprint Flowers3," These flowers are a great idea for children to make on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Begin by tracing your or your child’s hand with a pencil on a piece of light pink paper. Cut it out and then repeat the process on a piece of light and dark brown paper. You should end up with three handprints., Using a pencil, draw a stem on a piece of green paper. Make the stem big enough so that it looks like it could support the size of the handprints. Draw a few leaves branching off of the stem. Cut it out when you are finished drawing., Use a glue stick or white Elmer’s glue on the back of the stem. Glue the stem to a piece of white paper. Then, glue each of the handprints at the very top of the stem. The handprints should slightly overlap each other. The order of the handprints doesn’t matter."

Cut a length of ribbon.,
Make two loops in your ribbon.,
Cross the loops over and under each other.,
Gently adjust the length of the tails and the loops.,
Straighten the knot, if needed.,
Shape the ribbons and trim the tails.",How to Make a Bow with Wired Ribbon1," How long the ribbon is depends on how big you want the bow to be. The wider the ribbon is, the more ribbon you will need to cut. This method will create something that looks like the standard bow you'd use to tie shoe laces with., Find the center of your length of ribbon first, then make a loop to each side of that point. Make sure that both loops are pointing upward., Gently tug on the loops to tighten the knot. This is just like when you are tying your shoes., Pull the loops or tails one at a time until you get the length you want them to be. Stop when the loops are the right length for you, then tug on them both at the same time to tighten the knot. Don't worry if the tails are too long., If you have a very wide ribbon, the knot in the middle may be wrinkled. Slip your forefingers under each side of the knot on the front of the ribbon. Straighten out the side edges of the knot., Use your fingers to fluff up the loops to you liking. The wires inside the ribbons will help the loops keep their shape. If you need to, use a pair of scissors to trim the ribbon tails down.You can cut the tail ends at angles or into notches.

Add sugar to water.,
Heat the sugar and water.,
Cool the nectar.,
Hang a jar dispenser.,
Try a plate dispenser.,
Start simple with a sponge feeders.,
Make the food accessible to butterflies.,
Fill the dispenser with food.,
Decorate the feeder.,
Place the feeder outside where butterflies can reach it.,
Maintain the feeder.",How to Make a Butterfly Feeder," Put 1 cup (0.24 L) of sugar in a pan or pot. Add 0.25 cups (0.059 L) of sugar to the water. If you want to make more or less nectar, adjust both ingredients to keep a 4:1 ratio.For example, if you wanted to make 2 cups (0.47 L) of nectar, you would add 0.50 cups (0.12 L) of sugar.
As an alternative to a sugar water nectar, you can use ripened/rotting fruit.;
, The sugar will not dissolve into the water easily at room temperature. You can increase the solubility by heating the mixture. Place the pot or pan on the stove and heat until you no longer see sugar particles floating in the water., Hot nectar could hurt the butterflies. Allow the nectar to sit out until it cools to room temperature. If you need to cool the nectar faster, place it in the refrigerator or freezer, but do not freeze it.If you are using fruit instead of sugar water nectar, you can place bananas in the freezer. They will turn black and the fruit inside will be mushy when it thaws. Butterflies love this!

, Jar dispensers are often more visually appealing, but are slightly more difficult to hang. You first tie a string around the mouth of the jar, and then tie both ends of another string to the first to make a loop over the bottom of the jar. Tie a second loop in the same way, and then use a final string to tie the top of the loops together. This will allow you to hang the dispenser in a neat and balanced way., These are easier to hang, but might take more work to look good. Use a plastic lid (like you would find on a tub of whipped cream topping). Make a hole through the lip of the lid on either side and loop a separate piece of string through each hole. Use the loop to hang the plate., Sponge feeders are the simplest design, but they hold less nectar than jars or plates. You simply let a sponge soak up some nectar and then set it on a fence, tree branch, or other elevated surface near the garden. If you want to hang the sponge feeder, just tie a string around the sponge and hang it., Once you have built and hung a dispenser, you’ll need to make it easy for the butterflies to reach the nectar. Sponge feeders require no further action to do this. Plate feeders can benefit from having a sponge, cotton ball, or other soft, absorbent material placed in the nectar. This allows the butterfly to land and feed. Jar feeders are slightly more involved:Use a hammer and nail to punch a hole in the lid of the jar (take the lid off to do this).
Tightly plug the hole with a sponge, cotton ball, or other similarly absorbent material to keep the nectar from pouring out of the hole.

, For sponge feeders, simply dip a sponge in the nectar. Fill plate feeders by pouring nectar in after hanging them. Fill jar feeders by pouring nectar in and then securing the lid (with the hole plugged) before allowing the jar to hang upside down., Butterflies are attracted to bright colors and flowers. You can pick bright colored flowers to put on the feeder and color the strings and dispenser with bright paint or markers. For a more permanent feeder, use fake flowers so that they do not wilt., In a garden or around a patch of bright flowers will attract the most butterflies. Spring and summer are the best times to place your feeder. Keep the feeder away from your house or deck. It may attract other bugs, too., Replace the nectar as needed in the feeder. You can store excess nectar in your fridge for up to one week and use it as needed. If insects or other contaminants get trapped in the feeder, clean it out when replacing the nectar."

Roll the end of your ribbon into a small loop.,
Twist the ribbon and make another loop.,
Twist the ribbon again and make another loop.,
Continue working back and forth, making loops.,
Wrap a wire around the middle of the bow.,
Consider adding some ribbon tails.",How to Make a Bow with Wired Ribbon2," Turn the ribbon so that the wrong side is facing you. Roll the end of the ribbon onto itself to form a tube. Hold the tube in place with your thumb and forefinger. This will make the center loop of your ribbon.Keep your thumb inside the tube, and your forefinger behind the overlapping ribbon.
This method will make a looped bow, like the kind used on floral arrangements and wreaths.

, Give the ribbon a small twist so that the right side is showing. Pull it under the tubed ribbon to form a small loop. Slip it under your forefinger to hold it in place., Give the ribbon a twist so that the right side is visible again. Make another loop on the other side of the central loop. Make sure that it is the same side as you second loop., Give the ribbon a twist each time so that the right side is always visible. Make the loops a little bigger on each row. You can have as many rows/loops as you want., Thread a piece of thin wire through the first central loop that you made. Wrap it under the bow and back through that first loop. Tug on it to tighten it, then wrap it a few more times. Twist the wire shut, then trim off any excess.The thin wire that florists use will work the best here. You could also use a pipe cleaner that matches your ribbon's color.

, These types of bows usually don't have tails, but you can add some if you want to. Cut off a piece of ribbon that is twice the length you want the tails to be. Fold it in half, then secure it to the back of your bow with more wire.Give the ribbon tails a nicer touch by cutting them at angles or into notches.

Place the end of a ribbon on the center of a book's cover.,
Wrap the ribbon 5 to 9 times around the book.,
Trim off the excess ribbon, just past the mid-point of the cover.,
Slide the wrapped bundle off of the book.,
Wrap a thin wire around the middle of your bundle.,
Cut ribbon for the tails of your bow.,
Tie a loose knot in the middle of the tail ribbon.,
Wrap the tail ribbon around the middle of the bow.,
Use the excess wire to tie the tail ribbons in place.,
Fluff and shape the ribbon.",How to Make a Bow with Wired Ribbon3," Choose a book that is the same width as the bow you want to make. Place the end of a wide, wired ribbon on the middle of the book's cove.Move the end of the ribbon towards the spine by about ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters).


You can also use a CD or DVD case, or even a scrap of cardboard.

, Keep the ribbon in the same place as you wrap it around the book. This will make your bow look neater in the end. Avoid wrapping the ribbon too tightly, or it will be difficult to slide the bundle off in a later step., You want both ends of the ribbon to be overlapping by ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters). This will help prevent the ribbon from falling apart when you go to tie it together., Try to keep the loops in place so that they are nice and even. Do not lose the middle of your bundle where the ends overlap., Pinch the middle of your bundle first, then wrap a piece of thin wire around the middle. Wrap it tightly so that it creases the ribbon and holds everything together. Don't trim off the excess wire yet.The thin wire that florists use would work great for this. Another option would be one of those twist ties used on trash bags.

, The ribbon needs to be two and a half times the length you want the ribbons to be. For example, if you want the tails to be 12 inches (30.48 centimeters) long, you want to cut 30 inches (76.2 centimeters) of ribbon., Make sure that the knot is loose so that it doesn't wrinkle on the front part. It's okay if it wrinkles on the back where the ribbons cross over one another.

, Place the knotted part of the tail ribbon over the center of your bow. Make sure that the smooth part of the knot is facing out, not the crossed part. Wrap the tail ends over to the back of your bow., Hold the tails of the ribbon behind your bow. Pinch them tightly, then wrap the excess wire around them to keep them in place.Trim off any excess wire.

, Move the loops around to your liking. Use your fingers to make them appear fuller. If the tails of the ribbon are too long, you can trim them down using a sharp pair of scissors.


Cut the ends of the ribbon into notches or angles for a nicer touch.

Cut your ribbon to the desired length and pull out one of the wires.,
Knot one end of the other wire that's still inside the ribbon.,
Gather the ribbon on the wire.,
Curl the ribbon into a spiral.,
Poke the wire down through the middle of the flower.,
Thread the wire through the bottom edge of the flower.,
Tie the wire, if needed, then cut it.",How to Make a Bow with Wired Ribbon4," Cut the ribbon first, then scrunch down one of the ends until a wire pops out. Grab the wire and pull it out. Leave the other wire inside the ribbon.Discard the wire you pulled out or save it for another project.
For 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) wide ribbon, plan on using 1 yard (91.44 centimeters) of ribbon. If your ribbon is thinner, you could try using less.

, Scrunch down one of the ends of the ribbon until the wire pops out. Gently tug out the wire, then tie it into a looped knot. This will help prevent the ribbon from sliding off in the next step., Go to the other end of the ribbon. Scrunch it down until the wire pops out. Grab the wire, and gather the ribbon down it, towards the knotted end. Keep gathering the ribbon until it is all scrunched down above the knotted end., Starting from the end with the long piece of wire, roll the ribbon into a cone-shaped spiral. The scrunched, wired side of the ribbon will make the bottom/center of the flower. The other side of the ribbon will make the petals., Hold the flower in one hand so that it doesn't unravel. Use your other hand to take the long piece of wire, and push it back down through the center of the flower. This will help hold the flower together and flatten it., Poke the wire through the bottom edge of the flower until it comes out the side. Give it a gentle tug, then thread it back through the flower., If the flower is still loose, tie the long tie to the knotted end of the wire. Cut the wire down using a sharp pair of scissors or wire cutters."

Paint a sturdy, 12-inch (30.48-centimeter) cardboard tube.,
Punch two holes at each end of the tube for the axles with a hole puncher.,
Insert the dowels through the holes.,
Adjust the holes, if needed.,
Hot glue a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wooden spool to the back of each CD.,
Hot glue a button to the front of each CD.,
Wrap some rubber bands around the wheels.,
Cut some straws down to make the stoppers.,
Add the stoppers between the wheels and the cardboard tube.,
Attach the wheels.,
Make a rubber band chain using 3 to 4 rubber bands.,
Loop the chain around the front axle in a slipknot.,
Attach a paper clip to the other end of the rubber band chain.,
Feed the chain through the tube and adjust the length, if necessary.,
Attach the chain to the end of the tube with the paper clip.,
Use the car.",How to Make a Rubber Band Car," Pick a tube that's sturdy, like the kind found in rolls of aluminum foil. Paint it using acrylic or tempera paints, then let it dry.Consider making the tube look like a race car. Add a stripe, lightning bolt, and number!
If you aren't good at painting, you can decorate the tube with duct tape or washi tape instead.;
, Make sure that the holes are level and straight across from each other. If you are having trouble making them even, wrap a rubber band vertically around the tube, then use the long, straight line as a guide. Be sure to take the rubber band off when you are done!Don't poke the holes too close to the ends. About 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from each end would be ideal.

, Slide the 6-inch (15.24-centimeter) dowel through the first set of holes, and the 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) dowel through the back. The shorter dowel will be the front of your car, and the longer dowel will be the back., The dowels should be able to spin freely inside the holes. If they don't, take the dowels out and make the holes a little bigger. When you are done, put the dowels back through the holes., Draw a line of hot glue around the clear, plastic circle at the center of a CD. Quickly press the top of the wooden spool into it. Make sure that it is centered. Repeat this step for the other three CDs.You can use old, scratched up CDs or blank ones.
Hot glue sets up quickly, so work one spool and CD at a time.

, The button needs to be big enough to cover the hole in the middle of the CD. Use a standard 2- or 4-hole button, not a shank button with a loop on the end. The button will cover the hole and keep the wheels in place.If you can't find any buttons, cut circles out of thin cardboard, and use those instead.

, Slide two rubber bands onto your first wheel so that they make an X shape on the front. Repeat this step for the other three wheels. This will give your wheels some traction.The rubber bands should be wrapped tightly around the wheels. You may need to wrap them more than once.

, These will go between the wheels and the cardboard tube. Place the wheels onto the ends of the dowels. Make sure that the cardboard tube is centered, then measure the gap between the spool and the cardboard tube. Cut a straw down to fit those measurements. You will need four pieces total.Your first/front set of straws should be about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long.
Your second/back set of straws should be about 2¼-inch (5.71-centimeter) long.
You can use plastic or paper straws. Consider using a color that matches your car.

, Take the wheels off of the dowels first. Place the short stoppers onto the short dowel, and the long stoppers onto the long dowel. Place the wheels back onto the dowels and test the fit. If the stoppers are too long, take everything off and trim them down again., Once you are happy with the fit, take the wheels off and add a drop of white craft glue into each spool. Place the wheels back onto the axles, and let the glue dry.The wheels should fit snugly onto the axles. If they are too loose, wrap some masking tape around the end of the dowel to thicken it.

, Slide a rubber band halfway through another. Pull the end of the rubber band back through the loop. Tug on it gently to make a slipknot. Repeat this step until your chain is about 3 to 4 rubber bands long. You want the chain to be about the same length as your cardboard tube., Tuck the end of your chain behind the axle so that it sticks out by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Pull the rest of your chain through that loop. Gently tug on it to tighten the slipknot., It does not matter if the chain is hooks around the smaller or larger loop on the paper clip., Drop the paper clip down the tube. Grab it with your fingers, then pull it out the other end. The rubber band chain should be about the same length as the cardboard tube. If it is too long, you will need to take off one of the rubber bands in the chain., Pull the rubber band chain taut and point the paper clip towards the mouth of the cardboard tube. Slide the paper clip onto the end of the tube., Pull the car back until the rubber band is tight. Let it go and watch it go-go-go!"

Coat your Bundt pan or mold in non-stick spray.,
Heat water in a small pot or kettle.,
Combine wreath ingredients in a mixing bowl.,
Transfer the mixture to the mold.,
Wait at least 24 hours for the mixture to dry.,
Remove the wreath from its mold.,
Add a hanger to the wreath.,
Hang your wreath and enjoy.,
Create a winter birdseed wreath with ice.,
Experiment with different molds.,
Make your wreath with suet and peanut butter.",How to Make a Birdseed Wreath," Pass the spray back and forth over the inside of your mold until all surfaces are covered.Alternatively, use shortening to grease the bottom of your mold. Be thorough; all surfaces should have a light layer of shortening.


Failing to do this could result in your wreath sticking in the mold. Frequently, stuck wreaths break or crack during removal.;
, Clean the pot or kettle first with dish soap and warm water. Rinse it carefully to avoid soap contamination, which may make birds sick. Add a half cup (118 ml) of water to the pot or kettle over high heat. When it is lightly boiling, turn off the heat.


If more convenient, you can also heat the water in a microwave safe bowl or dish. Heat the water until it is steaming or near boiling., Add the gelatin, hot water, corn syrup, and flour to the bowl. Stir it with a utensil, like a wooden spoon, until it thickens to paste-like consistency.Add the birdseed to the mixture and continue to stir until the seed is evenly distributed.Using more gelatin should make a sturdier, more resilient wreath. If you have issues with wreaths cracking or breaking, add more gelatin.

, Your seed mixture will likely be clumpy at this point. Use your utensil to push the mixture into a Bundt pan or a similar ring shaped mold. Completely fill the pan with the mixture by pressing it into the pan firmly. The top of the mixture should be flat., Some gelatins may dry in as few as eight hours. You can test the mixture by pressing its surface gently with your finger. If it’s soft, it needs more time to dry. For the best results, you may want to wait 48 hours, when the mixture will be fully hardened.


Your gelatin may be ready in as few as two hours if placed in a refrigerator to harden. When the mixture is hard to the touch, remove it from the fridge., Gently flex the mold by bending it with light pressure from your hands. If the wreath is stuck in the mold, use a sturdy, thin tool, like a knife or spatula, to wedge between the mold and the wreath. Work your way around the mold with the tool to loosen it, then remove the wreath., Tie a length of sturdy ribbon around your wreath in a decorative bow. Loop another length of ribbon around the wreath and fasten the ends in a simple knot so you can hang your wreath on hooks, nails, posts, and so on.


Using a heavy fastener, like rope, may be too rough on your wreath and cause it to break. Prioritize lightweight fasteners, like ribbon and twine., Position your wreath where you frequently see birds in your yard, like around active birdfeeders or nearby a bird bath. Hang your wreath from the branches of trees with bird nests. Then you can sit back with a pair of birdwatching binoculars and enjoy your birdseed wreath., Spread a thick layer of birdseed along the entire bottom of a Bundt pan or mold. Fill the mold with clean water. Put the mold in the freezer until frozen. Remove the ice wreath carefully and hang it. Birds will peck away at the ice to get the seeds., Shaped molds can make many different kinds of decorative birdseed “wreaths.” For molds that may be difficult to hang, use a pencil to push a small hole in the wreath mixture while it's still soft. When it hardens, thread ribbon through the hole for hanging.To prevent unique mold shapes from falling apart too soon, you may want to add a little more gelatin to these.
Though not round like a traditional wreath, holiday molds can make festive decorations.

, Suet is a kind of thick, fatty substance used in cooking.It can be purchased at most grocery stores and general retailers. For this wreath, you’ll need 3 blocks of suet, a half cup (118 ml) of peanut butter, and 9 cups (2.1 L) of birdseed. To prepare a suet peanut butter wreath:


Liquify three blocks of suet over low heat in a large pot. Stir the suet as it heats with a wooden spoon. Do not bring the suet to a boil.
When melted, add the peanut butter to the suet. Continue to stir, and when the mixture is consistent throughout and fully melted, remove it from the heat.
Mix in the birdseed with your spoon. Transfer the suet to a Bundt pan or similar mold that has been coated with non-stick spray. Let the mixture harden overnight in a refrigerator."

Consider your fabric type.,
Determine the ideal needle size for your project.,
Choose a needle that suits your thread.,
Opt for a universal needle if you are not sure.,
Go with a sharp point needle for cotton and linen.,
Choose a ball point needle for stretchy fabrics and knits.,
Choose a wedge point needle for heavy duty fabrics.,
Quilt with a quilting needle.,
Try a topstitching needle for heavy or visible stitching.,
Use an embroidery needles for embroidery.",How to Choose the Right Sewing Machine Needle," Not all needles will work with all types of fabric. Before you choose a needle, think about the fabrics that you will be working with and consider whether the fabric is delicate, stretchy, or heavy duty. These types of fabrics usually require a special type of needle.For example, denim and leather are considered heavy duty fabrics, silk is a delicate fabric, and jersey is a stretchy fabric.;
, Smaller needle sizes work best for working with delicate fabrics, while larger needle sizes work better for heavy duty fabrics, such as denim and leather. This is because needle come in different sizes ranging from small to large. The size is indicated by numbers on the needle’s packaging.There is an American and a European scale for needle sizes, and both numbers should be listed on the needle’s packaging.American sizes go from 8 to 19 and European sizes go from 60 to 120.
A larger number indicates a larger or heavy duty needle while a smaller number indicates a smaller or delicate needle.

, Your thread should not take up more than 40% of the diameter of your needle’s eye, so it is important to think about the type of thread you want to use for your project before choosing a needle.Make sure the needle you choose is suitable for the type of thread you will be using.


For example, if you are using a heavy duty needle, then you can use a heavyweight thread. However, if you are using a small size needle, then a heavyweight thread would not be optimal.

, Sewing machines usually come with universal needles because these are best for everyday sewing. Choose a universal needle for working with knit or woven fabrics, or if you are just doing a simple sewing project that does not use a stretchy, delicate, or heavyweight fabric.The most popular universal needle sizes are 14 American (90 European) and 11 American (75 European), so you can go with one of these if you are not sure what type of needle to get.

, If you are going to be working with a woven fabric like cotton or linen, then a sharp pointed needle is best. This type of needle will help to create even stitches with minimal puckering.You can also use a sharp pointed needle when doing delicate stitching or when working with faux suede.
These needles come in sizes 9 through 18 American, or 65 through 110 European.

, Ball point needles do not pierce the fabric. Instead, their rounded tips push the fibers apart and go in between them. Go with a ball point needle if you are working with an interlocking knit or a coarse knit fabric that might snag easily and create runs in the fabric.You can get ball point needles in sizes 9 through 16 American, or 65 through 100 European.

, Wedge point needles work best with leather, suede, and vinyl fabrics because they create a hole that is self-closing. The shape if this needle is also ideal for heavy duty fabrics because it pierces it more easily than other types of needles.


These come in sizes 11 through 18 American, or 75 through 110 European. Use a smaller size for a lighter, more pliable fabric, and use a larger size for thicker, stiffer fabrics.

, Quilting projects call for their own special type of needle. Look for a quilting needle to make it easier to sew through multiple fabric layers at once. The tips of these needles are tapered for ease of sewing and to reduce the chances of damaging delicate and heirloom fabrics.Quilting needles come in sizes 9 through 12 American, or 65 through 80 European.

, If you want to add a topstitch to a project or if you just need to create a heavier stitch, then a topstitching needle is best. The eye is large enough on these needles that you can even use two strands of thread at once for an extra heavy stitch., There are also special needles meant just for embroidery. If you are planning to embroider something, then you should go with an embroidery needle."

Opt for glass head straight pins for everyday projects.,
Use ballpoint pins for knit and jersey fabrics.,
Go with silk pins for delicate fabrics.,
Use a T-pin for upholstery and for items that require pressing.,
Hold multiple layers together with a quilting pin.,
Use safety pins for checking the fit of a garment on a live model.,
Try fork pins for extra slippery fabrics.",How to Choose and Use Sewing Pins1," Glass (or plastic) straight head pins are the most common kind. These pins are great for everyday sewing projects, so it is useful to have a variety of them on hand.These pins come in many different widths and lengths. Choose thin, short pins for more delicate fabrics and thick, long pins for heavier fabrics and multiple layers.One downside of these pins is that they can damage delicate fabrics. If you decide to use these pins for something delicate, then be sure to use the thinnest size available.;
, If you are working with knit fabrics or jersey, then using ballpoint pins is a great way to protect the fabric. These pins have rounded tips, so they do not pierce the fibers like sharp pins do. Instead, they push the fibers aside, and then the fibers can spring back into place after your remove the pins., Silk pins are fine tipped pins that are meant for delicate fabrics. If you are working with a delicate fabric like silk or satin, then silk pins might be the best choice.Silk pins typically do not have a head on them, but you can find ones that do have a head if you prefer them this way.

, T-pins are completely made of metal. The top of the pin has a bend in it, which gives the T-pin its T-shape. These pins are useful if you need to press your fabric before you sew. There are no rounded balls on the end and nothing that will melt, so you can iron right over them if you need to., If you are working on a quilting project or just something with a lot of layers, then a quilting pin might be the best option. These types of pins are thicker and longer than most other pins, so they can easily hold multiple layers., Safety pins are those that have a closure that will cover up the point of the pin and keep the pin in place. If you need to place a garment on a live model to check the fit, then safety pins can be a good option.You can use safety pins to hold the seams in place and then put the garment onto your model without worrying as much about them getting poked.

, If you are working with an extra slippery fabric, then you might want to invest in some fork pins. These pins have two prongs that will help to keep your fabric from sliding all over the place.Try using fork pins with a satin or silk.

Discard old, dull, or damaged pins.,
Store your pins in separate tins or cushions.,
Pin along the seam allowances.,
Place pins perpendicular to seams.",How to Choose and Use Sewing Pins2," Once a pin gets dull or bent, it will no longer be useful to you. Instead of keeping these pins around, throw them away right away so that they do not clutter your good pins.Check your pins after each sewing project to see if any of them were damaged. If any of your pins are damaged, toss them out.

, To keep you different types and sizes of pins separated, you will need to keep them in separate tins or pin cushions. Invest in a few containers or extra cushions to keep all of your different pins.You can also make your own pin cushion using some scrap fabric. Try making a cactus pincushion for something fun to hold your pins.

, Not all fabrics get damaged when you put pins into them, but some might. To play it safe, insert your pins along the seam allowances, which is the area on the edge of your fabric. This area will be hidden after you sew the seams. By placing your pins here, you will decrease the chances that any holes created by the pins will be visible., Placing pins perpendicular to your seams instead of parallel to them can help to prevent you from poking yourself. Placing the pins perpendicular to the seam will also create straighter lines for sewing and make it easier to remove the pins when you are done.To place pins perpendicular to the seams, line them up so that the point is going in towards the seam, rather than alongside it. Each pin should for a letter “T” shape with the seam.

Determine if you need a serger.,
Choose a thread capability.,
Consider additional features.,
Go shopping.,
Ask about pricing.",How to Buy a Serger," Not everyone who sews needs one.

If items are being sewed to sell, a serger can provide a more professional look and finish. Purchase a serger if you do a lot of craft sewing as well.;
, Most sergers have 3-thread, 4-thread or 5-thread capability. If value is a priority, 3-thread sergers are usually the cheapest. A 5-thread model provides automatic jet stream threading, and is often more expensive. An average 4-thread serger is a good option for most purposes.

, Sergers are available with a variety of bells and whistles. They can include a differential feed, which adjusts the way fabrics feed under the needle, needle threaders, various tension adjustment settings, and specialty feet that can embellish decorations such as attaching lace or beads.


Select a power method. Sergers can be mechanical, computerized or electric.

, Sergers can be purchased online, but it is a good idea to look at them and try them out in person. They can be purchased at specialty sewing machine stores, craft stores, hardware stores and department stores. Ask a salesperson for a demonstration on how different sergers work. Get an idea of what is available, and how several different models work.


Test serger models on fabric, if possible. Bring different kinds of fabrics with you to the store to see how the serger works with them.

, Serger prices range from hundreds of dollars to thousands of dollars. Inquire about sales and warranties, as well as return policies and payment plans. Be sure to find out what the policy is when repairs or replacements are needed. Some stores will be able to make necessary repairs on-site, and others will need to send the machine out to a specialist if it needs to be fixed.

, Pin or baste in place.

, Pin or baste in place. If the fabric is particularly slippery, you may also wish to press or starch the folded edges with a hot iron.

, This top stitched edge will be the top edge of the pocket.

, Do this by folding the rectangle ""hot dog"" style, so that the two long edges lie parallel and together. Use pins or tailors chalk to mark the center line.

, Measure up along the center line from the short edge. Mark the 7 inch (18cm) point with pins or chalk.

, These three points will make the lines on which you need to place the pocket., Take care to place the top stitched edge up.

,,, Fold the 13 x 7 inches (33cm x 18cm) rectangle with right sides together. Fold it ""hot dog"" style, so that you create a 13 x 3.5 inch (33cm x 9cm) rectangle.

,,, About half of the flap should overlap the top edge of the pocket., (This pocket measures 10 x 12 inches (25cm x 30cm) when finished, a good size for some children's books or a notebook.)

Note that if you place the folded edge of the flap down over the pocket, that the opening left for “turning right side out” will be stitched closed as you top stitch the flap to the bag., Sew down one side, across the bottom, and up the other side. Miter corners and finish the seam with either zig zag stitch or rolling the seam while stitching to hide any raw edges and prevent fraying.

, Stitch the seam allowances flat on either side of this to hold them down and out of the way when your drawstring is pulled through.

, Be sure that the ""right"" side (patterned side) of the fabric is facing the outside of the bag. Pin or baste in place.
,,, Tie or sew ends of the cordage to create a loop. (Prevents the cord from getting lost or pulled out of the channel.)

, Just keep in mind that bags intended for small children should be devoid of anything which they could tear off and swallow. (Fabric paints are a good alternative.), Enjoy the feeling of accomplishment and goodwill you have created with your simple act of generosity.

Make vintage vases.,
Turn old Mason jars into gilded vases.,
Use a doily to dress up a vase.",How to Make Spring Crafts2," For this project, you will need nine vintage milk bottles and gardener’s twine. Line up the nine bottles in three rows of three. Wrap the twine around the bottles twice to attach them to each other.Tie the ends of twine together in a nice bow.
Place two or three flowers in each vase and use the arrangement as a centerpiece.
Make sure the milk bottles are all the same size.

, For this project, you’ll need several mason jars (size doesn’t matter), a foam brush, adhesive and sheets of gold leaf. Apply adhesive to each of the jars in small, random patches.Wait 30 minutes for the adhesive to turn clear.
Press the sheets of gold leaf onto the jars. Rub away any excess leafing with a paper towel.
All of the materials for this project can be purchased at a craft store.

, Start by wrapping a doily around a vase (make sure the doily is wrapped tight). Use sewing scissors to remove any excess fabric, then sew the doily around the vase, making sure it fits snugly.Use a clear glass for a more elegant looking vase.
Try using a blue glass vase paired with a off-white handkerchief for a more modern take on this project.
Fill the vase with flowers and use it to brighten up your kitchen.

Transform a Mason jar into a soap dispenser.,
Make a table runner out of handkerchiefs.,
Make a napkin ring out of a bandana.",How to Make Spring Crafts3," Start by measuring the center of the jar’s lid; mark the center of the jar with a pen. Take a ½” high-speed drill bit and drill a hole in the center of the jar lid (make sure the hole is big enough to fit a pump from a soap dispenser).Pour liquid soap into the jar, put the lid back on and place the pump inside the hole.
You can use scissors to trim the bottom of the pump if it’s too long for the jar.
Soap dispenser pumps can be purchased online, or recycled from old soap dispensers.

, Start by measuring the length of the table you want to cover (add a couple of inches on each side so the runner has some overhang). For an 82-inch-long table, use ten 12-inch handkerchiefs.Place two handkerchiefs pattern side down and pin them together so the edges have 3/8” worth of overlap.
Stitch the handkerchiefs together.
Repeat this process until all the handkerchiefs have been attached to form one long runner.

, Cut a colorful bandana into 6 x 9 inch strips (you will get a different number of strips depending on the size of the bandana). Take each strip and fold it lengthwise into thirds, then do the same thing widthwise.Sew a button on each bandana strip, approximately 1 inch from the edge.
Cut a buttonhole using scissors on the opposite end of the strip.
Loop the bandana strip around a rolled up white napkin and button the strip to secure it in place.

Get your materials.,
Make the stopper.,
Prepare the copper coil.,
Make your condenser.,
Place the coil in the condenser.,
Connect the tube to the pot.,
Insert the thermometer.,
Use the still correctly.",How to Build a Still1," You will need a variety of materials, most of which you can get at your local hardware store. Bending copper tubing is involved, so if you really want to make your life easier, you can get a tool which helps you bend tubes (found in the plumbing department of your local hardware store). The materials you'll really need are:


You'll need a kettle or a pressure cooker (preferably copper,or stainless steel, absolutely never aluminum or lead)
A cork or rubber stopper which will fit the opening of your kettle or pressure cooker
~8mm copper tubing (amount will depend on set up, 10-20 ft is a good amount)
A very large thermos/small watercooler or a plastic bucket (if you're cheap)
Tube couplings (maybe)
A thermometer
A good drill
Some silicon or Sugru;
, Drill two holes in your rubber or cork, one for the copper tube and one for the thermometer. These holes should be very slightly smaller than the tube and thermometer, to create a tight fit. Make sure the stopper you use is generally cut to tightly fit the opening of your kettle or pressure cooker.

, You will need a copper coil to condense the vapor coming from the pot. Take your 8mm copper tubing and shape it into a coil towards one end. You will need a long straight section and a short (at least 6"") straight section on each side of the coil. To bend the coil, you can simply bend it around an object or you can use tools designed for bending tube. The coil should be small enough to fit in the thermos or watercooler, with about 1"" of space on either side.


These copper coils tend to kink very easily. To avoid this, you can block the tube at one end and fill the tube with salt or sugar (never use sand). Use a funnel and make sure to shake the tube as you fill it to make sure that it fills evenly.

, The watercooler will be your condenser. Drill a hole on the side at the bottom, where the short section of copper tube will come out and deposit your distilled product. Then, drill a hole at the top on the lid. This is where the long section of tube will come out.

, Put the copper tubing in the condenser, threading the short end through the hole at the bottom. Once enough of the short end is coming out of the condenser, seal the edges of the hole with silicon or other material, like Sugru or caulk. Then, thread the long straight section of the tube through the hole at the top.


If you want it to be easier to get the lid on and off, cut the tube a few inches after it comes out the hole on the top. Have a separate section which spans the distance and goes into the kettle. Connect the two with couplings, which can be undone as necessary.
Make sure you unplug the tube if you did so to fill it with salt. You will also want to empty the tube and rinse out the salt before doing this step, although, it can also be done afterwards, with a greater amount of difficulty.

, Connect the long portion of the tube to the kettle or pressure cooker, by inserting the other end of the tube into the kettle. It should be inserted only enough to reach inside the kettle, not be submerged in the liquid.

, Insert the thermometer into the appropriate hole. Make sure it is place deep enough that the end will be submerged but that it will not touch the bottom or the sides of the pot.

, Fill the condenser with ice, water, and rock salt. Make sure you use this still on an electric stove, as open flames can cause problems. Do not heat the pot once everything has boiled away, and generally be careful as pressure can build up if you have done something incorrectly. If distilling alcohol, don't drink anything which comes out when the temperature reads below 173 F or you will be treated to the best in beverages that make you blind.

Keep several bagged crafts handy to throw into your purse at the last moment.,

Don't forget drawing and writing, if you enjoy those activities.",How to Make a Travel Size Craft Kit," Things like Braiding, Macrame, Origami, German Ribbon Stars, small Sewing Projects and Ribbon Bookmarks are perfect for this sort of craft kit.
, If you regularly carry a backpack or you can leave items in your car, you have more options than if you are carrying a tiny purse or have only the space in a pocket., You can't exactly take along an entire afghan, but you may be able to take along just enough for a few squares at a time.,

For example:
A small pincushion would require only fabric, a pinch of stuffing, a needle and a spool of matching thread.
A star ornament requires only the knowledge of three folds and a spool of gift ribbon.

Macrame Jewelry would require only a spool of jute and a bag of beads.
Origami requires only paper and instructions. (folds flat! Great for stuffing down the side of your purse for a boredom emergency!)

Dollar bill origami uses the cash in your pocket instead of origami paper, and is a great way to leave a creative tip and kill time while waiting for the check in a restaurant. All you need is small bills and instructions.
A spool of quarter-inch ribbon is all that is needed for a Ribbon Bookmark.
Two or three skeins of embroidery floss will make any number of friendship bracelets. Pocket-sized embroidery kits are available to make tiny ornaments.
A crochet hook and a small ball of string or yarn is enough for a granny square, motif, or other small project or part of a larger project.
Use your imagination. there are lots of fun things to do that take up less than a quart bag in volume.

,,, You never know when you'll have a spare 10 minutes to fill!, A small notebook and a pencil can keep you busy for hours, and you might just create (or conceive) your next masterpiece while waiting in line. You can also use your notebook to dream up and sketch larger projects."

Gather your materials.,
Dig a hole.,
Insert your container.,
Add plant material.,
Cover your hole.,
Add a weight.,
Seal the edges.,
Wait for moisture to collect.,
Drink!",How to Build a Still2," You will need a container for the distilled water, a plastic sheet and a shovel. You may also want some plastic tubing.

, Dig a hole about as large as the plastic sheet and deep enough so that when you weigh the center of the sheet down, there will be several inches between the bottom of the sheet and the bottom of the hole.


This is the sort of still that would be good if you actually have to distill your drinking water. If you get stranded on a desert island, this is your best option.

, Set your drinking container in the center of the hole and partially bury it to keep it from falling over. Insert one end of the plastic tubing into the container and lay the other end well outside the hole. The goal is to keep the tubing clean and secure so it doesn't fall back into the hole.

, Line the hole with cactus, leaves or other living plant parts if they are available. Placing plants in the hole isn't necessary, but will help your still produce more water.

, Cover the hole with a plastic sheet use rocks to weigh down the corners.

, Carefully place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet so it slopes downward at an angle of about 45 degrees; the lowest point should be directly over the container in the hole, but not touching it.

, Cover all edges of the plastic sheet with dirt or sand to keep water vapor from escaping. Take care not to cover the plastic tubing.

, Wait two or three hours for moisture to collect on the plastic sheet and run down the sides into the container.

, Drink the water through the plastic tubing. You can disassemble the still and drink directly from the container, but you will have to build the still again when you're through; in the meantime, any water vapor on the sheet will evaporate.

Place a weight at the center of the plastic.,
Wait for your water.",How to Build a Still3," This bowl can be plastic, aluminum, or steel, but it should NOT be made of lead. Put this bowl on a sunny surface outside.

, The cup or bowl should be shorter than the edges of the large bowl.

, Fill the large bowl with water but do not go over the edge of the small bowel or cup.

, Cover the bowl very tightly with plastic wrap. Use tape or rubber bands to ensure a tight seal.

, This should be right over your cup or bowl and should angle the plastic down. Make sure the plastic does not touch the cup, though. A good weight to use would be a rock.

, The sun will evaporate the water in the large bowl, causing the water vapor to rise and condense on the plastic. Since the plastic is weighted and angled, the condensation will roll down into your cup. Mmmm! Clean water!"

Stop when it is neatly melted.,
Make a small loop at the sealed end of the rope.,
Insert the umbrella's tip through the small loop you've just made.,
Fold the double cord very tightly.,
Done.",How to Make a Sling for an Umbrella,";
, Do this very carefully––watch closely to check that the tip is slowly melting and stop before you make an unsightly blob.


Mind you don't get a bad burn while the cord tip is hot.







, This hard tip will prevent the sheath and the inner part of the cord from fraying when you make the small loop for the tip of the umbrella.

, This will hold the tip of the umbrella firmly in place.

, Tighten the cord and fold it sharply at the tip of the handle of the umbrella. The length of the free end of the cord should be about a third of the umbrella's length. Cut and melt tip as explained above.

, Push hard to open the passage in the cord-lock and push the double cord firmly through this, so that you get an adjustable loop.


Attach it to the handle of your umbrella.






Make a single knot at the very tip of the free end of the cord to secure everything in place, while adjusting or when pocketing the sling in case of rain.







, You can now tote or hang the umbrella with ease.

Acquire your inventory.",How to Set Up an Arts Store," This can be a building, either bought or leased, or even an online site. Remember that you will need enough space to display all of the artwork that you have for sale. Also remember that you will need to make money. Although a high-rent location in the mall might seem like a trendy place to set up shop, make a careful cost analysis and think very hard on whether you can afford such a location or not.;
, Set up good external decoration. You are going to want something that will draw customers in. Remember that signs are good, and windows are even better. They will give you an opportunity to display your best pieces to the passing customer.

, These will allow you to present more art to your visitors. You will need to devise a way to manufacture these though, using wood or other materials. Try to pick something that fits the mood of your art gallery. Steps

, You will need to make sure the store is bright because some customers need check the quality of the artwork. This will help them better select a painting. Poor lighting may drive them away, or may lead them into buying a painting they would not like, losing repeat business.

, Art lovers and buyers are drawn to color, try to use it in decorating your store, but do not push it so far as to detract from the art work you have on display.

, There are many companies that can provide you with inexpensive pieces of art work. However, for best results, consider shopping around local art fairs and purchasing the work of up-and-coming local artists.

Remove the cardboard disks.,
Trim the pom pom.,
Use your finished pom pom.",How to Make a Pom Pom1," Cut out two cardboard circles and then cut out a wedge and a small hole in the middle of each circle so that your disks look like they have keyholes. Remember, the bigger the circles, the bigger your pom pom will be (and vice versa).








You can cut out a circle freehand or you can use a bowl or glass as a guide to trace the area you want to cut and then cut out the circle.;
, Place a piece of yarn so that it is going around the keyhole and then place the other cardboard disk over the yarn. Arrange the circles together so that the keyholes are lined up.








This piece of yarn will serve to secure your pom pom later on. Make sure the piece is long enough so that the ends hang out on either side of the keyhole., Insert the yarn through the wedge and into the center of the circle. Then, begin wrapping the yarn around and around the circle. Wrap the yarn around the circle about 100 times or until the yarn is as thick as you want it to be.








The thicker your yarn is, the denser your pom pom will be.

, Put the scissors in between the two circles of cardboard and cut open the wound thread or yarn around the outer edge. Go slowly and cut evenly.








As you cut the yarn, hold onto the ends of the extra piece of yarn that you placed between the cardboard circles. This yarn is what will secure the pom pom.

, Tie and knot the ends of the extra piece of yarn. Because of where you placed the yarn before you started, it should be in the perfect position to hold your pom pom together.







, After you secure the pom pom with the extra piece of thread, you can set the cardboard disks aside. Keep in mind that you can reuse these disks to make more pom poms, so do not discard them.







, Trim around the outside of the pom pom to even out the threads. Keep trimming until you are happy with the look of your pom pom. Trimming will make the pom pom will make it fluffy, dense, and round.








Make sure that you do not trim the ends of the yarn that you used to secure the pom pom unless you do not need them.

, You can now use your finish pom pom by attaching it to a knitting or crochet project. Use the yarn tails to attach it to a hat, scarf, sweater, or whatever you want.

, Fold the trash bags so that the tops and bottoms are lined up. Try to get all of the layers as even as possible.







, Cut the bags along the fold you just made so that you have a pile of 20 trash bag squares. Cut carefully and try not to leave any jagged edges.







, Start cutting from the edge into the center from the side you just cut. Cut slits in the bags every 1







, Gather the bags at the center, like holding a bunch of dry pasta, so that your fingers are around the uncut center and the strips you made are hanging. Secure the center by wrapping a bit of tape (electrical tape works best) around the uncut portion of the bags.







, Next, take the individual strips and begin to separate each piece of plastic. This will give the pom pom its volume. Crinkle the strips of plastic once they're pulled apart to make it even fuller.








Your pom pom is ready to use! Make another so you have a matching pair.

Hang the pom pom.",How to Make a Pom Pom3," Place the tissue paper on a flat surface and make sure that all of the edges are even.









You can use less tissue paper for smaller pom poms, or more for larger, fuller pom poms., Begin folding at one end of the tissue paper pile and fold the pieces in an accordion-fold pattern. This is when you fold the piece over in one direction first and then in the opposite direction after that. Keep folding in this alternating way until you reach the end of the stack.








If you want to make a small pom pom, then cut the strip in half after you do the accordion folds. This will give you two shorter strips that you can use to make pom poms., You can cut the ends so that they are pointed or make them rounded. The look of your pom pom will be different depending on which style you choose.








, Use a piece of fishing line, a wire, or a thick piece of thread to tie a knot around the middle of the folded tissue paper. Make sure that it is long enough so that you will be able to use it for hanging the pom pom when you are done.







, However, keep in mind that a small tear will probably not be noticeable, so you do not need to start over if you tear the paper once or twice.







, When you are finished fanning out the pom pom, you can hang it up to display it. Hang it from a hook on a wall or ceiling."

Think it through or sketch it out on paper.,

Make a sample.,

Start in your stash or even your scrap bin, not the craft store.,

Obtain any new tools or supplies you need.,
Begin the project and be persistent.",How to Choose a Craft Project," Your purpose might be to make a gift for someone, to have something to exchange with another crafter, to use up certain materials you have on hand, to practice or demonstrate a new technique, to produce a useful or decorative object, or to encapsulate memories or sentiments.

Knowing your purpose will guide your design decisions. For example, it will help you to create an item that is sufficiently durable to withstand its later use. A bag that will be used to carry objects will need sturdier materials and construction than a wall hanging.;
, Will you use or display the resulting craft yourself, give it to someone you know, or perhaps sell or trade the craft?

Thinking in terms of a purpose and an audience or recipient at the beginning will help you to choose a particular craft and design.
It will also focus the process itself and make it more likely that you will persist and complete the project.

, Give yourself the time and space to doodle or tinker without purpose or direction. This is the opposite of the previous two steps, but crafting is a creative endeavor. At least every now and then, don't be deliberate, at all; just play. You can use scraps and leftovers if you'd like to conserve resources., You may find inspiration in others' work, in what materials are available, in craft kits, in books or on websites. You may also find inspiration in nature, in your friends, in your life, and in what you want to express., If you have already done some crafts, show them off or demonstrate them to somebody you know. They may have insights you don't about how to use a particular technique or what sort of project to do next. Even if they don't add much, explaining something may put you in the right frame of mind to build on (or expand beyond) your earlier creations., Particularly if you are starting out with a new technique or craft, try a smaller sample piece to make sure it's something you enjoy and have a feel for. You might knit a small bag, rather than an entire sweater, especially if this is your first attempt knitting. Make a greeting card or bookmark rather than an entire scrapbook.

Work up to larger projects. If you know you can keep at it long enough to quilt an entire bedspread, go for it. If you're just starting out in quilting, go for a wall hanging, instead.

, If your project has directions, read them. Do they make sense? Do they call for techniques or stitches you don't yet know? If possible, read the direction before you buy the pattern or any other materials., If your project doesn't come with instructions, or if you'll be changing anything compared to plans or patterns you are following, plan how you'll go about it and make your own patterns or templates if you need to., If you do need to try a new technique, try it on a small piece or scrap material first to get the hang of it before using it on a larger project. Samples and test pieces can also help you gauge and size a knitted or crocheted work and see what a finished color combination will look like on a larger scale., If you already have a supply of yarn, fabric, paper, wood, or anything else, chances are you collected these items because they interested or inspired you somehow. Sometimes you will incorporate these materials into a larger project. Other times, you can create wonderful things from materials and tools you already have.

Use the serendipity of combining whatever is in there. You might come out with a different result than you originally envisioned, and that might be a good thing.
Consider the ordinary pencil and paper. You almost certainly have them already, and if you can use them skillfully, you can create a drawing or a novel or sketch out a new invention or compose a song, all with the same simple tools.

, Do this after you have reviewed your existing supplies and committed to the project.

Don't forget about the possibility of borrowing an item or buying it used, especially if it is a larger item or something you will only use rarely.
Sometimes you can improvise a piece of equipment or build your own from items you have.
Don't let a craft project get bogged down for lack of appropriate materials.

, Many craft projects will require some practice to master the technique; many more will take a lot of time."

Choose a duration for your time capsule.,
Decide where you will store your time capsule.,
Select a container.,
Consider an above ground option.,
Collect the objects to go in your time capsule.,
If you wish, write and enclose your own description of what it is like to live right now.,
Do something to remind yourself or others of the location of the time capsule and the date you intend it to be opened.,
Seal the time capsule to your satisfaction and store it for the selected amount of time.",How to Create a Time Capsule," One way to do this is to consider who you would like your audience to be. Would you like to open the time capsule yourself? Would you like to share it with your own children or grandchildren? Would you like your message to last long into the future?








, Burial may not be the best choice, for several reasons. It is very likely to be forgotten or lost, and it is much more susceptible to damage from moisture.








, How much stuff do you want to preserve for the future? Think about how long this collection must last and where it will go. If you will store it inside, at home, a shoebox, bin, or old suitcase might be quite adequate. If you plan to place the time capsule outdoors or bury the time capsule, you will have to choose a container that is highly weatherproof. Consider using desiccant ""gel bags"" such as those included in the packaging of electronic goods and in bottles of vitamin C tablets. These help to absorb any moisture that may have been present at the time of encapsulation or that may ingress in the future. They are also ""oxygen-scavengers"" that help to kill microbes that may make some of your items perish.








, One interesting alternative is to store your time capsule items in a stainless steel vacuum food jar (you could even try Space-bags) and then hide this inside a camouflaged polyurethane hollow rock or log. These above ground time capsules are called Geocapsules and can provide a further level of adventure to the time capsule experience.








, Who will open your time capsule, and what would you like to tell them? Have fun with this step! Objects for time capsules need not be of high monetary value. Rather, choose things that reflect the spirit of the present. What is unique about today? Anything that captures the spirit of the present is a candidate, but you might want to consider things like these:









Popular toys or tools.
Labels or packaging of favorite foods or other products. Include price tags, if you can.
Newspapers or magazines showing current events or current trends.
Photographs.
Filled Journals.
Letters
Currency
Favorite things.
Clothes and fashion items of the current time
Personal messages to and from others
Indicators of high technology. Even if nobody can read the contents of a DVD in 50 or 100 years, you might still enclose one to demonstrate the state of the art.

, Tell your future audience about daily life. Talk about ordinary day-to-day activities; current fads, fashions, attitudes, and trends; how much everyday objects usually cost; and anything else that you would like to say.








, If you keep a calendar, write at the end of it each year when your time capsule should be opened. Place a plaque or marker if you have hidden or buried the time capsule, indicating where it can be found. Record the date and whereabouts in a journal or scrapbook. If the time capsule is for personal use, choose an opening date with personal significance, such as your birthday, a child's birthday, or a major holiday in the chosen year. Or, record its whereabouts in your will, along with any special instructions. According to the International Time Capsule Society, most time capsules are ""lost due to thievery, secrecy or poor planning"". If your time capsule is intended for retrieval years or decades after its original placement, make doubly sure that several people know of its exact location and surroundings. If placed outside, above or underground, take photographs of your placement, identify GPS coordinates, and write down all data important for re-locating the precise location. Send multiple copies of the location data to those you can trust and ask them to hold the information for safekeeping. You can even schedule a future email to be sent to you as a retrieval reminder.








, Remember that a personal time capsule does not need to be of great duration or durability. Even five years from now, the world will have changed and the artifacts of today will stir memories.

Research the type of Kinkade painting you own.,
Pay for an appraisal of your painting.,
Take excellent photos of your painting.,
Put your painting on consignment with a Kinkade art gallery.,
Create an account on eBay to sell your painting.,
The rarity of the painting is likely to determine the number of bids you get.,
Consult a local art gallery or auction house.,
Research and contact art brokers.",How to Sell Thomas Kinkade Paintings," First, you should check whether it is still available on ThomasKinkade.com, because this will tell you whether it is sold out at the publisher. Find out which of the following categories describes your painting:


Original canvas paintings. These are originals of later published and produced pieces by Kinkade. They are arguably the most valuable of all his paintings.
Original plein air paintings. These oil landscape paintings were landscapes painted in a day. They are unpublished so the price can vary greatly.
Original paintings on paper. These oil paintings are rare and more valuable than the sketches.
Original sketch. These are usually charcoal sketches on paper. They sell highly especially if they include color and/or they are preliminary sketches for paintings that sold very well.
Studio and renaissance proofs. These include highlights and extra brush strokes to make them look more likely the originals.
Gallery proofs. These manufactured paintings include highlights and an embossed remarque. They are worth more than an artist proof.
An artist proof or examination proof. These are manufactured paintings based on Kinkade originals. They are highlighted by a master highlighter.;
, Call your art appraiser to ask if they can appraise Kinkade paintings. Get a written appraisal from them so that you can show it to people when selling, if need be.

, Make sure to use good lighting. Take photos of the painting from all angles, including a gallery shot, with your painting framed and hanging.


An art broker will charge a fee to sell your painting or ask for a commission on its selling price.







, Devoted Kinkade galleries often hold various paintings on consignment. You will likely be asked to sign a consignment agreement that states you will receive a percentage of the sale value minus any costs.


For example, the Thomas Kinkade Signature Gallery gives the consignor 70 percent of the sale price minus any costs.







, If you have a certificate of authenticity, you may be able to get a good price for the art on eBay. Research what other Kinkade paintings are selling for and set a minimum bid before starting an auction.

Consider what options you have for making bracelets.",How to Sell Bracelets," You may make fantastic friendship bracelets but so do many other people. It is important to make bracelets that are either hard to make/time consuming for others to make or are so unique and fascinating that they create their own niche of desire. If your bracelets already fit one or more of these requirements, then that's great. If not, you'll need to do some research and experimenting to increase the saleable nature of the bracelets you're producing. Things to consider include:


Do you need ""upskilling"" of any sort? Maybe taking a course in jewelry making will take your skills to the next level needed to produce amazing works of art from your bracelets?
How unique is your bracelet style? What about your bracelets suggests to potential wearers that they're wearing something different from the standard bracelets available out there? Check out what is happening in bracelet trends using online image searches such as Google Images or Pinterest.
Are your bracelets durable as well as beautiful? A buyer won't be happy if their gorgeous bracelet breaks on the first wear. Do plenty of testing by wearing them yourself. Ask friends to wear some of your creations and to give you feedback on how they feel, work and last. Keep notes of the feedback so that you can make improvements where needed.
Think of unique ways to develop the bracelet. For example, maybe you could make a bracelet that intertwines in some way with a FitBit, to make the FitBit fancier or more girly, or whatever else you can come up with. Work with what is current!;
, As lovely as your bracelets are, they must be affordable and you must be making a profit on them, otherwise they remain strictly within the realm of hobby fun. Do plenty of research on sourcing your materials at a cost that allows for you to sell the final bracelets at affordable prices, with a margin for profit. Draw up a budget sheet showing how you will manage this. Get help from a numbers-minded friend or family member, if needed.

The budget should cover materials costs, workshop costs, packaging costs, marketing costs and fuel costs. Your time is free, that's just the reality of being your own boss!
If you make high-end bracelets, be sure to develop your brand very carefully so as to indicate this from the outset. However, it would be wise to make more affordable bracelets to begin with, to build your financial base and renown for your design skills.

, You cannot run a business without an adequate quantity of products. For starting out, make at least 20 bracelets of each kind, in different colors or styles, as suited to your particular types of bracelet. The larger your range of styles, colors and sizes, the more customers you are likely to attract.


If trying to persuade a store to buy or sell your bracelets, have a display case or box which showcases each type of bracelet you are making as part of your brand. You can open this display up to let potential retailers of your bracelet see the variety and quality firsthand. Arranging the bracelets on a background such as rich velvet, satin, or similar can help to enhance the impression of high quality.

, This part cannot be overlooked because you are selling an item that is commonplace and available everywhere. Hence, you need to convince customers of the worth and uniqueness of your particular bracelets, so as to encourage them to want to buy yours. Consider the following when planning your brand:

What sets your bracelets apart from other bracelets? For example, you might have sourced the beads from Fair Trade creators and their use and sales help to support a local community. Or, you might have used stones that are said to have healing properties. Or, you might have used a unique technique that others don't use. Or, you might have a fine arts degree that makes your bracelets one of a kind in design. Whatever it is, tell the story!
What name are you going to use for your brand as a whole? Keep it punchy, clever and memorable.
Will each bracelet style have individual names?
Do you have a cool/interesting/eye-catching logo? Get one designed if you cannot do this yourself. It is an important part of your brand.
Will the bracelets come with anything of added value? For example, a box, a cloth bag, a certificate of authenticity, etc.?

, This will allow you to place your brand on each bracelet and to perhaps even add some text explaining the value of the bracelet in such terms as what it might do for the wearer, what special properties it might have and how it is the latest in fashion, etc., There are many possible options, depending on your finances, your ability and your interests. Some options include:

Selling from home. This is ideal for some people, especially children. Children could set up a sales stand in their front yard (if local laws permit) and sell to passers-by. Or, you could sell by consignment to neighbors, friends and family, all from your own home. You could have jewelry parties during which you feature your bracelets as well as providing delicious nibbles and fun gossip.
Sell online. Use an online storefront on such places as Etsy and eBay. Or, you could set up your own store using template stores offered by numerous websites. Each has different benefits and drawbacks, so spend some time researching the different options. It can often be helpful to use a trading site before launching your own website, to learn the ropes, and many sellers make use of both their own site and trading sites.
Sell through an existing store, such as a department store, an art gallery, a clothing store that accepts jewelry items on consignment, etc. Using an existing store makes it easier for you, as there are no overheads and you can either negotiate an outright buying price with the store or sell on consignment. However, you must guarantee a regular supply, especially if your line of bracelets gets plenty of sales.
Sell at local markets. These could be a regular arts and craft market or one-off seasonal markets that happen now and then. Make sure that the stall is as bright and colorful as possible, because it will be more eye-catching to customers. And include your logo!
A combination of some or all of the above suggestions. Having more than one source for your sales can be hugely helpful, especially in ensuring that your bracelet is getting known. In time, you may consider offering the bracelets from exclusive places if it gets really popular but that's well down the track for a beginner.

, If not, you'll need to find a business partner. This person can help you make and sell your bracelets, and give great advice on what to do. They can help you speed up the process of your money-making scheme, but bear in mind that they will most likely (and rightly) want a share of the profits.


Some business partners may be content to fund the operation but not help out. That's okay too, provided it is okay with you.

, If you are planning on selling on a street, outside your house or in a park, for example, you must comply with the rules about setting up sales in such areas. Fines make running a business a costly endeavor.

, If people have to fumble for prices or guess, they won't buy. This is especially so when shopping at market stalls. It isn't polite to hide prices; many people base their decision to buy on affordability and this means that they need to see the price, not be baited into handling the item to find the price, only to have the seller pounce on them with the hard sell. For online sales, ensure that prices include all sales tax and are absolutely easy to find.


Ensure that all prices are understandable, and inclusive of all taxes.
Be open to negotiation on prices when selling at stalls or by consignment. Have set prices for the viewing by the retailer but be ready to move on it slightly, as needed, during negotiations. Bulk lots usually necessitate some form of discounting.
If using auction sites, use a buy-it-now option always. Many a buyer is lost because they couldn't buy it when they wanted it; attention spans online are very short.
If selling by consignment, remember to include the seller's cut in your profit margin.

, Once you are into a good sales mode, you'll need to keep the stock up. This means making time to make more bracelets, to ensure that there is always a decent supply of stock ready to draw on. You never know when you might be asked for a bulk order of bracelets from a store or retailer wanting your items once they've become better known and sought after.

, Unless you're already skilled to some extent in making bracelets, you'll need to learn the techniques and practice a lot to perfect the skill before considering sales. Some ideas for making bracelets can be sourced from wikiHow and other online sites, while it is also a great idea to borrow books from the library, buy some books/patterns and perhaps attend a jewelry/beading class or two. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Make leather bracelets, plain, beaded, and intertwined with other items.

Make braided bracelets, remembering that they have to be of high quality and more creative than the standard schoolyard style of braided bracelets.

Make charm bracelets. These are a perennial favorite and can be themed to suit anything from cats and dogs to afternoon tea parties and cupcakes.

Make beaded bracelets. A classic form for the bracelet, these are often very beautiful. However, they can be hard to make well and care must be taken to ensure that they are original and not of the style every amateur beader is making.

Make paracord bracelets. These are very ""in"" in the mid teens of this millennium but it is a phase, so be wary of investing too much in this style.
Make devotional bracelets related to faith, belief and spiritual needs.
Make gold, silver and platinum bracelets. For these, you need to know metal smithing and how to create jewelry from precious metals. Perhaps something to work up to when you have a solid financial base to work with.
Many more ideas for bracelets can be found in wikiHow's Bracelet Projects category.

Keep your head above water.",How to Open an Art Gallery," The size, scope, and vision of the art gallery will depend on what is already available in the city or town where the new art gallery will open. Rely on experts such as artists and members of the business community to assess the market for your gallery. Try to gauge whether or not a type of art you are interested in or knowledgable about is adequately represented by current galleries in the area. If not, you have a starting place for your vision., In order to successful, an art gallery must have a well-defined vision. This vision is the purpose and identity of the gallery and informs everything from the design of the space and choice of artworks to the clientele the gallery will seek to attract. Think about what type of art you enjoy and also what types of work people in your area would be interested in. At the intersection of those two types, you can find your vision. Make sure that you are able to create a niche by having a separate vision from other galleries in town or in your area.


Keep your vision consistent. Don't back down or change your vision just because sales are low initially., Choose a type of work that you have a depth of knowledge in. Work to become extremely knowledgable in each piece you place in your gallery, even if you don't know everything about the art world in general. Buyers will feel more comfortable if you are able to explain each piece in depth and place it in context within the genre. For example, you should be able to explain the importance of the originality, socio-historical significance, meaning, subject matter, and modern relevance of each piece.


Make sure you can explain your art in a way that is not intimidating or off-putting to inexperienced visitors. That is, don't drop into high-level art lingo with new customers until you become aware of their own experience level., The art gallery location should be visible, easy to get to, and have enough interior space to house several collections of art. Many art galleries host parties and receptions for the artists, so the space will need to be able to accommodate food and drinks, as well as be hospitable to people mingling. Think realistically about how much you can spend on gallery space. You may not be able to afford a lease in the best part of town or for a huge space. However, make sure that your space is adequately spacious for your purposes and in a safe part of town.


Try looking in areas populated by other galleries, near art schools, or in up and coming areas.
If possible, look for a location with extra space so that you can expand later if you need to., Interior décor should be minimal and basic so that it does not compete with or take away from the art that will be on display. As with all aspects of your gallery, the interior design should match up with your vision. Make sure to include enough room to admire the art from a distance and to have open space from events. Leave room for a business office for yourself and for storage of pieces not currently on display.

, Businesses can have a variety of organizational structures, from sole proprietorships to corporations and partnerships. Each has its own advantages. Sole proprietorships simplify taxes for the business owner by combining their personal finances with those of the business. However, forming a corporation or LLC can protect the founder(s) from personal liability (their assets are separated from the those of the business). Incorporating a business requires another set of steps and these steps will vary based upon your location., Your business plan establishes how your gallery will get started, run its operations, market itself, and grow over time. Start with an executive summary of your gallery, including a summary of the rest of information in the plan and a brief description of your growth plan. Next, describe your business, including information like what type of art you will be focusing on, what market you hope to serve, and how you will carve out a niche among your competition. Include an analysis of your competitors and market.


Set out in clear terms your management structure, including ownership shares and profiles of managers.
Explain your funding requirements and how you plan to get that funding. This is important as your business plan will be used when acquiring business loans or investor money.
Include growth plans and revenue projections over the years.Explain how you plan to make money. Art galleries typically make a commission on sales. This can be as high as 50 percent for two-dimensional work and 40 percent for three-dimensional work., Funding an art gallery is similar to funding any other business. You will need money to lease your space, redecorate, and pay for utilities are other expenses. If you can afford it, your best option is to finance the business yourself, either alone or with your business partners. This will free you from having to pay off debt later. If this is not possible, you can always apply for business loans from a local bank or the Small Business Administration (SBA). In some cases, you may also have the option of gaining investors who will give you startup money in exchange for equity (a share of your business and its future profits).

, When you've located a space that love, make sure that you can afford it. You won't last long if your expenses (including rent) outweigh your sales and funding reserves. Try negotiating down an ideal space that is slightly out of your price range., In order to operate as a business, you will have to register a ""doing business as"" (DBA) name. This name must be different than just your name or the names of you and your partners. If you are organized as an LLC or corporation, you don't have to register a separate DBA name. Registration is done with your county clerk or with your state, depending on your location. This name will be used on all legal documents related to your business., Your gallery will have to be licensed to operate as business. The exact requirements for doing so vary by location, but at minimum you will need a business license issued by your city or state. The best way to find out what you need is to contact your local branch of the Small Business Administration (SBA) or an equivalent organization that offers help to small businesses. Try searching online for your location and ""business licensing"" to locate a government website that will explain what is required of you.You will need additional permits or licenses if you serve food or alcohol in your gallery.

, As a business, you will need to collect taxes from customers, pay taxes on your employees' wages, and file annual tax returns. Start by registering with your state to collect sales taxes. This is handled differently in each state so search online for the relevant tax authority in yours.Your tax filing requirements vary based on your business structure. See the IRS's guide for small business taxes at https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed.
To pay employees and (in most cases) to file taxes, you will need and Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the IRS. Visit their website to apply for one (it's free to do so)., Repaint and remodel the inside of your space to match your design that you thought up earlier. Work with the space you have, taking advantage of unique features and covering up flaws. Do as much of this work yourself as you possibly can to save on costs. And remember, when you're just starting out, the quality of the art is much more important than the quality of your gallery space. Focus on the art and the money for cosmetic improvements will come., Art gallery staff often includes a curator or a manager, who can help select art for the gallery and choose where and how to display it. A receptionist or office assistant will also be necessary to help with the telephones, paperwork, scheduling, give out information, and greet and welcome people into the gallery.


If you hire a curator or manager, hire one that can help keep your vision on track and work with you to make business choices., In order to locate artists, other gallery owners and dealers, and important collectors around your community, you will have to attend important local events. Make sure to join any local organizations, museums, or associations that pertain to art or your particular niche. Contribute your art, money, or gallery space to local charitable events to get your name and your gallery's name out there. This will help you recognize who you need to impress and become acquainted with and also help these people recognize you., Artists will want to put their work in galleries that are successful and well known. A new art gallery may have challenges in wooing artists, since there is no record of accomplishment yet. Network in the art community to get to know artists, and select new artists who will be anxious to give their work exposure. They might take a chance on the your new gallery if you are willing to take a chance on them.


As your knowledge of your specific niche and of the art community grows, you will become better at identifying artists to showcase in your gallery. You will be better able to identify trends and capitalize on them before your competitors., This will help you in understanding and promoting their work. It is only by becoming recognized and celebrated among artists that you will be able to showcase the best work. Work on attracting and keeping artists by displaying honestly and integrity in all of your transactions and interactions with them. In addition, always remember to pay your artists within the time specified in your contracts, if not earlier.Maintaining these relationships may also ensure that you remain their gallery of choice even when their work gains more recognition., Look at your collections through a business lens, not simply an artistic one. It is important to display art that you like, but more important to display art that will sell. Remember, you have to keep the lights before you can sell the art that you want to sell. Use your knowledge of art the market to choose investment pieces and art that will sell well given your market and clientele.Also remember to stay consistent between shows in your themes and levels of accomplishment of your artists. Visitors don't want to be confused by your inconsistency, as generally the art is confusing enough to them., Art valuations are such that it would be easy for a gallery to justify charging absurdly high prices for art, even if that price has no grounding in reality. To actual make sales though, you will need a legitimate reason to charge what you do for each piece. When customers ask, explain that the artist has a show at a big museum, that their work usually sells in this price range, that their last show sold out quickly, or another concrete reason for the price. Customers, even those buying for the emotional experience of the art alone, want to know they aren't wasting their money.


Also, when pricing your pieces, stay consistent throughout your shows. That is, don't showcase art that costs $100,000 in one show and then $1,000 pieces in the next. This will alienate customers at both price levels.Use your knowledge of market prices and your customers' purchasing power to price your art competitively. In many cases, you will be working for relatively small margins. However, a great dealer on the forefront of a new trend can make high-margin sales., A new art gallery needs to get a lot of attention before it opens, or soon after. Host a ribbon cutting ceremony, a formal art gallery opening with a reception, or an informal party to launch the art gallery. Make sure members of the local media are informed and invited to all events. Do a little advertising in print, on the radio, through television and online. Develop marketing materials such as brochures and post cards, and launch a website.


Once the art gallery opens, the marketing and public relations requirements will not cease. Word of mouth is a powerful tool and networking is essential.
Use your websites as another venue for displaying your collection. Include high-quality images of the art, descriptions of the piece, and artist bios online., Plan an event for opening your gallery and getting your name out there. For example, you can hold an event that showcases a group of similar artists. Invite the artists, your friends, and prominent members of the art community in your area. If possible, sell some of the pieces in the show to friends beforehand. Having pieces marked as sold might drive other attendees to buy other works., Establish profiles on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other social media sites to connect with your visitors and promote your showings. Make sure that everything you post in some way drives potential customers to your gallery and adheres to your vision., One the best ways to stay in business through the years is to cultivate a reliable customer base. These collectors understand and enjoy your particular specialization and are building collections by buying pieces from your gallery. Maintain and develop your own knowledge of your niche over time, and strive to get ahead of the curve on new artists and movements. Your group of collectors will appreciate your hard work and come to recognize you as an experienced and expert dealer.


Make sure to avoid the trap of creating a group of non-paying adorers. That is, recognize people who show up to your gallery events and fail to buy anything time after time. Your gallery should not be your own personal social club for friends.
Instead, make sure you keep your focus on the greater art community, drawing in new customers and gaining recognition outside of your social circles. Cater to new customers and actively seek their patronage.
Keep up with your customers and art critics by sending out a newsletter or announcements once or twice a month., Good salespeople know that the best way to make a sale is to know your customer first. So, start your conversations with visitors by working to assess their own interests and knowledge level. From here, you can change your own strategy to meet their needs within the range of their own experience level.


Also, when talking about a piece, don't just say how much you like it or how great the artists is. Instead, discuss its relevance and significance.
For example, talk about what the piece is trying to say, what concepts or movements it is inspired by, why it is worth owning, and how it can improve the visitor's own life., In the beginning, it will likely be difficult to pay the bills as you build a reputation and customer base. You'll likely have to get creative and offer up additional products or services from your gallery in order to stay in business. For example, many galleries also sell inexpensive prints or posters, and some may also sell clothing or products made by local artisans. As the gallery owner, you can also work as an independent designer or carry another part-time job to make ends meet. Finally, you may also be able to rent out gallery space to artists or art dealers. Just try anything you can to keep your gallery open until you can focus on your collection full-time."

It's a lot different to make crafts for fun than it is to have to produce them for full-time income. Be sure you enjoy doing the work enough to do it full time. Compare your crafts to others to make sure you are creating a product that people will want to buy and will be satisfied with.;
, There are many options for selling crafts. You could sell wholesale to retail stores or work as a retailer selling to individual customers. Another idea is to sell craft supplies. You can work from home, using a website and catalog as your storefront, or open a store of your own.

, Take some business courses or learn from books and websites about starting a home business. Become aware of finances, record keeping, and marketing to get a better grasp of how to start a craft business that is successful. Learn how to use word processing and spreadsheet software.

, If you have decided to work from home only, you'll still need a designated, organized space for craft production as well as an area for keeping records and doing administrative tasks. It doesn't have to be a huge area but should be a dedicated space. For a retail shop, consider a long term booth rental at a craft fair or flea market or a small shop. Another idea for a retail venture is to team up with other craftspeople to stock your store, or have them sell on consignment in your shop.

, Find out how to set up your business and tax structure. Decide whether to incorporate your business. The Small Business Administration and your local business association may offer free assistance.

, Ask about zoning regulations if you have a home business with customer traffic. Register your craft business with the Internal Revenue Service. Remember that if you sell food items, you will probably need to have your work area inspected and licensed.

, Insuring a retail space protects against property damage and liability.

, You can use a POTS (plain old telephone service) line, an online or cellular phone, as long as you have a dedicated phone number. Have a professional sounding recording for voicemail or use a remote answering service to take calls and notify you about new calls.

, If you are marketing as a wholesaler, have a simple catalogue printed that lists your items and costs.

, Have a blog to show off new products and add a personal touch with pictures of your studio and your crafting in action. Show off your products on Flickr, Facebook and other social networking sites.

, Get listed in online and printed directories of local businesses and the local phone directory.

, Consider placing ads in crafting magazines and websites. Join online forums to promote your crafts and network with other craftspeople. Market locally by donating products to events and displaying them in stores that sell related products.

, Etsy has low fees, a huge amount of traffic and comes up at the top in search engines. There are many other online crafts malls that don't get as much traffic but still could be a good choice for marketing a niche product.

There will probably be a small charge, so make sure you have enough stuff of a high enough quality to sell to cover this charge. You don't want to make a loss.;
, It's no good trying to sell the same things as every other person at the craft fair. Sell something different to reduce the competition.

, Different people prefer different sizes of artwork, depending on where they want to put it and how much money they are willing to spend. Create some large pieces which you can sell for a lot and will draw people to your stall, but also create lots of small ones which you can make quickly and sell cheaply.

, Putting paintings, photographs and other flat artwork in a frame makes it look more professional and encourages people to buy it. Choose a variety of simple frames and give people the option of exchanging the frame you have put a picture in for another.

, Display this prominently on your stall. People like to know a little bit about the person who has created the artwork they are buying.

, Consider both the cost of materials, the amount of time put into each piece and the size of the piece. Don't price your art so high that people won't buy it, but don't go so low that you don't make a good profit on it.

, Just dumping your stuff on a table won't inspire people to come and look at your artwork. Make the set up of your stall a work of art in itself to attract people to it. Get a table cloth (or just a plain piece of fabric) and cardboard boxes in different sizes. Use these to create a display on different heights so people can see your work easily.

, Don't push people into buying something, this puts people off. Be friendly and be prepared to answer any questions people may have about your artwork.

Doing your homework ahead of time will help you choose art shows that will the most lucrative for you.
Artists have to apply through a jury process in order to sell at art shows. Your art work will be judged and you can only sell in the medium you listed on your application. Selling art in non-approved mediums could result in fines or refused entry into future shows.

,


Selling at art shows is all about selling what patrons can afford to buy. Determine an average price for your work and what you feel it's worth. Take into consideration the kind of art show you're entering when you decide what to display. More expensive pieces would do well at a high-end show, but smaller shows or community art shows call for more economically priced pieces.
Choose art in a variety of sizes, colors and textures. This will draw attention to your booth, entice patrons by giving them a lot to choose from and increase your sales opportunities by appealing to a wider audience of art buyers.

,,


Display your art against a simple, neutrally colored display. Use white or beige backdrops to hang paintings or photographs and simple wooden or metal shelves for sculptures or pottery. This will keep the focus on your art and emphasize details in each piece.

,


Patrons at art shows are more likely to buy from an artist that is approachable and willing to answer questions, so greet each person that enters your booth and be attentive and friendly.

,


Stock your booth with bubble wrap, boxes and bags to package purchases for patrons. This will ensure that fragile pieces will make it home safely with the buyer. Practice wrapping a few in advance so you can do it quickly and effectively at the show.

Price and label items.,
Bring your own food.,
Remember your office supplies.,
Include promotional materials.,
Check the condition of displays.,
Get lots of rest.",How to Prepare for Craft Shows,"


Prepare items to sell at craft shows by making a complete list of all the inventory you're taking with you. List items by lowest to highest price or by size and include details like color or sizes. This inventory list will help you find items quickly if a shopper wants something specific and allows you to track which items sell better than others.;
,


You will have plenty to do setting up your booth and arranging your displays on the day of the show, so get ready for craft shows by pricing and labeling individual items before packing them for the show. This can be time-consuming, but it's important to price and label everything correctly, so do it the night before when you have the time to make sure it's done right.

,


You might be in your booth by yourself for the whole show, so be sure to include a cooler with snacks and beverages when you prepare for a craft show. This will eliminate the extra cost of having to buy food there and will help keep you focused and energized throughout the show.

,


In addition to your crafts and displays, you need to bring a number of office supplies to the craft show. Be sure to bring bags for customer purchases, chairs, receipts, a credit card machine and tape, pens or pencils, notepaper, a stapler and staples. These are all items that will be needed to complete a purchase, so organize them and have them ready to go.

,


Use the craft show as an advertising opportunity by bringing plenty of business cards or flyers to hand out or include in bags with customer purchases. If you sell at a lot of craft shows, consider investing in a banner for the front of your booth to attract more attention.

,


Check out all of the display units you will use to show your art or crafts and verify that they're in good working order. Dust or polish them if necessary, wash any tablecloths or covers and be sure you have any nails, screws, bolts or tools needed for assembly at the show.

,


Prepare yourself physically for craft shows by getting plenty of sleep the night before. Being well-rested will keep you going through the day, help you stay positive if sales are slow and give you the energy to be your own best salesperson.

Determine where you are going to sell, and think about your options.,
Sign up.,
Prepare.,
Create a display that is appealing to the eye.,
Make the prices obvious.,
Get to the craft show early.,
Sell away!",How to Participate in a Crafts Show," It's important to match the style of fair to the craft you're making. For example, if you make and sell jewelry, a woodworking fair might not be the best choice for you; on the other hand, if it's a generalist craft fair or one set up solely for holiday season gifts, a range of crafts would be acceptable. Try to find a show that is both nearby and is focused on the product you are selling.;
, Most shows and fairs have a small fee for table space. If you need a trestle or table, they'll often charge extra for this and if you need power, there may also be a fee for using their electricity. Be sure to read the terms and conditions of participation carefully and ensure that what they provide meets your needs.


If you want to save money, it is best to sign up early, as prices tend to increase as the event approaches.

, Have change on hand: about 20 $1 notes, 6 $5 notes, 2 $10 notes and a couple of $20 notes (if necessary). If your product is on the less pricey side, you probably won't need to carry bills of high value, but it's good to be prepared.  


In some cases, having cordless credit card devices can be helpful but consider the credit charges you have to cover before investing in this.
Have your business cards ready. Place them in a small holder that can be left on the table. Sometimes people prefer to go away and think and will then contact you about an item later. It's also useful to hand out cards to great customers, suggesting they check out your website, shop or other sales medium.

, The exact type of display will depend on your product but key things to consider include:


Ensure that the product display is safe and that should the table or trestle be bumped, things won't roll everywhere. Customers will lean and mill around, so create the display with this in mind.
Put items on the table so that they can easily viewed. If you don't want anything handled, make signs and place them in front of those objects, explaining that the item is fragile and that you're happy to help open/work/show it as required.
Cover the table with a cloth of some sort. This protects your items and sets your table apart from other tables.
Include neat and pleasant signage on the table. It shouldn't overwhelm the products in any way, or distract the eye away from the products.

, Show the price either on the product or on a separate sign that details the price range for particular products. Be aware that most people don't like to ask, so don't force them. You will lose customers if they feel they have no alternative but to ask.

, It is much easier setting up before customers arrive and you will likely be able to get your vehicle close early but then have to shift it out of the way for customers. Your space or table will most likely be reserved, but if you have the option to choose, place yourself near a table selling items that you think will be popular. The more people nearby, the more will buy.  


Set up promptly, some people get to craft shows early.
You also may want to make friendly conversation with the booths beside you––if you're friends, they'll be more likely to spare you that five dollar bill you are short of and watch your table when you need the bathroom.

, Try to look happy and ready for any questions a customer might have.  When someone comes to your booth, offer them assistance or provide a brief description of what you sell. Don't hassle people who don't appear interested in small talk––many customers simply like to browse without being worn out by constant chatter. Let them make their choices, ask you questions and then make the chatter.

If making garments is your specialty, sew a few sample dresses or other garments to show to potential buyers. Let buyers know that the items are only samples and offer to sew garments based on the buyer's measurements.






Sew handbags or other accessories. Purses and bags are popular items at craft fairs and online shops, so think of a way to put your sewing skills to use to come up with a design that sets your bags apart.






For example, you might want to sew bags with LED lights sewn into the front. Another idea would be to make a purse that can fold up to fit in a pocket when not in use.;
,


You don't want to start an online shop or attend a craft fair and have only 1 or 2 items for sale. Make at least 20 hand-sewn items before you put your shop up online or register for craft fairs.
Don't go overboard purchasing materials. You don't want to end up with massive amounts of unsold inventory if your home sewing business doesn't take off.

,


Before applying to any craft fair, look at the style of the fair and the type of items that vendors sell to determine whether your items will be a good fit.
For example, if you sew traditional items, you may not fit in at a more trendy or contemporary craft fair.
Some craft fairs want a wide range of items and may not accept you if you sew items that are common, such as purses or skirts.
Scout out the craft fair while you're there to meet other artists and to see what other crafters are doing. Bring along a friend to watch your table while you walk around the craft fair.

,

The cost of traveling to craft fairs can add up. You'll also have to pay for the table or booth, as well as materials to display your hand-sewn items.

,


Register for an account at an online handmade listing site. You can do this in place of selling at craft fairs to make your sewing business truly a home business.
List your items on the site and set prices for them. Set your prices so that you'll actually make money.

Rotate your charitable crafts.",How to Make Crafts for Charity1," Although in some situations you may need to expand your crafting repertoire, the best and most efficient way to contribute crafts to someone in need is to do what you already know. For example, a quilt guild may make quilts and jewelry makers should choose to make jewelry.


Try doing an Internet search that includes your craft and ""for charity"" in the search terms. This will give you examples of charities and what other people have done.;
,


Before donating crafts or money to a charity, ensure that it is authentic. You can check this at http://charitynavigator.org.

, Many groups like to dedicate 1 month each year or a few weekends to making crafts to send to an organization they support. The more people who get involved, the more help you will be.

Consider creating a group that crafts for charity that includes teenagers or elderly people. A charity crafting class could be a mother/daughter operation, or it could take place at a retirement community. Many elderly people knit, crochet or embroider and may be interested in meeting with people who are of a different generation.

, Most charities have instructions about the sizes of the crafts that are made, the materials and, in some cases, the patterns. Although most crafters love to be creative, make sure you are doing it within the confines of these instructions.

, Corporate responsibility leads many large stores to look for charities to support, while local small businesses may enjoy both the ethical and marketing benefits of donating materials to a charity crafting group.


In most cases it is unlikely that all materials would be donated. You should expect to have to buy some materials. If you have a group, then you can share the burden of costs as well as time creating the project.

, For example, October is breast cancer awareness month, so you could contribute to a charity and use pink material, and December is AIDS awareness month, so a red craft for an AIDS charity might be preferable. You can increase your craft knowledge while contributing to a number of charities.

Consider combining your name with the type of craft or an element of your craft when finding a suitable name for the domain. Sometimes your name alone may suffice.
When coming up with an idea for the domain name, say it out loud. Sometimes what looks good on paper sounds strange when spoken.;
, Customers will be curious to know more about the person behind the crafts and it is also a good way to build online rapport. Don't embellish and make it too long but do point out key motivations, your training/background, and your previous experience.

, You need to be able to manipulate and update the site with great ease, all the more important if you're not fully conversant with HTML and other markup language or with programming.

, Use high quality photos (learn how to take good product photos) and if it's possible, include the ability for the viewer to turn the product around and see more than one perspective of it. If the product comes in several colors, consider adding a tool that allows the customer to change the shade to see the final look.

, Keep photos to a good size but one that can cope with slower download times. Also, don't embellish the site with too many distractions. While it is nice to provide information related to the products and links, these can distract the consumer and you might even lose them by following another link. Stick with information pertinent to the craft products and don't put barriers in the customer's way.

, This way you can keep customers informed about new stock, send them information about the craft you're making and even ebooks if that is something you're keen on putting together. A regular newsletter can be a great way to keep clients interested and involved.

, Remove broken links, old stock photos, outdated information on a regular basis so that the customer is assured that the information is current and reliable. Make new products really obvious with special designation on the homepage of their category.

, Keep a page where your craft has been noted by others in the press, at shows, and where you have won awards. All of this adds to your reputation and credibility and encourages the customers to see you as a popular craftsperson.

, If you sell in stores, explain where and use Google Maps to help them locate a store near them. Ask your web designer to help you with this is you don't know how.

, Be sure to actively maintain your Twitter and Facebook accounts so that customers feel engaged with you.

Make cloth diapers for local women's shelters. You can also make baby blankets, children's toys, baby socks and hats. These can be sent in kits or individually to expecting or new mothers who are in need.
Create quilts for the fire department or police department. You can create simple quilts to be handed out to people who have had car accidents or who've had a fire. They will help people in shock and be a comfort that they can keep through hard times.
Can, grow or make foods for the local food bank. Approach your local food bank to find out what foods are permissible. They most likely have to follow state food preparation standards. They may be able to direct you to other group homes or centers that are in need of prepared food.

Hold a craft sale where all the proceeds go to charity.",How to Make Crafts for Charity3," This is a great idea if you want to donate to a charity but they only take monetary donations. There are no limits to what each person who crafts can bring to the event to sell, so be as creative as possible.


Most radio stations, television stations and newspapers will run ads at no-cost or a cut rate for charity events. Make sure to promote your event, so that you sell all your crafts. Create posters and put them up all around your town. Many businesses are happy to put charity announcements in their stores.
Ask for donations from local quilt guilds, knitting bees, jewelry-making groups and other crafting classes. They may want to offer some goods for sale to benefit your cause.
Ask a public area, such as a parking lot or an auditorium if they are willing to let you have your craft sale at no cost in their location. You want to choose a place that is easily accessible to the public.

You can also build a business from organizing scrapbooking events, creating or making scrapbooking products, designing scrapbooking websites, etc.;
, If you have an artistic ability for making scrapbooks, for example, you may be able to earn lucrative profits by doing high-end work for others.

, Decide what kind of customers you want to target for your business. Factors to think about may include your customers' age range, income level, geographic region, whether they scrapbook themselves or want someone to do it for them, etc.

, Choose areas to market in that will be visible to your potential desired customers.

, Starting with a few products and expanding after you see growth in sales is a good way to keep start up costs low. It will also be easier to organize your business.

, In order to sell online and in your community, you will need to get an idea what similar products are being sold for. Price your items according to competition, quality and production costs.

, If you are making large quantities of items, consider looking for wholesale suppliers online or in catalogs instead of going to local craft stores. This will help you to increase your profit margin from a sale.

, You may choose 1 or more of the following options:


Set up your own website. You will want to create a logo, brand and promotional schedule in order to maximize profits from this expense. Pay attention to the shopping cart services, and make sure it keeps good track of sales, returns and refunds.
Sign up for an account on Etsy. This craft marketplace is perfect for people who have less start up capital, but want an attractive site with an excellent secure checkout process.
Go to local farmer's markets and fairs. Choose your fairs carefully based on the other crafts available, the cost of a booth, the timing and the clientele. Going to every market in your area is likely to leave you with disappointing sales.
Ask a popular craft seller to sell your crafts on their website or at their store. This outlet may ask for a portion of the profits. If so, keep track of that percentage on all sales so that you will have accurate bookkeeping.
Sell on eBay and Craigslist. You can post and sell for almost no cost. However, remember that all income from these sales must be reported to the tax authorities as income.
Sell customized versions of your products in bulk to companies, schools and organizations. You will have to develop wholesale contracts and workout the profit margin you would like from selling in bulk with a discount.

",How to Make Your Windows Look Like Stained Glass,"
* Keep your designs simple to start out with. Small intricate patterns are difficult to do so that they can be seen once the design  is finished. If you want to simulate cut glass designs, draw your base design first, then draw in random connecting lines throughout your base design.
*Make sure your design will touch all four sides, or separate any large amount of clear space with a leaded line.;
, This can be a purchased sheet or you can use any flat, clear, smooth plastic cover such as those from a disposable container if it is large enough to fit your design.

, You should practice just making straight lines and circles first to get used to how the liquid flows. You need to be able to control the flow so your lines are even and not blotchy or wiggly.

, Applying color while leading still wet can result in blurred outlines.

, If you don't there will be holes in the design and it will be more difficult to peel off. For large areas, you may use a palette  knife or a small spatula to smooth the color.

, The thicker the application, the longer the drying time. Test several areas before trying to peel off design.

,, It will stick on the window and  it can be peeled off and repositioned.


If the design doesn't stick, make sure the window is clean and dampen the back of the design slightly with a moist (not wet!)paper towel.
If portions of the design fails to stick, press your hand against the area and leave for 5 minutes to warm the area and make it more pliable.

Create your desired shapes.,
Prepare your soldering materials.,
Cut a piece of copper foil that will wrap around the edge of the glass you want to solder.,
Remove the backing from the strip of adhesive foil.,
Place the adhesive side of the copper foil on the edge of the piece of glass.,
Fold the excess copper foil onto the face of the glass.,
Firmly run a pencil over all areas where the foil touches the glass.,

Touch the tip of the soldering iron to the tip of the unrolled solder.,
Steadily move both hands along the line of intersection, between the two pieces of glass.,
Remove the tip of the soldering iron from the solder once you have reached the end of the seam.,
Repeat these steps to add each additional piece of glass to your project.",How to Solder Stained Glass," The towel will keep the glass from sliding around and will catch any small fragments of glass that break off in the cutting process.;
, Using your glass cutter, press down firmly and make one single score, from one edge to the other, where you'd like the glass to break. It is very important to make only one score line in order to get a clean break.

, The simplest way to do this is by holding the glass with one hand on each side of the line. Make a quick snapping motion and the glass will separate along the score line.

, Continue scoring and breaking glass until you create your desired shapes. Most stained glass projects use pieces that fit together like a puzzle. If you are looking for pattern ideas, you can purchase a book from your local craft store that gives examples of popular stained glass patterns.

, Set out your copper foil, liquid flux, and coil of solder. Plug in your soldering iron and allow it to heat to its prime temperature. It is important to have everything set up prior to beginning the soldering process because quick timing is crucial in this project.

, Measure this by lining up the copper foil along the edge of the glass, leaving about 1/8"" on each end. Then cut the foil with your scissors. You can also buy strips of copper foil from craft stores

, You should be able to easily strip away the paper backing from the foil, revealing the adhesive side.

, Try to position the edge of glass directly on the center of the copper foil.

, It is helpful to use a pencil to push the small remaining edges of foil onto the face.

, This is very important because it will smooth out the copper foil and create a stronger bond with the glass.

,, The flux will encourage the metal in the copper and the solder to adhere more strongly.

, Leave a very thin gap (about 1/16"") between the two pieces so the solder will be able to flow into the seam.

, This will melt to form the bond between the two pieces of glass.

, This can be reversed if you are left-handed. Choose whichever is more comfortable for you.

, The best results are achieved by letting the melted solder drop into the seam between the pieces of glass.

, It will immediately begin to melt the solder and the solder will drop into the seam.

, Move quickly enough so that the melted solder does not not bunch up in one area, but slow enough so that the entire seam gets coated with the bead of solder.

, You should see a continuous line of solder along the intersection of the two pieces of glass. The glass is now strongly bonded together.

, The more times you practice this process, the more comfortable you will feel and the cleaner your soldering lines will look.

Consider hiring an accountant.",How to Organize Sales for a Craft Business2," You will need to figure out the rate and collect it on all sales in your state to submit in the future. Read your state's laws on collecting tax for online sales.

, Buy receipt books from office supply stores that have carbon copies. Give the white copy to your customer and save all carbon copies for bookkeeping purchases.

, If you make more than a couple of sales each year, you should have a program that organizes your costs, inventory, prices, sales and more for easy bookkeeping.


Buy bookkeeping software, such as Quickbooks to keep your information all in 1 place. You can also try the online bookkeeping sites, Stitch Labs or Outright, which is intended for craft sellers. You can keep track of your sales from all venues, inventory, expenses and business contacts for a monthly fee of $10 to $25 per month. The advantage of these products is that they keep a double-entry system, the standard for accurate accounting.
If you do not make enough in sales to warrant the expense of bookkeeping software, keep very detailed spreadsheets. Keep a sheet for every month of the year. List reoccurring expenses, variable expenses, each individual sale and tax collected. Calculate your income on an ongoing basis, instead of waiting until the end of the month. If you do not know how to work formulas in a spreadsheet program, sign up to take a class with a community college, lifelong learning center or public library.

, Once you have a dedicated account, you are able to pay for expenses through the account and deposit your sales income. Your online statement will give you an opportunity to double check your accounting work to ensure your check book balances according to your spreadsheet or bookkeeping system.

, Don't allow your bookkeeping to get too far behind, so enter sales as soon as possible. Save your receipts in a file folder in chronological order.


If you use an online bookkeeping system, you may want to invest in a free online receipt tracking site like shoeboxed.com. You can scan all your receipts from both expenses and sales and save them under headings. This will eliminate the risk of losing your receipts, if you have them in 2 places.

, List the sales individually under the venue. Then, input the expenses associated with each individual fair, seller or online site to figure out the profitability of that venue.


Online and software bookkeeping programs should allow you to do this automatically by associating each sale and expense with a type of account. Use your spreadsheet or program to regularly assess your income and remove any channels that aren't profitable.

, Do not wait until the end of the year to find mistakes that can cost you money or put you at risk for an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

, If you have large revenue from craft sales, you may be required to submit quarterly or bi-annual returns as well as yearly returns. Although this may take more time, it can allow you to pay taxes slowly, instead of in 1 lump sum.

, If you have a large amount of sales, receipts and expenses, then a tax professional is more likely to help you pay accurate taxes. By having a strong grasp of small businesses, an accountant may be able to save you money through tax credits and exemptions.

Clamp the torch head and gas canister to the table (follow instructions provided by the manufacturer).;
, Make sure you can get to everything without reaching across the torch (even when off it will retain heat).

, Take each one and rub firmly with wire wool. This cleans the metal and helps the bead release adhere to the surface.

, Dip each mandrel in the bead release and leave to dry. Some bead releases can be dried in the flame; however, if yours does not say to do this, then leave to air dry, as it may crack otherwise.

, Discard any mandrels with cracked bead release because if the glass comes in contact with the mandrel, it will stick and will likely be impossible to remove.

, Bring up a lit match from underneath to light it.

, A bushy flame means you have too much gas.

, Take it into your dominant hand and, holding it horizontally, slowly wave it in and out of the flame just above the tip of the blue cone. If you heat the glass too quickly then it may ""shock"" or shatter.

, Put the bead and mandrel in between two sheets of fiber blanket, or into a pot of vermiculite to cool. Be careful not to disturb the bead – if it cools too fast it may crack.


To check if your bead is cool enough to go into the fiber blanket or vermiculite without damaging it, hold the bead under your work area (don't forget to rotate) and see if it is still glowing – as soon as the glow fades, put it into the fiber blanket or vermiculite.

, If you have trouble removing the bead, grip the mandrel with a pair of vise pliers and try to twist and pull the bead off.

, Then scrub the inside with a bead reamer or a pipe cleaner. Now your bead is ready to use.


If wished, surface treatments such as etching can also be used at this point.

Beginners might consider a simple panel to affix to a window, for example. You want a project that doesn't have too many sharp edges, that doesn't have so many parts to keep track of. A simple panel for your window can be a great start!;
, You want to find a pattern that you like and that your skill level will allow you to do. Consider things like how many glass pieces the pattern will need and how much cutting and soldering you're going to have to do. If you're just starting out, again, it's best to pick a simpler pattern.


There are lots of free patterns out there: you can get them on the internet, in books from the library, and so on. The beauty of a pattern that's already available is that you don't have to figure out how it's going to work; that work has already been done for you.
Create your own pattern. You could create your pattern based on something that you saw around you, or a pattern that you saw somewhere (like in a cathedral's stained glass window) that you're trying to replicate on your own.
Look for inspiration in books and in nature. Beginners should choose a pattern that is broad and simple, such as a flower (although, be mindful of the curves and the sharp edges).

, Sheet glass is what you'll be using for this project. It falls into two basic categories: Cathedral and Opalescent. You will also need to consider things like price, texture, color, and degree of transparency.


Stained glass comes in large sheets. The smallest sheet is approximately 1 foot (0.3 m) by 1 foot (30.48 cm by 30.48 cm) with the largest being four times that size. Buy enough glass for the size of your project, but keep in mind that about a quarter of what you buy will not be utilized after trimming.
Cathedral glass tends to be a clear or transparent color. It's composed of clear glass with colorants added. This glass requires less pressure to cut through
Opalescent glass incorporates white, or opal glass, into the color mix. An opalescent blue is blue glass that is not entirely transparent, for example. Opalescent glass tends to require more pressure to cut through, because the opal of the glass creates a higher density than Cathedral glass.
You can combine these two types together in your project if you want an interesting mix of clear and opaque. Keep in mind that they need slightly differently handling (as evidenced by the pressure needed to cut through them). There is also streaky glass which tends to be Cathedral glass with streaks of opal mixed in.

, The best place to get stained glass for your project is at a stained glass supply shop. You can find both equipment for making stained glass as well as the stained glass itself. You can also get stained glass at some of the larger hobby and craft stores, but you'll get a better selection at a shop specific to stained glass.


Most of the glass you buy comes in sheets about one square foot (30 cm) and one eighth of an inch thick. The sheet can be anywhere from $6 to $20 depending on the color and the detail in the glass, the strength and brightness of the colors.
It can also depend on where the glass comes from. Glass that comes from Europe is simply going to cost more. This is often called Antique glass even if it was made in modern times.

, You'll need to gather some specific equipment for making your stained glass project. You can find these items at most hobby or craft stores, but especially at stained glass supply shops.Glass cutter: there are lots of different glass cutters available. The hand cutter has the best flexibility and accuracy in template cutting. The Pencil style cutter is great for beginners, as well as those doing trace cutting, because it has consistent pressure and control. The Pistol grip is great for cutting thick glass and is also a good choice for beginners whose hand strength isn't enough.
Pliers: ordinary house pliers shouldn't be used for this. You'll need Grozer pliers for breaking glass and nipping off edges as well as Running pliers for snapping long cuts in the glass.
Copper foil comes in a variety of widths depending on the width of your glass. This is used to hold the glass pieces together through the adhesive on the one side. If you're using Cathedral glass (clear glass) the backing will be visible so make sure you're using the right color for your piece.
Soldering iron and solder: Solder is a mixture of tin and lead. The higher the tin content, the lower the melting point, which means it will flow more quickly and with a more silvery finish. As for the soldering iron you'll need one that is designed for stained glass projects with a minimum of 75 watts. The irons come with different sized tips, depending on your project.
Grinder: if you don't have access to a grinder you can use a Carborundum stone to grind down the edges of your glass after cutting. If you can get a grinder the Electric Glass Grinder is great for dealing with sharp edges quickly.

, Draw, copy or print out your pattern on a piece of graph paper that's the actual size. Cut the pattern into its separate pieces and label them by color and grain direction. Place the pattern under the glass and trace the outline with a thin permanent marker.Leave a centimeter or less of room for the thickness of the copper foil between the pieces.
Use either a specialty black pen or a permanent marker to mark the glass.
If you have access to a lightbox this can be incredibly helpful for tracing the pattern onto the glass.

, Hold the glass cutter between your thumb and your forefinger with the tip pressed between your forefinger and your middle finger. Press the cutter into the glass gently, using a cork-backed, steel ruler to cut straight. Begin at a point away from your body and begin scraping inward.Make sure that you're applying the right amount of pressure. You should hear a nice, clear ""zzzzip"" as you score. If you apply too little pressure, the break will not follow the score line. Too much pressure and you'll cause unnecessary wear and tear on your cutter as well as your wrist and elbow.
Move your pattern around, rotating the glass as necessary to keep proper form. Make sure that the score line goes from edge to edge.

, There are a few slightly different methods to cutting your glass, depending on the size and the curve of the glass. The goal, of course, is to cut the glass along the scored lines so that it breaks apart easily and leaves you with the shapes that you need.


For straight pieces, as soon as you see a line forming, place pliers in the crack and squeeze to separate the piece. You can also hold the glass on either side of the break and snap it apart with your hands.For curved sections, use the glass cutter to break through the scoring. Don't worry if the piece breaks off slightly jagged; you can remove edges later if you need to. As long as you keep your curves gentle. If you're dealing with deep curves, deal with it in a series of shallow curves so that it won't break on its own., Once you've cut all the different pieces, it's time to grind down the sharp edges and make sure that everything is smooth. You will want to grind away gently and patiently so that you don't chip any of the pieces.


Put the pieces along the pattern again so that you can grind down the glass into corrective lines. This will make sure that everything fits well together when you put the glass pieces together.
It's also a good idea to build a frame around the pieces when you've finished grinding them and fitting them together. This way the pieces won't slip when you're foiling the glass.

, Cover the edges of the glass with 7/32 inch copper foil. Make sure the foil is centered, otherwise it can look a little funky at the end.. This can be done by hand or with a table foiler.


Once you've decided on the thickness of your copper foil, you need to peel off the protective backing of the foil. Make sure that you center your glass correctly on the tape and press it securely along all the cut edges.
Press the foil down hard with tongue depressor, or other firm instrument. This will ensure the foil adheres to the glass. You will want to make sure that the tape is very securely adhered as well as even. If a section gets bunched up, tear it off and start again.

, While flux helps the solder flow between the copper taped pieces, it isn't one hundred percent necessary. However, it can make things easier for you in the long run.


Brush each copper-foiled surface with the flux before you solder each time.
The gel form is the easiest and most forgiving to use, although you can also try out the liquid form.

, Soldering the glass takes a bit of time and patience. There are several different things you need to do to make sure you're soldering properly. You have to tack together your pieces, then you have to tin the seams, and finally you add the bead.


To tack all the pieces together apply small dots of flux to desired areas, and melt a small blob of solder on top. Once you've got all the pieces tacked together you can tin the seams.
To tin the seams you first add flux to all of the seams, then apply a thin, flat amount of solder to all of the seams. Make sure that you completely coat all of the copper foil.
Apply a new layer of flux to the tinned seams, then melt a larger amount of solder onto the seams. Run your soldering iron back and forth over to create a melted seam of solder. Once a section is completely melted you'll lift the iron up from your piece to create a smooth bead.

, Framing isn't absolutely necessary but it can create a nice finish to your piece. You could use a zinc frame or a lead channel, which requires more soldering, exactly the same as the steps outlined above.

, Especially when you're a beginner you can screw up with cutting the glass or grinding it down. This will leave you with gaps between your pieces.


Compensate for these inaccuracies by filling the gaps between your glass pieces with copper solder. Solder as you would normally.

, There are lots of things that can go wrong with scoring your glass and most of these have to do with how you're standing, how much pressure you're using, and what sort of a cutter you're using.Make sure that you're standing for long scores. This will give you better reach by utilizing your shoulder and upper body in the scoring motion. For small scores, make sure that you stay seated so you can concentrate on following the marker score line.
Use the right glass cutter. You do not want to use a five dollar cheap glass cutter as it doesn't cut clear, thin glass very well and it certainly won't cut much harder art glass. Get one that it has a carbide head, because the oil lubrication is very useful.
Make sure that you apply even pressure throughout your scoring. Remember you should hear a zipping sound as you score. Also good to remember: Opalescent glass requires more pressure, Cathedral glass requires less pressure.

, Like scoring, soldering your glass can yield some problems if you're not doing it correctly. Make sure that the heat is correct, that the tip of the soldering iron is the right size for the project, and that the flux you're using is good for higher temperatures.Using the wrong kind of flux can lead to charring, called 'black tip syndrome.’ When this happens it means that the tip of the soldering iron turns black and re-tinning becomes impossible.
Use the right size soldering iron tip. Make sure that you know what the width of the glass you're working with is and have the tip and the copper spaced accordingly.

Place fused glass on top of a mold that has received a coat of kiln-wash, and place it in the kiln.,
Fire the kiln to a temperature between 1200 to 1300°F (648.9 to 704.4°C), keeping an eye on the glass through the peephole.,
Make notes of temperature and slumping time.

,
Allow the glass to soak, which means rest, until it begins to flatten and shape itself to the mold.

,
Cool down the kiln to 1100°F (593.3°C) by either opening the lid or turning it off.,
Cool down the kiln to 1000°F (537.8°C) and maintain that temperature for 20 minutes.,
Turn the kiln off completely, and allow the piece to cool naturally.",How to Slump Glass,"


Make sure the glass piece you choose is not so big that it will flow out of the mold and pour over the sides, making it almost impossible to remove the glass from the mold.;
, The glass will begin softening and turn glossy when the temperature nears 1000°F (537.7°C) and start slumping as it nears 1200°F (648.9°C).

,,, Opening the lid allows faster cooling as the heat can escape from the kiln.

, After 20 minutes, continue lowering the temperature to 600°F (315.6°C.) This will anneal the glass which helps relieve any built-up stress.

, This can take 24 hours or more, but it is important that the glass be cooled to room temperature before you begin the final polishing to obtain your finished piece.

Rhyming greeting cards were once fashionable, but in recent years the push has been towards funny cards or cards with brief, sincere statements. Rhyming words are usually reserved for funny or crude cards.A positive aspect of the greeting card company is that it's a fairly steady business. Despite the presence of social media and the rise of e-cards, greeting cards remain a staple aspect of holidays and birthdays. The ability to sell your own greeting cards can provide you with a steady, longterm profession.Pay attention to the peaks in the market. Cards tend to sell more around holidays, but cards may also sell well during wedding seasons. Fall and summer weddings are common, so these seasons often result in increased sales.;
, Your brand is the defining aspect of your company. How do you sell your product? Are your cards sweet, sincere, heartfelt? Or are you selling that are humorous, edgy, and at times crude? Having a solid, recognizable brand type can increase your likelihood of selling your cards.


Understand the greeting card industry is incredibly competitive. Cards that are unique tend to sell better so don't be afraid to let your personality show through. Even if you feel your ideas are slightly unconventional, anything that sets you apart can help.Settle on a target audience to help determine your brand. Are you planning on selling cards for the younger generation? Are you working on cards for children, teens, adults? Make sure you choose a target audience you have a personal connection with. If you're a 20-something with no interest in children, it's probably not a great idea to try and write children's birthday cards. However, you might do a great job of selling greeting cards to young adults., Depending on how much experience you have with design and illustration, you may need to compile a team. If you have great idea, but aren't great at drawing consider reaching out to an illustrator. If you're artistically talented, but can't think of funny or interesting captions for your drawings try talking to a writer or cartoonist. Take some time to consider how big of a team you need and then gather some likeminded people., Selling greeting cards requires more than creativity and artistic talent. You also have to know how to market yourself effectively. Consider taking a business or marketing course online or at a local college. This can help you gather the necessary skills you'll need to succeed.

, Once you've decided on a brand and compiled a team, make a small batch of cards. Aim to make around 50 to 100 and see how well they sell.


The quality of your greeting cards can help them sell, so use the proper paper. Use premium paper stocks, like 16-point gloss cover or 13-point matte cover. You can find the proper paper at a local print shop.Greeting cards can be printed in a variety of sizes. For the most part, however, they're 3.5-inch by 5-inch, 4.25-inch by 6-inch, or 5-inch by 7-inch. You'll also need big enough envelops to sell alongside the cards.Keep in mind you'll probably need a special printer to print cards. You might not want to buy a printer yourself, as they can be expensive, but you can pay to use the right printer at a local print shop.Stock up on supplies in your local craft store. Glitter, glue, and other items for decoration can help your greeting cards stand out.

, At the moment, cards that look meticulously crafted and unique are in, so put some extra effort into your cards. Learn about different types of greeting cards.


Window cards are cards where the cover has sections removed so you can peak inside the card. It creates a window into a scene. These are fun, especially around the holidays. You can have Halloween, Christmas, or Thanksgiving themed window cards.Cards with scrapbook-like decorations are also in. These have a homemade feel to them that customers love. A scrapbook card is made with an assortment of decorations glued to nice paper. For example, for a birthday themed scrapbook card you could glue bits of wrapping paper, ribbon, and a stick of a birthday cake on the front of the card. Cut out the necessary letters of ""Happy Birthday"" from a local newspaper or a magazine.
More elaborate decorations are also in at the moment. These include cards with pop ups inside, cards that can be folded into different shapes, and cards with slots to place money or gift cards. Use your imagination when creating your cards.

, Are your cards going to be sweet and sincere? Or funny and sarcastic? Decide what written content to include, if any. Many people enjoy having inspirational or amusing quotes inside cards. This could help your cards sell but keep in mind you need to be careful when selecting quotations, especially if you're looking online. It's not unusual for quotes to be misattributed on sites like Quote Garden and Brainy Quote., If you're not crafty but have a great idea for a card, consult your team. Ask someone with more experience working with their hands to help you with a product. You can also take course at local community centers that go over the basics of things like scrapbooking, decorating, and drawing. This could help you gain the skills needed to make stand out greeting cards., You should test the cards out before you attempt to sell them to a big company. In fact, cards that have developed a small local following have a better likelihood of selling. Go to a local store that you're familiar with and see if the owner is willing to carry your cards for a short period of time. Tell the owner you're just interested in testing out your product to see how well they sell. If one owner says no, be persistent. Try several shops around town., Another way to get your product some attention is to set up at local craft shows. Make a batch of cards for craft shows in the area and sign up to get a booth. Pay attention to how people respond to your cards. Try to get a sense of what you're doing right and wrong in regards to your greeting cards. If, for example, many people ask if you make cards using specific colors or for specific events, try incorporating these suggestions into the next batch of cards you make., Many companies got their start by fostering a strong social media presence. If you want to make and sell greeting cards, it's important you market yourself online.


Create a Facebook page for your cards, with a fun and catchy name. Invite friends who you think would be interested. Ask them to spread the word.Share media on a regular basis. Always let your fans know when you've produced a new card and any updates on where customers can buy your cards., Once you've established a small following, start researching greeting card companies. See how you can send in ideas and what guidelines they have for submissions.


Contact various greeting card companies and see if they accept outside designs and new ideas. Many of the bigger companies, such as Hallmark, may want to stick to established providers but if you're diligent you may find a company looking for new ideas., A great way to break into the market could be going through sites like Etsy. Selling your cards online can allow you to build a small following. It's also a fairly easy and low cost platform. Many people find it easier to break into selling cards online than in a physical location.

, It's hard to break into the greeting card business. However, there are small things you can do to increase your likelihood of getting your cards picked up. Offer to provide your own fixture to display your cards. You can buy inexpensive fixtures online or at furniture stores., If you're submitting your portfolio to a bigger greeting card company, make sure you follow all their submission guidelines properly. As bigger companies get a lot of submissions, they look for excuses to ignore portfolios. Even a small mistake could get your product tossed aside., Once again, offering perks to bigger companies can increase your likelihood of selling their products. Do not require order minimums for your cards. This will entice bigger companies as it lowers risk. Companies do not have to pay for more cards than they think they will reasonably sell. Free shipping minimizes the overall cost of purchase. Keep in mind as you become established, and there's more demand for your products, you'll be able to require minimums and charge for shipping. When starting out, however, it's a good idea to offer perks., Rejection is typical in the greeting card business. It can take a very long time to get established. All you can do is take rejections with a grain of salt and keep trying. Try to keep a positive attitude and remind yourself setbacks and rejections are a key component of any success story.

, Make a lesson plan of sorts... what will you say? What order will you present it in? How will you make your presentation interesting and easy to remember?

, This will allow you to get a handle on how many people to plan for and how much you will need in the way of supplies and elbow room. This also gives you contact information for each participant so you will be able to follow up later if you want.

, If you have a large number of potential participants and space is at a premium, you could do several smaller classes instead of one larger one. On the other hand, if you have a large room, you may need some sort of public address system so that everyone can hear.

, Nothing is so small that it does not matter. Things like pins, needles, measuring tape etc. can make or break the class.

, Too few tables for too many people leads to frustration for both you and your students.

, The more thinking you do in advance, the less apologizing you will do during and after the class.

, If the group is over 5 people, you'll need assistants who can help each participant individually with their projects.

Be professional.",How to Increase Sales at Crafts Shows," Watch the customers. Keep an accurate list of what items are selling so that you can concentrate on making those for the future shows. For that matter, make a list of customers who are interested in your work. By placing a customer address book on your table, people can sign up to be placed on your email list. You can then use this list to notify them about upcoming shows.;
, Watch for hot spots on the table. Pieces placed on certain corners seem to always sell, no matter what items we placed there. The most popular hot spot seems to be the corner where the traffic first glimpses your booth. As the day progresses, you may want to rearrange your work, periodically. Usually, traffic will make their way around to your table more than once. By creating a different look, customers will get a chance to view pottery they may have missed the first time

, As pieces sell, don’t be overzealous to fill that space with another piece of work. Instead, place a “SOLD” sign in that slot. Viewers respond with a sense of urgency when they see that something they like and may buy in the future is selling.

, What is the key to eliminating the competition around you? Make verbal contact with the customers. Engage in conversations with the people that come by. Take an interest in listening to their stories. The customer's unique handmade gift choice will be treasured even more if your customer can tell the recipient that they met and got to know the artist.

, Take the cards with you to the show and only pass them out when someone specifically asks for one or when someone purchases one of your items. In this way, the chance increases that the card will be saved for future reference.

, To keep customers returning, you need to maintain professionalism in your work. Scrutinize your pieces before placing them on display. Resist the temptation to display work with defects.

Learn about Pot Melt.,
Get started.,
Create and make the opening in the base of the pot larger with a hammer and chisel or even a heavy duty screwdriver.,
Put the glass into the pot.,
Do NOT kilnwash the pot prior to the melt, this runs the risk of kilnwash particles in the resultant melt.,
Coat a tray such as the base of the terracotta pot, a kiln shelf or a square salad plate mold in 3 coats of kilnwash.,
Place the pot in the center of the kiln, making certain that the glass doesn't reach the thermocouple.,
Notice that with a round hole, the molten glass dribbles out in a spiral or circular pattern, and with a hole of rectangular shape, the dribbled glass folds on itself.

,
Ramp this project in 4 segments.,
Turn it off and leave it closed till the temp is below 175 degrees.",How to Use a Pot Melt Technique with Bullseye Glass," It is a technique where Bullseye Glass scraps or other COE 90 scraps can be used to create interesting fused glass color combinations and visual effect by mixing and melting together various colors and shades of glass in a container. Then let the resulting mixture heat so high that it “dribbles” from the opening in the base of the container to a prepared tray or kiln shelf. Due to the glass's surface tension, the glass will pour less like water and more like a syrup, this can often result in spiral or circular patterns. The process produces a colorful premixed glass disk. The random patterned disk may be used whole or sliced up then used in countless ways in glass fusing work.;
, This project uses 3 colors of Bullseye Glass: deep cobalt blue (0147), tekta clear, white opaque white (0013). 5.5 ounces of each color is used to create a 7"" diameter disk.

, The hole can be rectangular, round, or any style you like. The size does not need to be exact, or edges perfectly smooth. Keep in mind that if the hole is small, the glass will flow out very slowly. A hole over 7/8"" diameter is recommended as a minimum. In this image you can see the hole chipped away. You can also see I have used this pot before.

, You may find that experimentation is the key in the placement, as different results are produced depending on how you place the glass. Also be aware that some colors may overwhelm other colors during a pot melt. For example, avoid using too much black as it will mask other colors. As a guide, 3 lbs of Bullseye glass produces a disk approximately 11"" in diameter. We are using 1 lb to make a 7"" disk in this project.

, Of course, the pot will have some glass stuck to it, however it is possible to re use the same pot for similar colors.

, This will be where the dribbled Bullseye glass is collected. Use a piece of Bullseye Thinfire over the kilnwash. This will keep the kilnwash from sticking to the glass and requiring lots of work to remove. Easy to clean is Always more fun!

, You can coat the kiln furniture with kilnwash and also the kiln's firebrick bottom just in case of overflow or other accident.

SEG 1: 600 dph (degrees per hour) to 1700

Don't get the flower pot your using too hot too fast. If it breaks and the pot melt falls apart in your kiln you could be really sorry!
Hold the temp at 1700 for 90 minutes. This should be more than enough time to melt all the glass on to the mold below.


SEG 2: Drop the temp AFAP (as fast as possible) to 1500 and hold for 45 minutes. This will allow the glass to flow to a completely flat surface, and if some air has been trapped it will allow some time for the bubbles to rise to the surface and pop. I personally open the lid of my kiln to assist in AFAP cooling. This should be done with great care for obvious reasons. A blast of 1700 degree air can cause quite a nasty burn not to mention what a heat wave like that does to your eyes. Always wear eye protection and heat protection if you try that.
SEG 3: Drop the temp AFAP again to 960. This is the last time you will open the kiln until your pot melt is complete. I hold a project this size for 2 hours. Longer is always better at annealing temp.
SEG 4: Drop the temp 200dph to 600 degrees

, 125 is better. Your pot melt will look better in 1 piece.




Note: Be very cautious of opening a 1700F kiln and avoid if possible. Wear eye protection, shield your face, protect your hands with high temperature gloves. Synthetic clothing fabrics can be very dangerous at high temperatures, wear cotton. Synthetic fabrics can melt or burst into flames causing serious burns to your skin.

Cut the glass into the desired shape first.,
Inspect the glass for imperfections.,
Sand the cut edges smooth.,
Wash the glass.,
Heat the glass in a tempering oven.,
Quench the glass to cool it.",How to Temper Glass," This has to be done before the glass is tempered, as the tempering process will weaken the glass if it is cut or etched afterward and may increase the likelihood of breakage.;
, Cracks or bubbles may cause the glass to break during tempering; if any are found, the glass cannot be tempered.

, This removes any burrs created during cutting or etching.

, This removes any tiny grains of glass deposited during sanding, as well as any dirt that may interfere with the tempering process.

, Glass may be fed in batches or continuously. The oven reaches temperatures of over 600 degrees Celsius (1,112 degrees Fahrenheit), with the industry standard being 620 degrees Celsius (1,148 degrees Fahrenheit).

, The heated glass is subjected to seconds of high-pressure blasts of air at various angles. The rapid cooling causes the outer surfaces of the glass to cool and contract faster than the center, giving the tempered glass its strength.

, Parties can be formal demonstrations, similar to direct sale companies like Tupperware, more informal gatherings, or teaching parties. At a demonstration type of party, the guests will gather around while you show them various items and talk about each one. A more informal open house party, your craft items or handmade jewelry items are simply displayed around the room and available for sale. Another option is a teaching party, where you show participants how to make items and go through the process. Many scrap booking and stamp direct sales representatives host parties like this. Use low cost materials and simple items that are easy to make and are related to the products you plan to sell for this kind of party.

, Choose smaller items that are easy to transport and display. Be sure to have photos, brochures and order forms for items that are too large to bring to the party, and try to include smaller items that show the larger items' colors, finish and style. Consider inviting other craftspeople to sell their items at the party too.

, It's best to pick people who like to have parties, are comfortable with hosting parties and well organized.

, Go over details and explain what will happen at the party. Go over general ideas like the party theme and decorations, if applicable.

, Let them know how items can be paid for and whether you accept credit cards. Make sure the invitation has an attractive logo and graphics, and make an email version of the invitation that is just as attractive. Online invitation sites like Evite.com can make sending the invitation and tracking responses easier. Be sure to include your company website on all invitations for those who can't attend the party but are still interested in ordering products.

, Make sure you go over what is expected of the host, including what type of refreshments and seating is necessary. Be sure to reward the host with a gift.

,, Before your first party, practice by laying the items out in your own home or workspace to make sure you are prepared.

, Include incentives like free products or discounts for party hosts.

Allow the fiberglass to cure in the sun.,
Assemble the fiberglass components, if applicable.,
Clean the entire fiberglass component with a wax and grease remover.,
Sand the fiberglass using a coarse-grit sandpaper.,
Fill any low spots in the fiberglass.,
Apply primer to the fiberglass.,
Sand the finish using a fine-grit sandpaper.",How to Sand Fiberglass," If you are working with a new fiberglass component, it will have a thin layer of gelcoat on its surface. Gelcoat is an epoxy or resin-based compound that is used to line the molds when making fiberglass components. Before sanding, let the fiberglass sit out in the sun for 2 to 7 days to cure the gelcoat. This process releases any air pockets from the gelcoat that would cause problems when sanding and painting.;
, If your project consists of multiple fiberglass components (like the body, doors, and hood of a car), assemble them before sanding or finishing. This will allow you to sand continuously between each component, creating a smooth, consistent joint.

, Using this product is especially important when working with a new fiberglass component, as it is necessary to remove the release agent, the substance used to pry the component loose from its mold. Wax and grease remover can be purchased from automotive parts stores.

, For the first sanding pass, use either 80 or 100-grit sandpaper. Mount the sandpaper to a long sanding board for large, flat components. For smaller areas or areas with intricate curves, a rubber sanding block works well to follow the shape of the piece.


Never sand all the way through the gelcoat into the fiberglass itself. This causes 2 problems: it weakens the strength of the component, and it creates holes in the fiberglass that allow it to rupture through the paint later.
The gelcoat can be used as a guide during the initial sanding. Sanding the gelcoat just enough will make its appearance dull, so when the entire component has lost its shine, you have sanded enough to allow the primer or paint to adhere.

, To raise the profile of low spots in the surface, use a fiberglass glazing putty. Work the putty into the low spot, and then sand it away until the area is flush with the rest of the surface.

, Once the component has been sanded with coarse-grit sandpaper, apply the primer and allow it to set. Avoid using etching primer, as it won't adhere well to fiberglass.

, After the primer is set, sand the entire component again with a finer-grit sandpaper such as 180 or 220-grit. After this sanding, continue to apply primer or paint as desired, sanding between each application with a fine-grit sandpaper.

Purchase a multi-pack of emery cloth from a home improvement or hardware store.,
Wrap the coarse-grit cloth around a sanding block or a piece of wood to begin.,
Place the glass in your non-dominant hand.,
Work the emery cloth up around the sharp edge.,
Repeat with a medium-grit emery cloth.",How to Smooth Glass Edges1," A multi-pack has coarse to fine grit cloths, which will aid in smoothing the edges. The emery cloth is preferred over sandpaper because it is easier to run around the edges.


If you can’t find emery cloths, buy sanding blocks that are wider than the object.;
, Wear gloves to minimize contact with your hands.

, Hold it steady.

, Work for about 10 to 20 seconds on each inch, and then move along the rest of the edge.

, Then, repeat with a fine-grit emery cloth."
"
Get a sanding bit for your Dremel tool or your drill.,
Hold onto your glass object with one hand.,
Press the button to start the power tool.,
Work in toward the center and out toward the outside edge to get a rounded edge.,
Finish off with a sheet of fine grit sandpaper against the edge to get an even smoother finish.",How to Smooth Glass Edges2," Choose a medium-grit sandpaper finish. The larger the sanding bit the more of the edge it will be able to smooth at once.

, You can try placing it inside a clamp, but it is more likely to crack the edge of your glass. Only use this method if you can safely grasp the glass object without coming into contact with the sanding bit.


Be very careful when handling electric tools. Wear gloves, eye protection and a ventilation mask.

, Hold the side edge of the bit against the edge of the glass.

, Rotate it slowly until you have traveled around the entire outside edge.

After 30 seconds to one minute, pick the bottle up and look at the edge.,
Use the silicon carbide sandpaper along the outside and inside edges to create a curved, smooth edge.,
Wipe the bottle or glass with a wet paper towel along the edge.",How to Smooth Glass Edges3," You can also order sheets of sandpaper, which is useful for the outer edges. If you have several glass bottles to smooth, this is likely to be the fastest way to sand them down.


This process creates an even rim, and is less likely to make your edges crack.

, Place it on your worktable over a piece of butcher paper or newspaper.

, Spray it lightly with a spray bottle to wet it down.

, Grasp it in your dominant hand.

, Clean them out and leave them to dry overnight.

, Decide how tall you want your glass to be by adjusting the base of the cutter.

,, You should hear the blade scraping against the surface of the bottle. You should feel when the blade reconnects with the original starting point.

, Heat the scored line above the heating element. Turn the glass constantly and allow the flame to just lick the surface of the glass.

, Once you feel it is fairly hot, it is time to change the temperature on the surface of the glass.

, Move it horizontally. If the change in temperature is great enough, you should hear the glass click to indicate it is breaking along the score line.


If it does not click, return it to the heating element for a few more minutes.

, If an area of the glass is thicker, you may need to place it over the flame for a little while longer, and then apply ice across the line.

, Move gently and slowly to reduce the risk of vertical cracks and uneven edges.

, If the cut was extremely even, you can reserve it as a funnel for future craft projects.

, Pour some silicone carbide dust onto the glass. Wet it with a tsp. of water.


Silicon carbide is the dust used to make emery boards.

, Move the top of the glass in a circular motion against the silicon carbide. Do this for one to two minutes.

",How to Make a Glass from a Bottle2," Clean them and let them dry overnight.

, Keep your bowl in a ventilated area near a sink. Cover the areas where you are making glasses with a drop cloth to avoid damage from acetone, fire and glass damage.

, Tie it securely and cut the ends.

, Soak it in the acetone for at least one minute while keeping the shape of the string.

, Drop in ice cubes to make an ice bath.

, It should still fit securely. Make sure your yarn line is very level, as it will yield the top portion of your glass.

, Light the string on fire with a lighter. Let it burn for about 30 seconds until the flame burns out.

, The stress should crack the bottle across the burn line and break it fairly cleanly.


Repeat the process. With practice you should reduce the vertical cracks and unevenness of breakage.

Consider sealing the jar when you are finished.",How to Make Sea Glass Jars1," The rubbing alcohol will help get rid of any oil residue that might prevent the Mod Podge from sticking to the surface. From now on, try to avoid handling the jar on the outside as best as you can; hold the jar by the inside.;
, The most popular colors of sea glass are blue, green, and turquoise. You can also skip the food coloring to get white sea glass. There are no rules for sea glass, however, so you can use any color you want.


If you can't find Mod Podge, or any other type of decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing 3 parts white school glue with 1 part water.
Try mixing food coloring colors. 3 drops of blue food coloring and 1 drop of green will give you a nice, ocean color.
Consider adding a drop of dish soap. It will help make the glass look even more frosted., Turn the glass upside down, so the bottom of the glass is facing you. Using long, downward strokes, apply the colored Mod Podge using a flat paintbrush. You can also tap it on using a pouncer or foam brush instead.

, Be sure to let each coat dry before adding another one.The more coats you add, the more opaque your sea glass will be. It will also help conceal any streaks to a certain extent; keep in mind that there will almost always be some streaking.


Let the jar dry on a sheet of wax paper. This way, it won't stick., This will help lock the color, and prevent it from chipping off as easily. Be sure to use a matte finish. Once the sealer dries, you can turn the jar upright, and add some sealer to the top rim.

Only paint in one direction for now.If you are using a foam brush or a pouncer, gently tap the paint on instead.The foam brush/pouncer will give you a slightly-textured finish in the end.


Hold the jar by sticking you hand inside of it. If the jar is small, stick a few fingers inside of it instead.
If you are using a paintbrush, avoid going back over already-painted areas, or your paint will get streaky. You can always touch up any bare patches in later layers.

, If your home is dusty, place a box over the jar, so that nothing gets stuck to the wet paint.

, Wait for each coat to finish drying before applying the next. If you brushed the paint on, be sure to paint in opposite directions each time; this will help conceal the brushstrokes. If you used a pouncer, simply continue tapping the paint on.

, The easiest way to cure it is to let the jar sit undisturbed for 21 days. A much quicker way to cure it is to bake it. Each brand has slightly different instructions for baking the paint, so you will need to read the label on your bottle of paint."

This method will not give you perfect jars, but it is great for something quick and easy. It is also great for children.

, It might be a good idea to cut the tissue paper just a little bit bigger; it is always easier to cut something down than to add on to it.Your jar can be any color you want it to be, but white, light blue, light green, and pastel turquoise are the most popular colors for sea glass.

, Since you will be covering this layer up with tissue paper, it does not matter what finish of Mod Podge you use. If you can't find any Mod Podge, or even a similar decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing together 3 parts white school glue and 1 part water.

, A quick and easy way to do this would be to set the jar down on top of the tissue paper, and then to roll it.

, To prevent the tissue paper from wrinkling, you can cut small slits into it. This will cause the tissue paper to overlap, and lay smoothly against the jar instead.

, This will help seal the tissue paper.Make sure that you are using a matte finish, or your sea glass jar will turn out glossy.

, After this, your jar is ready to use!

This piece of wood is going to be used as a parting stop.Lay a bottle on the 2x8 piece of wood against the first piece of parting stop, and place another parting stop on the other side of the bottle. Hold that parting stop in place and take away the bottle. Then scoot the parting stop in a little bit closer to the already attached parting stop. Drill the second piece of parting stop like you did the first piece.The idea behind the jig is to hold the bottle securely, so it doesn’t roll away as you’re drilling into it.

, Drill a hold in the center of the jig base to hold the bottle stopper. You want your hole to be able 1.25 inches deep. To get the right drill hole, consider using the Forstner drill bit.You want the hole to be deep tight enough so the stopper stays still as you drill it, but loose enough so you can easily remove the bottle stopper.


This stopper will be used later to keep the string of lights secured in the bottle.

, Insert the stopper into the hole in the middle of the jig. Attach the 5/16 inch drill bit into the drill. Center the bit on the stopper, turn on the drill press, and drill through the stopper.You want to drill a hole completely through the stopper. When you are finished drilling, you will most likely have to twist off the stopper from the drill bit.


Don’t try to drill the stopper without the jig holding it in place. You will most definitely hurt yourself trying to drill it by holding it with your hands.

, Pull the stopper from the jig, and use a box knife to slice the stopper from the top of the hole to the bottom, with the point of the knife right inside the stopper hole.


The cut makes sure that once we are ready to secure the cord of lights, the lights can slide in the opening and be tightly secured by the stopper.

, Look to drill somewhere on the back of the bottle near the bottom.


Consider applying a piece of masking tape to the spot you plan to drill. The tape will help keep the drill from slipping and help to prevent the glass bottle from splintering near the drill site., Roll a piece of clay into a rope approximately 4 inches long and about ½ inch in width. Then connect the ends of the clay to form a circle. This circle will serve as a little water reservoir to lubricate the drilling hole and glass as you drill. Surround the area you decided to drill with the clay, and press it into the bottle to seal the reservoir.


You might also consider making a pocket (a thick pancake shape) of plumber’s clay, and drilling through the clay you drill. If you decide to drill this way, you must slowly pour water onto the bottle as you drill your hole so the drill doesn’t over heat the bottle and cause it to splinter and crack.

, Fill up a squeeze bottle with some cold tap water. Squirt some water into the clay water reservoir. This cold water mitigates the heat created from drilling the glass. If any water starts to leak out from the water reservoir, seal it by pushing the clay harder onto the bottle.You will have to consistently pause drilling, add water to the reservoir, and continue on with the drilling process.

, Before you start drilling, put on your protective gloves and glasses. It’s also advisable to wear long sleeve shirts when drilling glass. Use a hand drill with a ½ inch diamond bit, or glass and tile bit, to drill your hole. Place the bottle onto the jig so it stays put while you drill the hole. Hold the drill vertically straight, and start the drill. Lower the drill until it just barely comes in contact with the surface of the bottle. As you start cutting the glass, glass dust will dust up the water reservoir, making it cloudy. Continue drilling, pushing down ever so slight onto the drill.

Eventually (after about 20 or 30 seconds), the water in the reservoir will start to leak and drip into the inside of the bottle. This means that you are almost completely broken through the glass. Once you have drilled through the bottle, pull the drill out from the hole and turn off the drill..






It is very important that you don't force the drill through the glass. Too much downward pressure could make the bottle to crack.

, Look around the drill site for fractures in the bottle. If you see any cracks, you might want to discard the bottle, as it will be very fragile and potentially dangerous. Remove the clay lubricant reservoir and empty the contents of the bottle into the garbage.


If the drilled out glass disc isn’t in the bottle, it’s probably stuck in the drill bit. If that’s the case, try to pry it out with a paperclip edge.

, Use sandpaper to file down the sharp edges created by drilling the hole into the bottle. Then rinse the bottle with water to wash out any glass bits, and allow the bottle to dry again.


150 grit paper will sufficiently smooth out the rough edges of the hole.

, Remove the decoration lights from the box, and pull the lights taut so they can lay straight. Check to make sure the string of lights work by plugging them into an outlet.If the lights light up and are working correctly, insert the first bulb on the string in through the hole that you drilled out. Continue inserting the lights one by one, being sure to keep the outlet plug remaining outside the bottle. To help fit the light bulbs through the hole more easily, push the light against the cord, and push both through at the same time.


Be careful not to cut the lights cord on the edges of the hole.
You might have to turn the bottle upside down in order to move the lights inside the bottom “up” to make room for the rest of the lights entering through the base of the bottle.

, Once you’ve finished feeding the lights into the bottle, wrap the stopper around the remaining strand hanging from the outside of the bottle, and insert the stopper into the hole.The stopper will protect the cord from being cut by the raw glass edges of the hole and keep the lights inside the bottle.

, Before you can create the light source you’ll need to have an idea of the surrounding design. Is it modern or art deco or is your room design more traditional or even shabby chic?, A massive candelabra might be fun and lend for more drama but does the room size support it?

They can also bunch up around your cutting blade and make it more difficult to cut an even line. Be sure to peel labels off completely before cutting your bottle.


Soaking the bottle in warm water can help loosen the label.
Consider store bought products like Goo Gone that can dissolve the glue used to attach beer labels to the bottles.;
, The best way to cut your beer bottle is with a store bought glass cutter. You can get these online or at most craft stores. There are also cutters made specifically for cutting glass bottles.These tend to have rollers and adjustable blades that make it very easy to secure the bottle and make an even cut.

, You have two options here. You can cut the bottle closer to the top where the glass starts to curve into the spout. With this method, you will eventually glue the neck to the bottom of the bottle. You can also make the cut around the circumference of the bottle about an inch from the bottom. This way you can flip the bottle over and just glue the spout to the bottom piece which will act as the base. The second method will allow liquid to be poured into the neck which allows the goblet to hold more and also adds some character to it., Making a straight cut is difficult if the bottle is moving around. Most store bought cutters made specifically for cutting bottles will have rollers and guides to keep the bottle in place. Consider asking a friend to hold the bottle at both ends while you focus on cutting. Have your friend slowly spin the bottle as you cut so that you are working together to move around the entire bottle.


If you are cutting around the bottom of the bottle you can use a roll of duct tape as a holder. Insert the bottle into the center of the roll and grip it tight. With your free hand, position the glass cutter against the bottle. Keep the glass cutter still, using the roll of tape as a base, and start to turn the bottle until the line you are cutting meets itself on the other end.

, Again, depending on what kind of goblets you choose to make, you will either be cutting the bottle closer to the top where the glass starts to curve into the spout or around the circumference of the bottle about an inch from the bottom. You can mark this area with a magic marker or by tying a piece of string around the bottle tightly to act as a guide. You should be using some pressure to make the cut around the glass. It’s normal to hear a scraping noise and the line on the bottle should be visible as you cut.You don’t need to cut all the way through. You are just scoring the bottle at this point.
You may need to go around two or three times depending on how thick the bottle is and how deep your first cut went.

, Scoring the bottle with the glass cutter will not make a deep enough cut to completely separate the bottle into two parts. It will only weaken that part of the bottle. Spin the place you made your cut under warm water from your tap for about a minute and then rub it down with an ice cube. The change in temperature will cause the glass to contract and expand, eventually splitting the bottle cleanly where you made your cut.You may need to repeat this process a few times.
If the bottle still isn’t splitting, consider going back over your cut once more with the glass cutter, this time applying more pressure.

, Clean the bottles with soap and water in the sink. Make sure to clear away any glass powder., Get some sandpaper and work your way around the edges to smooth them out. Start by working the sand paper flat on top of the cut. Be sure to make the edges as even as possible. Once it seems even, start working the edges at an angle to round them out. Work the outside edge first and then move on to the inside edge. This will make the rim of the glasses smooth so that you won't run the risk of cutting yourself when you are drinking.


A small rotary sander can make this part go much faster. You can find them at craft and hardware stores., Wash the bottle parts one more time, making sure to get rid of any fine dust left over that might get stuck in the glue when you attach your parts., What was once the very bottom of your bottle should be facing upward. Make sure this piece sits level and doesn’t rock back and forth. This is going to be the base of your goblet so you want to make sure that you have sanded it level.If you decide to cut your bottle at the base of the neck, you’ll set that top piece down and check if it is level.

, Apply a thick layer of silicone adhesive around the lip of the bottle. Press it down onto the bottom piece, being sure there are no gaps. If you do encounter some gaps, fill them in with more of the adhesive., Hold the two parts together firmly for at least thirty seconds to give the glue time to secure the pieces together. Keep your hands as still as possible.


Some adhesives may require more time to start setting. Consult the package to be sure.

, Most silicone adhesives will cure after a few hours, but you should at least let them dry over night to be sure."

Choose a plain, straight-walled bottle.,
Remove the label and clean the bottle with rubbing alcohol.,
Slide rubber bands onto the bottle.,
Mask off whatever you don't want painted or etched, if necessary.,
Spray paint or etch the bottle.,
Wait for the medium to set.,
Remove the rubber bands.,
Use the vase.",How to Turn Empty Glass Bottles Into Vases1," You will be wrapping rubber bands around the bottle before painting/etching it to create a striped look. Plain bottles with smooth sides (no bumps or ridges) will work best for this.;
, Remove the label and any residue first. Next, wipe the entire bottle down with rubbing alcohol. This will remove any oils and residue that might prevent the paint or etching cream from adhering.

, How far up the bottle you put the rubber bands is up to you. You can cover the entire bottle with rubber bands, or just the bottom. Make sure that the rubber bands are stretched tight and flat across the bottle. If they are too loose or twisted, the paint/etching cream could get underneath them and ruin you design.You can use rubber bands that are all the same thickness, or you can use both thick and thin ones.
You can slide the rubber bands on in neat, straight lines, or you can slide them on in crisscrossing angles.

, If you will be painting or etching the entire bottle, this will not be necessary. If you only want the bottom panted/etched, then cover the rest of the bottle with masking tape., You can spray paint the bottle for a colorful look, or you can apply etching cream for a frosted look. Apply your desired medium over the entire bottle. Don't worry if you cover the rubber bands.


Apply a few light coats of spray paint rather than one thick one.Apply the etching cream in a thick layer using a foam brush., Don't remove the rubber bands just yet. If you remove them too soon, you risk ruining your design. How long the product takes set depends on what you used.


Set spray painted bottles down in a dust-free area. Wait until the paint dries, usually 20 minutes.
Allow etching cream to sit on the glass for the time recommended on the bottle. Once the time is up, rinse it off under running water., Once the bottle is dry, gently lift up the rubber bands, and cut them off one by one. If you used masking tape as well, you should peel it off.


If you painted the bottle, take extra care not to chip the paint.
If you etched the bottle, you can simple roll the rubber bands off instead of cutting them.

, Because the design is on the outside, you can fill these bottles with water. Etched bottles can be hand washed. Painted bottles should only be wiped down with a damp cloth.

Fill the bottle with silk flowers.",How to Turn Empty Glass Bottles Into Vases2," You will be coating the inside of the bottle with paint, so you want the bottle to be clear. Avoid tinted bottles as well, or the paint color won't show up properly.


If you can only find tinted bottles, consider using white paint for the inside. This will allow the bottle's color to really shine.

, Remove the label and any glue residue first. Clean the inside of the bottle with hot, soapy water. Allow the bottle to dry completely. This won't necessarily keep the paint from sticking, but it might dilute the color.

, You will only need a few squeezes of paint for this. You will be distributing the paint inside the bottle, and pouring out the excess.


Use craft grade acrylic paint—the kind that comes in a bottle. It is much more fluid than the artist grade that comes in a tube.

, Plug the bottle, either with your thumb or it's original cap/cork. Alternate between rolling the bottle across a table and tilting it upside down. Keep doing this until the paint coats the entire interior of the bottle.

, Line a baking sheet (or your counter) with newspaper or wax paper. Place a wire rack on top. Set your bottle upside down on top of the rack so that the excess paint can drain out., The excess paint will drain out in a few hours, but it can take a few days for the paint inside the bottle to actually dry. Once the paint drains out, you can stand the bottle upright to dry.You bottle may look streaky after it dries. If this happens, simply repeat the entire painting process. This will give you more even coverage., If you wish to use real flowers, insert a plastic vase liner into the bottle first.Do not fill the bottle with water, or the paint will flake away.Alternatively, you can insert a real flower into a flower tube first, then tuck it into the bottle.

, Turn the bottle upside down, and spray paint the bottom. The excess paint will fade down the sides for an ombre effect!, Draw on the bottle using hot glue, then give the bottle a few light coats of spray paint. Use acrylic paint in a darker color to add shading between the designs, if desired.

, Get a stripe of rhinestones, and wrap it around the base and top of the bottle. If you'd like to, you can paint the bottle first using spray paint.


If the rhinestones are not self-adhesive, you will need to glue them on.

, Cut down some wrapping paper to 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 centimeters). Wrap it around the bottle with a ½-inch (1-centimeter) overlap. Secure both ends of the paper with glue dots or double-sided tape.You can also use scrapbooking paper instead.
Add a thinner strip of wrapping paper on top of the first one for more contrast., Wrap the bottom portion of the bottle with burlap or twine. Secure both ends of the burlap or twine with hot glue. Embellish the bottle further with a chalkboard label, thin lace trim, or ribbon., Choose a reverse stencil where it's just the solid shape; you can also make your own by cutting a simple shape out of contact paper. Place the stencil onto the bottle, then paint the entire bottle with spray paint. Let the paint dry, then remove the stencil.

Select a bottle.,
Wrap the bottle in paper towels.,
Wrap the bottle in aluminum foil.Spread out a long sheet of aluminum foil on your working surface.,
Cut away the excess.,
Wrap the bottle in electrical tape.,
Test the thermos.",How to Make a Thermos1," Use any plastic or glass bottle with a reusable cap. The bottle should be the right size to hold an individual drink.


Under most conditions, glass is a better insulator than plastic. Plastic is cheaper and easier to work with, however, and it does have decent enough properties as an insulator to work for this project. Additionally, it is important that you use a bottle with a reusable cap, and many glass bottles do not have reusable caps.;
, Spread out a long sheet of paper towels on your working surface. Center the bottle on one end of this sheet and gradually roll it over the paper towels, wrapping the paper towels around it in the process.


Your long sheet of paper towel should consist of several individual sheets still bound together. Use enough material to cover your bottle at least three times.
To make the rolling processing easier, tape the near edge of your paper towel sheet to the bottle before you begin rolling the bottle up.
Try to keep the bottle straight as you roll it so that the paper towel wraps around the bottle in even layers.
When finished, stick a large piece of electrical tape over the open end of the paper towel to hold it down and in place.
For extra insulation, adhere disposable sanitary towels around the bottle, using electrical tape to seal the gaps between the towels.

, As you did with the paper towels, center the bottle on one end of the foil sheet and roll it over the sheet, wrapping the foil around it as you work.


Your aluminum foil sheet should be at least as long as the paper towel sheet you used, if not a bit longer.
As you begin, tape the near edge of the aluminum foil to the paper towels on your bottle to hold it in place. Doing so will make it easier for you to roll the foil over the bottle.
Continually flatten the foil over the surface of the bottle as you roll. Also make sure that you roll the bottle in a straight path so that the layers are even.
If the foil rips during the wrapping process, apply tape to the rip and continue rolling.
Tape the open end of the foil when you finish wrapping the bottle up.

, Use scissors to trim off any excess paper towel or foil sticking out beyond the top and bottom of the bottle. Make sure that enough of the material has been removed from the mouth of the bottle for you to sip from it.


As you trim away any excess, keep in mind that the paper towel layer should never be visible from beneath the foil layer.

, Stick electrical tape to the top of your bottle, starting at or just above the foil layer. Wrap the tape around the bottle in a downward spiral, bringing it all the way around the sides of the bottle and down to the very bottom.


Even though the foil may remain on the bottle without the use of tape, using tape provides an added level of security.
Black electrical tape, in particular, is the best choice because it also adds another layer of insulation to your makeshift thermos.

, The construction phase of your thermos is finished. To verify that it works, you should pour hot water into the thermos. Take the temperature of the water immediately after you pour it into the water, then check the temperature in 30-minute intervals after that.


If you are satisfied with the effectiveness of your thermos, you can use it as it currently is. If are still unsatisfied, however, try adding more layers of insulation or try a different method of construction.

Select two bottles.,
Cut off the top of the larger bottle.,
Cut the larger bottle in half.,
Coat the larger bottle with foil.Wrap aluminum foil along the inside of both bottle halves.,
Wrap the smaller bottle in cloth.,
Center the smaller bottle inside the larger one.,
Fill the gap with cotton.,
Slip the two halves of the larger bottle together.,
Wrap the outside in electrical tape.,
Test the thermos.",How to Make a Thermos2," One bottle should be able to fit into the other with no difficulty. The inner bottle can be made of glass or plastic, but the outer bottle should be made of plastic. Make sure that the inner bottle also has a reusable cap.


The outer (larger) bottle needs to be cut apart, so that is why you should use a plastic bottle instead a glass one.
Glass is a better insulator than plastic under most conditions, so if you can find a glass bottle with a reusable cap, use that for the smaller inner bottle. The cap is important, though, so use a plastic bottle with a reusable cap if you cannot find a glass one that will work.
A 1-qt (1-L) bottle and 2-qt (2-L) bottle will usually work for this project. If you are not satisfied with the size of these bottles, however, you can use two different sizes as long as the smaller bottle can fit inside the larger bottle with a little spare room along the sides.

, Use sharp scissors to carefully remove the very top of the larger bottle, cutting just below the neck. You need to leave the curved portion of the top intact.


Note that this part of the bottle is usually one of the thickest portions, so you should exercise as much caution as possible when cutting through it.
The hole needs to be just large enough for the neck of the inner (smaller) bottle to poke through it.
Consider covering the sharp cut edge with a layer of thick electrical tape to prevent yourself from accidentally getting cut as you work.

, Lay the larger bottle on its side and carefully cut it in half, leaving the bottom half just a little larger than the top half.


Cut crosswise across the bottle, not lengthwise.
Cut evenly around the bottle. Your cut should be parallel to your working surface the entire way around.
Consider covering the sharp cut edges of the top and bottom with additional electrical tape to prevent accidental cuts and scrapes.

, Extend the foil so that it folds over the sharp, cut edges of the bottle, as well.


Metal is an insulator, so covering the inside of the outer bottle with aluminum foil adds a layer of insulation. You only need a single layer of foil, though, since you will be using other insulating materials to help retain the heat throughout the contraption.

, Lay a clean cotton rag on your working surface and lay the smaller bottle on its side along one edge of the cloth. Slowly roll the bottle over the cloth, wrapping the cloth around the bottle in the process.


Note that other insulating materials could be used instead of the cloth, if desired. You could use pink fiberglass, for instance.
If you do use cloth, stick with cotton or another material that traps heat well. Avoid light, airy fabrics like chiffon, which may not provide adequate insulation.
You will likely need to tape the cloth in place to prevent it from slipping.

, Rest the bottom of the smaller bottle inside the bottom of the top bottle, centering the two together. Use hot glue from a hot glue gun to hold the two bottles together.


Let the glue dry before continuing onto the next step.

, Stuff cotton balls into any remaining gap between the two bottles. Fill the gap as high as possible, packing the cotton in snugly.


If the bottom half of your outer bottle does not completely cover the height of your inner bottle, you may need to stuff some cotton into the top half, as well. Do so as you begin piecing the halves together in the next step.
You could try other insulating materials instead of the cotton, if desired. For instance, foam beanbag beads, styrofoam packing peanuts, or polyfill insulation could all work well., Fit the the top half over the bottom half so that the two overlap. Insert the neck of the smaller bottle through the hole in your top outer half as you slide the top piece on.


If you need to add cotton to the top half of your contraption, use tweezers or a chopstick to wedge pieces of cotton into the top half, working from its larger opening, once the two halves are partially connected yet not all the way pushed together.
Since both openings are the same size, you may need to press the plastic in on the bottom half as you slide the top half over it. Be patient since this step will likely take some time and effort to complete.
If necessary, make a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slit into the top half and bottom half of the outer bottle. Doing so loosens the plastic a bit, which may make it easier for you to get the bottle halves together initially.

, Tape the bottom edge of your top outer half onto the bottom outer half. Wrap the rest of the outside in electrical tape, as well, covering all sides.


The electrical tape has three purposes:

As tape, it helps hold the structure together, preventing the halves from slipping apart with use.
As electrical tape, it has insulating properties, thereby making your thermos even more useful.
As an outer coating, it hides the “guts” of your thermos from sight, making the contraption look a little neater.



, The construction phase is complete. To check on how long the thermos will retain heat, pour hot water into it and check the temperature. Check the temperature again in 15 to 30 minute intervals.


If you are satisfied with the amount of heat your thermos retains and the amount of time it holds it, the thermos is ready to use. If not, try making another thermos using different insulating materials instead of cloth and cotton balls.

Get access to a kiln.,
Follow safety precautions.,
Protect the kiln floor and shelves.,
Insert the shelf into the kiln.,
Create a ceramic mold (optional).,
Clean the bottle and remove the label.,
Apply devitrification spray (optional).,
Add a wire hanger (optional).,
Prevent the bottles from rolling.,
Fire the kiln to 1100ºF (590ºC).,
Hold this temperature for ten minutes.,
Heat more slowly to 1300ºF (700ºC).,
Heat rapidly to about 1450ºF (790ºC).,
Flash vent the kiln to about 1000ºF (540ºC).,
Anneal the glass.,
Let the kiln cool to room temperature.",How to Flatten Glass Bottles," Glass must be heated to at about 1500ºF (815ºC) in order to lose its shape. To achieve this temperature, you'll either need to find a local ceramics studio that rents out kiln space, or purchase an electric kiln yourself.


An electric kiln often requires a new circuit, installed by an electrician. A kiln attached to the wrong voltage circuit may fail to reach the right temperatures.;
, While working around a kiln, wear kiln gloves and goggles to protect yourself. Wear a respirator mask whenever you are handling or cleaning dust or sprays from the kiln, and always operate the kiln in a ventilated room. Keep in mind that kiln interiors become much, much hotter than an oven or fireplace. Before you begin, read the operating instructions for the kiln, or ask advice from an experienced ceramicist or fused glass artist.

, If you skip this step, spilled glass fragments could damage your kiln floor or shelves during firing. There are three common materials used to prevent this, both of which should be handled while wearing a respirator mask. This protection should be reapplied whenever it starts to look uneven, peeling, or falling apart.Glass separator (recommended) or kiln wash (adequate) can be purchased in powder form and mixed to a liquid. Brush it on in at least four coats, then wait for it to dry. Make the surface as even as possible, since tiny irregularities will show up in the glass.
Alternatively, cut out kiln paper (fiber paper) to the shape of the shelf. Place it in the kiln and fire it at 1400ºF (760ºC) to blacken the paper, which can then be used as a protective surface between the glass and the shelf.

, The kiln shelf should always be raised above the floor of the kiln, to allow air to circulate between them. Place ceramic kiln posts on the kiln floor, then place the shelf on top of them. When it comes time to fire your glass bottles, they'll go on top of the shelf.

, If you prefer the bottle to form a curved taco shell shape instead of a flat tray, press the bottle into clay to form a mold.All molds should be protected by kiln wash or glass separator, as described in the kiln setup section.


Use clay intended to be fired around 1500ºF (815ºC), or it may melt during firing.

, Scrub the bottles with hot, soapy water, or leave them in a bucket of hot water and household detergent for a few hours. Scrub off any paper labels and stickers, or scrape them off using a hard plastic object.Alternatively, if you want to save and reattach a paper label, melt the adhesive using a heat gun.


Painted labels will survive the firing process, which makes a great design as long as the bottle remains still during firing.
To avoid the chance of fingerprint impressions, wear gloves and clean afterward with isopropyl alcohol.

, Also called ""devit,"" this product actually prevents devitrification, or the crystallization of glass that causes a cloudy appearance. Not all types of glass are susceptible to devitrification, and cleaning the glass helps a great deal already. Use the spray when you want to be extra careful, especially for blue and amber bottles.

, If you'd like to hang the flattened bottle afterward, shape a length of wire into a hook and place one end into the neck of the bottle. The bottle will slump closed around the wire, so there's no need to attach it yourself.High temperature wire is best. Most common wires will work, but aluminum will melt and copper and brass can leave flecks on the bottle., Place the bottles or the molds containing bottles onto your kiln shelf, lying on their side. If they are in danger of rolling, prop them up using crushed glass (frit) or small rolls of kiln paper. This will create an impression on the back of the bottle, but that's much better than having a bottle roll to the side and damage your kiln wall.


Take extra care to keep bottles with painted labels still.

, Heat the kiln at a rate of +500ºF (+275ºC) per hour, until it reaches 1100ºF (590ºC). This will just start to heat the bottles.


If you are using ceramic molds, you may want to use a slower heating rate to reduce the risk of cracking the molds.

, ""Soaking"" the glass at this temperature ensures that every part of the glass reaches the correct temperature. Pay close attention to the steps below to find out how long to keep the kiln at each temperature.

, This time, heat the kiln at a rate of no more than +250ºF (+140ºC) per hour, for a little more than an hour. At this point, the glass will just begin to lose its shape, especially in the middle. You can hold the temperature here for 20 minutes if you're aiming for a flatter, wider middle, or move on after a few minutes if you want the middle to keep more of its shape.

, Heat at a rate of +300ºF (+165ºC) per hour if using ceramic molds, or faster if not. Stay at this temperature until the bottles have slumped to the desired appearance.


This is the step that changes most, based on your bottles, kiln, and desired appearance. Consider these numbers a starting point for your first project.
Always wear eye protection while looking through a peephole. If your kiln doesn't have a window or peephole, you won't be able to check on the bottles.

, Lift the lid of the kiln — taking care to protect yourself from the heat — to cool the kiln rapidly until it reaches a temperature between 900 and 1100ºF (480 to 590ºC). The less time the bottle spends at high temperatures, the lower the chance of devitrification, or the forming of cloudy surface textures.

, Glass takes on significant stress when heated, and can crack or become brittle if it is not ""annealed"", a process in which the glass molecules are rearranged in a more stable pattern before they cool. There are two common ways to do this:


The simplest method, which is usually sufficient for bottles, is to let the kiln cool gradually, never by more than -150ºF (-80ºC) per hour. If you kiln cools faster than this, you'll need to briefly fire it occasionally to counteract the cooling.
For more effective annealing, leave the kiln at 900ºF (480ºC) for a full hour. Different types of glass have different optimal annealing temperatures, so to be extra-safe you could also leave it at 1000ºF (540ºC) and/or 800ºF (425ºC) for an hour each, starting with the highest temperature first., The bottles should have slumped flat. If you used kiln paper and the fibers stuck to the bottle, wear a respirator mask while cleaning them off the glass.

Identify a vase or glass bottle you’d like to re-purpose into your rope vase.,
Pick up sisal rope (natural color) and colored polypropylene cord.,
Dig out your hot glue gun and find your sharpest pair of scissors.",How to Make a Rope Bottle Vase1," The vase or glass bottle doesn't have to be glass or clear, as you will be covering it with rope and cord. Take into consideration the vase or bottle size as compared to the amount of rope and cord you will ultimately need.


Consider using an old soda or beer bottle as your “vase” if you don’t have a vase you can transform. Nearly any bottle that can be used to hold flowers or plants can be used for this project.;
, Depending on how you plan to design the vase you may only want a splash of cord color so determine the amount of cord as compared to rope.


Bring the vase or bottle (if possible) with you when choosing the rope and cord. This will allow you to determine the amount and style of rope and cord.

, Make sure you have plenty of glue sticks on hand for quick additions if needed.

Remove the label (optional).,
Clean the bottle.,
Dry the bottle.,
Write a message.,
Add contact information.,
Secure the message.,
Add a warning.,
Re-cork the bottle with the original top.,
Test your bottle.,
Take it to the ocean.,
Await a response.",How to Make a Message in a Bottle," Most bottles will be covered by a label and you may want to remove that label so that your message in a bottle is not mistaken for trash.To remove the label, place the bottle in hot water and let it sit for at least one hour.
The hot water will loosen the glue on the label and make it easy for you to peel the label off. You may need to scrape some of the glue off of the bottle.;
, Fill the inside of the bottle with warm soapy water and cover the opening of the bottle with your hand. Gently shake the bottle up and down for at least 30 seconds to remove any substances from the inside of the bottle. Pour out the soapy water and rinse the inside of the bottle with warm water., Once you have removed the label and cleaned the inside, place the bottle upside down in a strainer and allow it to dry. It will take about one hour for the inside of the bottle to completely dry, depending on the temperature in the room. You can also allow the inside of the bottle to dry overnight.


To dry the inside of the bottle more quickly, place it in the oven on low heat at 150 °F (65.6 °C) for approximately 25 to 30 minutes. Be cautious when removing the bottle from the oven and allow it to cool off before continuing with the process. Another alternative for drying the inside of the bottle is rolling up a paper towel lengthwise and placing it inside of the bottle. Be sure to leave a portion of the paper towel on the outside of the bottle so that it can be easily removed.

, Start writing your message while the bottle is drying. You can write a story about your life, a poem, or an encouraging message. The possibilities are endless and you should write whatever you want to share, as long as the message is positive.


Since it is highly likely that a stranger will read the message, be sure not to reveal sensitive personal information. For instance, do not include your age or phone number if you are under the age of eighteen.
You can add things that you enjoy, such as your favorite sport or your favorite food.
Once you have finished writing your message, read it to determine if it is truly what you want to share with a stranger. They may contact you years down the road, so be sure to share something interesting.
Some people send a message in a bottle for sentimental purposes, such as sharing a love story., Instead of using your address, use a Post Office Box number. You can also use an email address if you have an email address that you feel comfortable sharing with strangers. This allows the recipient to track you down and tell you where they found your message in a bottle.

, Roll up your message as tightly as possible and place a small piece of tape around it to keep it from unraveling. Be sure that the tape will not destroy the message when the recipient unrolls the message. Drop your message into the bottle after the bottle is dry and make sure the entire piece of paper fits in the bottle.

, Use a permanent marker to write a warning on the outside of the bottle, such as: ""Do not throw this bottle away - message inside!"" Make sure that the words are clearly visible.

, You can improvise with an insoluble material and waterproof glue. The goal is to prevent water from seeping into the bottle and destroying the message.


Pour melted wax onto the cork before placing it back onto the bottle for a much stronger seal that is more likely to endure water and temperature changes. , To make sure that your bottle is buoyant and floats, drop your bottle into a bathtub and make sure that it does not sink to the bottom. No one will receive your bottle if it sinks to the bottom of the ocean.


If it does not float, you will need to find another bottle.

, The goal is to simply place your bottle in the ocean and hope that it reaches a far away destination.


Check the litter rules. Verify that the rules in your county do not prohibit you from sending a message in a bottle., Now that you have sent your bottle off into the world, all you have to do is wait. Do not expect to hear from someone that day, the following week, or the following month. It could take many months, even many years for someone to receive your message.


Be patient and do not get discouraged if you do not receive a response because it could still happen years down the road.
It has been reported that bottles from the titanic survived at sea for over a century.

, For a more rugged appearance, rocks, stones or pebbles provide an authentic country house or farmhouse theme. Choose ones with interesting shapes, textures and colors.

, Before you add your flowering flourish, consider enhancing the bottle with separate petals or greenery.


Consider using silk or artificial flowers/petals/stems instead of real plants if you plan to use the bottle centerpiece for more than one evening.

, Another way to add interest is to drop chunks of lemon, mango or even small pieces of broccoli inside the bottle., Red Hots or any other small hard candies would suffice.


To match a holiday theme, one example would be to drop broken candy canes inside the bottle for a festive touch.

Purchasing enough bottles to decorate a bottle tree can be very expensive, so try to reuse as many as you can. You can even make a recycling drive for old glass bottles.;
, In the folklore associated with bottle trees, blue is the best color for deterring spirits. Sky vodka bottles can be combined with almost any other color of bottle for a multi-colored bottle tree., Unless you want to advertise your favorite drink, you can remove the labels by soaking them in a mixture of vinegar and water. Remove stubborn labels with Goo Gone, or a similar orange cleaner. The place where the label was may be sticky so you should clean it thoroughly until the glue is completely gone.

, Traditionally, bottles were placed over the dead branches of a tree; however, your landscaping will determine if this is possible, or if you need to make a metal tree.

, Garden bottle trees that hold between 10 and 30 bottles are available on Amazon and eBay for $20 to $100.

, If you want a statement piece, then investing in an elaborate design will make sense. If you don’t want to spend upwards of $500, opt to make it yourself.

, Dig a hole in your yard and pour a concrete base. Insert the post into the ground and allow it to dry.


Screw holes around each side of the tree intermittently. Use a drill at a downward angle, ensuring you extend each hole at least three inches (7.5cm) inward.
Insert metal rods of six inches to one and a half feet (0.2 to 0.5m).
You can purchase metal reinforcing rods at a home or hardware store.
Make sure each of these rods is secure before continuing to the next one.

, Recently, this has become a very popular choice because of its durability in all climates.Purchase 10 to 20 lengths of rebar from a construction recycling yard, a steel business or a large hardware store. The rebar should be 3/8-inch to ½-inch (1 to 1.3cm) rebar. They can be at different lengths to mimic branches.


Purchase a metal collar in which you can encircle your rebar branches or plan to weld the rebar together.
Rent a conduit bender if you want to bend the rebar dramatically.
Drive stakes into the holes where the rebar will go. Then, drive the rebar into the ground with a stake hammer.
Weld your rebar together if you want to. Check that it is sturdy before decorating it.

, It should meet the bottom of the bottle to avoid blowing off in the wind.

, Add a bottle on each side to offset the weight of the bottles.

, You may need to cement the tree into place if the ground is not very compact.

, You can also train vines to grow up the center section of your tree.


If you want to create a cobalt blue bottle tree, but you don’t have enough blue bottles, start with easier to find green or brown bottles. Then, collect and replace them throughout the years.

Position the vinyl on the glass.,
Mix your etching cream, if necessary, and apply it.,
Remove the cream and allow the glass to air dry.,
Peel away the vinyl and enjoy your etched glass.",How to Etch Your Glass Water Bottle1," You can find most etching creams at craft and hobby stores, though you may also be able to find these at your local hardware store. The other supplies you'll need are either household items or available at most grocery or craft stores. For this project, you'll need:


Adhesive vinyl
Clean rag (or paper towel)
Drop cloth
Glass etching cream
Goggles
Paint brush or sponge brush
Pencil or pen
Plastic gloves
Tracing paper (optional)
Utility knife;
, You'll want a flat, sturdy surface to work on while etching. Beyond that, you might want to put down a drop cloth. This will prevent any dripped or spattered etching cream from damaging your work surface or the surrounding area. Then clean your glass with mild soap, rinse it with water, and air dry it.


Bottles with resistant dirt or grime might need some rubbing alcohol and a good scrub. Afterwards, clean your glass with mild soap, rinse it with water, and air dry it.
Glue left on your bottle may negatively affect the etching process. You may need to soak your bottle in hot soapy water overnight to break up and remove this.
Fingerprints, oil, and dust can also hurt the outcome of your etching. While cleaning and afterward, you may want to wear glove to prevent new fingerprints., You might first want to hold your vinyl up to your water bottle to see where would be best to draw your design. Make sure that all your designs form closed shapes.


While first getting the hang of etching, you may want to stick to simple designs and shapes.
The area on the inside of the closed shapes will be the etched part of your bottle. Keep this in mind while drawing your designs.
If you're not very artistic, you can use tracing paper, trace your design, and transfer it to your vinyl.

, Take your utility knife and very carefully cut only your design free from the vinyl. You should not cut the vinyl from the side, but should press your utility knife into the outer lines of your design to cut the inside parts away.









At this point, you should have one large piece of vinyl with holes in it from where you cut out your design.
The excess vinyl you cut free while cutting out your designs can be thrown away or reused later.
Be careful when cutting your designs. It's easy to press too hard with your knife and cut into your work surface. For this reason, you may want to use a cutting mat., Be careful at this point not to get any fingerprints, smudges, or dirt on your glass. Take the adhesive vinyl with the designs cut from it and pull free the adhesive backing. Position the design on the glass, and press the vinyl in place.If you have a large piece of vinyl, you may have flaps sticking above or below the top and bottom of your bottle. These can be cut off.
Try to remove bubbles in your vinyl at the boundaries of your design. These can create places the etching cream can sneak in, causing your design to be imprecise.

, Depending on the kind of cream you purchased, the usage instructions will vary. In most cases, a small amount of cream can be put into a plastic container or directly onto the glass. Then spread the cream over the glass uncovered by your vinyl with a paintbrush or sponge brush.









As a general rule, whenever handling chemicals you should wear gloves and goggles to prevent irritation, sickness, or permanent injury.
Some kinds of cream may be too strong and require a diluting agent, like distilled water, to be added.
Always read and follow the directions of your etching cream. Chemicals can be very dangerous if not handled properly., If etching cream has special, post-application handling instructions, follow these carefully. Generally, you should be able to remove and neutralize cream by rinsing it away under running water, then allow the bottle to air dry.









Depending on the etching cream, the ideal time you should leave the cream on the glass will vary. Consult your label for the best results, but for most creams, 15 minutes should be enough.
If it is inconvenient to run your glass under running water, in many cases you can remove etching cream by wiping it away with a damp rag. Wear gloves when doing so.
Leftover etching cream should be disposed in the way indicated on the label of your product. Often, this involves diluting the cream with plenty of water and rinsing it down the drain., You may need to use the edge of your utility knife to lift a corner of your vinyl, but once you do, it should be easy to peel it off the glass with your fingers. Now you can show off your etched glass water bottle to your friends!









In some cases, the adhesive from your vinyl may have left glue behind on your bottle. This can often be removed with mild soap, warm water, and a scrub brush.
Stubborn glue might require an overnight soak in soapy water before it comes loose."

Select your resist.,
Gather your other abrasive etching materials.,
Prepare your work area and glass.,
Make a stencil of your design on your resist.,
Cut your design free.,
Adhere your resist to your glass.,
Check safety equipment before etching.,
Sandblast until the design is sufficiently etched.,
Clean the bottle.,
Remove the resist and enjoy your etched bottle.",How to Etch Your Glass Water Bottle2," The resist is a cover that will protect part of your glass bottle while uncovered parts get etched by a sandblaster. Whatever material you choose as a resist, it should be sturdy and able to stand up to sandblasting without peeling away.


Two common kinds of resist that you might use in your abrasive etching include sturdy varieties of contact paper and strong vinyl adhesive tapes/sheeting.
The key requirement when choosing a resist for sandblasting is a strong adhesive. If your resist peels away while blasting, your design will be ruined., In addition to your resist, you'll also need a handheld sandblaster and some safety gear. Sandblasting releases small bits of sand at a high speed to wear away surfaces quickly. This can cause irritation or damage to the skin, lungs, and eyes without the proper equipment. You'll need:


Clamps (optional)
Drop cloth
Gloves
Googles
Pen or pencil
Respirator mask
Sandblaster/glass etcher, You should only operate your sandblaster in a well ventilated, wide open area or sandblasting cabinet.While blasting, surrounding objects may be effected, so make sure all unnecessary equipment and items are moved away and/or covered with a drop cloth. Then clean your bottle with mild soap, water, and air dry it.The process of abrasive etching erodes the outer layer of the glass with tiny particles of sand sprayed at high speeds. Because this is a physical process, you don't need to worry as much about fingerprints as you would with chemical etching.

, Take a suitable pen or pencil and draw your design on on your resist. Be sure that all parts of your design form closed shapes. Simple designs might be the best option for beginners.Holding your vinyl up to your glass can give you a better idea of the best size and placement for your design on the resist.
If you aren't very artistic, you can copy a professional looking design with some tracing paper and transfer that to your resist.

, Take your utility knife and press it into the outer lines that you drew on your resist to cut away the inner parts of your design. Avoid cutting from the edges, as this can create gaps where the sandblasting etches the glass where you had not intended.


Exercise caution when cutting. Your utility knife might press through the resist and make cuts in your work surface. To prevent this, you can use a cutting mat.
At this point, your resist should be in one piece, with holes where you've cut free your design.
Unused pieces of your resist can be thrown away, though you may be able to reuse these in other projects., Depending on the kind of resist you've chosen, this process may vary. In many cases, your resist can be applied by removing its adhesive backing and applying it to your water bottle.


Smooth bubbles and irregularities in your resist especially around its edges. These areas are susceptible to being pulled loose during abrasive etching., Proper safety equipment is a must when abrasive etching. Little bits of sand or glass can get in your eyes or lungs, causing serious discomfort or permanent injury.Make sure that:


Your gloves are without holes and fit your hands well. Gloves that don't fit well may make it difficult to operate your sandblaster.
Your respirator is comfortable and properly fastened, with no spaces between it and your face.
Your goggles are comfortably, firmly attached to your head and allow you unobstructed visibility.

, Depending on the weight of your water bottle and the power of your sandblaster, you may need to clamp it in place or use a sandblasting cabinet.Generally, the longer you sandblast, the more etched the glass will become, though sandblasting too much may cause the glass to weaken or break.


When using a clamp to hold your bottle in place, keep in mind that the parts of your glass covered by the clamp will not be etched.
If a sand blasting cabinet or clamp are inconvenient, you could use objects you don't mind blasting with sand, like cinder blocks or a cement wall, to support your bottle.Avoid holding your sandblaster on an angle while blasting. Working on an angle has a much greater chance of lifting the resist and spoiling your design.
There are many different kinds of sandblaster. Always follow the directions on your equipment for the best results, and avoid holding the blaster too close to the glass.

, Glass dust and sand will be on the surface of your bottle, so you should handle it with gloves until you've rinsed it thoroughly under warm water. If there isn't a suitable faucet around, thoroughly wipe the glass with a clean, damp cotton rag.


Glass dust and sand can build up on your rag when wiping it clean. As your rag dirties, switch to a clean part and continue until the whole glass has been wiped., Since the adhesive of most abrasive resists needs to be strong to stand up to blasting, you may have some difficulty removing it. A brief soak in soapy water can loosen this adhesive. Then pull the resist free and enjoy your handiwork.In some cases, you may be able to use the tip of your utility knife to lift a corner of the resist and pull the rest free.

A resist is covering that will prevent the acid from etching your glass, so by applying it to your bottle artistically, you can form patterns of etched glass in the places you didn't use your resist. In all, you'll need:


Apron
Bamboo skewer
Clean rag (or paper towel)
Cotton wool
Distilled water
Glass water bottle
Hydrofluoric acid
Magnesium hydroxide
Plastic container (x2; thick, sturdy plastic preferred)
Protective goggles
Resist (wax, adhesive vinyl, or bitumen)
Rubber gloves
Tongs
Utility or craft knifeDepending on your country and local laws, hydrofluoric acid may only be available from specialized chemical companies. This substance can be very dangerous if improperly handled.

, There are many different kinds of resist you can use in your acid etching, and each will yield a different effect. The three most common resists when etching glass are adhesive vinyl, bitumen, and wax. Of these three resists:



Adhesive vinyl is best suited for creating sharp lines and shapes. You can easily use this resist to create linear and precise designs.

Bitumen is generally sponged or painted onto the surface of your glass. It creates an etched effect that has a painted appearance.

Wax allows some of the acid to creep under its edges. This creates soft, free lines in your etching.

A wax mixture you might try on your own: combine equal parts beeswax, tallow, and paraffin wax., Choose a flat, level, sturdy work surface equipped with a fume hood.Hydrofluoric acid is very dangerous, and should be treated with extreme caution. Then, you'll need to clean your water bottle. Dirt, grime, and oil on the surface of your bottle can hurt the end result of your etching.


For light to moderately dirty bottles, simply rinse it in warm water with a mild soap. Then wipe off excess moisture with a clean rag or paper towel and allow it to air dry.
Dirty bottles might first need to be doused and wiped with rubbing alcohol. Then rinse the glass with mild soap and warm water and allow it to air dry.
To prevent accidentally leaving behind fingerprints after cleaning your bottle, you may want to wear your gloves from this point on.

, Depending on the kind of resist, your method of application will vary. Wherever you apply your resist will not be etched by the acid you'll be putting on your glass. In this way, you can form designs by leaving gaps in your resist application to form etched shapes, designs, and patterns.


You can draw or trace and transfer closed shaped designs on adhesive vinyl beforehand. Then, cut these out with a utility knife to create gaps in the vinyl where the acid will etch, pull free the adhesive backing, and apply the vinyl.
Wax can sometimes harden very quickly when it comes in contact with your glass. You can give yourself more time to work with the wax by warming your glass first, like you could under a lightbox, for example., A dibbler is a kind of applicator that you can use to put your acid onto your glass water bottle. To make your own dibbler, all you need to do is tie clean cotton wool to a bamboo skewer firmly.


In some cases, your acid may have come with an applicator. Feel free to use this in place of a dibbler.
You may be able to create a sufficient dibbler by folding your cotton wool in half and skewering it on the pointed end of your bamboo skewer., Acid can be very dangerous, so you should always use extreme caution when handling it. However, hydrofluoric acid can be neutralized with a magnesium hydroxide heavily diluted with distilled water.



Never attempt to neutralize hydrofluoric acid with potassium carbonate (soda ash), potassium hydroxide, or sodium hydroxide. These create a dangerous reaction with hydrofluoric acid.Magnesium hydroxide can be found in many over the counter supplements at your local pharmacy or drug store., Always follow the usage directions that came with your acid, but generally you can expect an ideal hydrofluoric acid solution for etching to be in a 3:1 ratio. This means for every three parts acid, you add one part distilled water.


For example, since you're only etching a water bottle, it isn't likely you'll need much solution. In this case, you might only use 1 cup of acid diluted with 1/3 cup distilled water.
Prioritize plastic containers that are sturdy and safe to use with your acid. Otherwise, the corrosive effect of the acid may eat through the container., With your hands still gloved, eyes goggled, and while under the fume hood, take your dibbler by the end opposite the one that has the cotton wool attached.Lower your dibbler into the acid until the cotton wool is submerged. Then:


Remove the dibbler and allow excess acid to drip back into the acid filled container. When the dripping ceases, apply a thin film of acid to the glass with the dibbler.
Reinsert your dibbler into the acid as necessary and cover all surfaces on your bottle that don't have a resist coating., After waiting some time, take your bottle and dip it in your neutralizing solution. Alternatively, you could use a brush to paint liberal amounts of neutralizer onto where you've applied acid to your glass, or you could dribble neutralizer onto your bottle with a spoon or ladle.


Once the acid on your bottle has been neutralized, rinse the bottle with water and allow it to air dry.
The acid will begin etching immediately after its application. Waiting only a short time will result in light etching, longer wait times in prominent etching., Generally, the company you bought your hydrofluoric acid from will also indicate the best disposal practices for your region. Generally, all used/wasted hydrofluoric acid should be:


Placed in a chemically compatible container that won't be eaten away by the acid over time. It should be clearly labeled with a Hazardous Waste tag.
Taken to an approved, local hazardous waste disposal site. These can often be found with an online keyword search for, ""hazardous waste disposal near me."""

Glow-in-the-dark paint
Paint brush
Paint pallet or paper plate
Rubbing alcohol;
, It would be a good idea to do this, even if the jar looks clean. Any dust or dirt that's on the jar will prevent the paint from sticking. Be sure to scrub off any labels and glue residue.

, Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol and wipe down the jar. Be sure to get both the inside and the outside. This will get rid of any residue and oils that the soap missed.

, You can use any color of glow-in-the-dark paint, but colors such as yellow and orange might look more like stars than purple and green. Glow-in-the-dark paint usually comes in two different forms: liquid paint and puff paint. Liquid glow-in-the-dark paint is just like any acrylic paint and needs to be put in with a paintbrush. Puff paint comes in a bottle with a pointy tip. You can draw with it straight from the bottle.


You can find puff paint in the t-shirt and fabric paint section of an arts and crafts store. It may also be labeled as ""3D paint"" or ""dimensional paint."" It has a slightly raised surface when it dries.

, It will be easier to dip your paintbrush into a little puddle of paint than into a bottle of paint. Do not pour out too much paint at one time. Most acrylic paints dry quickly. If you pour out too much paint, it may dry up before you finish using it.


If you are using puff paint, you don't need to do this, because you can apply the paint straight from the bottle.

, You can paint inside the jar or outside the jar. Painting on the outside will be easier, but the paint will be more likely to get scratched off. Painting on the inside will be harder, but the paint will last longer.


If you are using puff paint, simply take the cap off, and start making little dots all over the jar.

, This will make your jar resemble the night sky even more. Look up some of your favorite constellations, and try to copy the pattern onto the jar. Orion, the Big Dipper, and the Little Dipper are popular ones.

, Most paints should dry within two hours, but some paints (such as puff paints) may take longer. Read the label for more specific drying times. Once the paint is dry, you can put the lid back on. This is not necessary, since there is nothing inside the jar that can fall out.


The sunlight will also activate the glowing particles in the paint.

, If the jar does not glow, you might need to leave it under a bright light for a little longer. Most glow-in-the-dark paints need to sit under a bright light for at least two hours."

, Wash your jar with soap and warm water, and scrub off any sticky residue using cooking oil and a scouring pad. Wash the jar again with more soap and water, and wipe it down with rubbing alcohol when you are done.

, If you can't find glitter glue, use clear glue instead and add some super fine glitter. The more glitter you add, the more sparkly your jar will be.


Great colors include blue, purple, and silver. You can even add in some star-shaped glitter, if you want.
It doesn't matter what color you use, but some colors will work better for a night sky than others, such as silver, blue, or purple.

, Try to match the paint color to the glitter glue color. If you mix opposite colors together (such as blue and yellow) you may get a different color that does not look like the night sky at all. Great colors include blue and purple.

, You can use clear hair gel, or tinted hair gel. If you are using tinted hair gel, try to use ""night"" colors such as purple or blue.

, They are the same type that you stick onto your ceiling at night. Some sets also include planets. If you can't find any, try using some star-shaped glitter or glow-in-the-dark glitter instead.

, You can also put super glue around the entire rim of the jar before you put the lid on. This will prevent kids from opening the jar and spilling everything inside.

, The stars should move slowly through the gel when you shake it. If they don't move at all, the gel might be too thick. Try adding a few tablespoons of water, closing the jar, and shaking it. This will thin out the gel a little, and let everything swirl inside easier., Some paints will become activated in as little as 15 minutes while others will need up to 2 hours. Once the time is up, take the jar into a dark room and watch the stars glow. If the jar doesn't glow, leave it under the bright light for a little longer.

, Wash it with some soap and water, and peel off the label. If there is any sticky residue, you can scrub it off using some cooking oil and a scouring pad. Be sure to wash the oil off with more soap and water. Wipe the jar down with some rubbing alcohol when you are done.

, Fill a cup with ½ cup (120 milliliters) of water. Add a few drops of glow-in-the-dark paint. Stir the water with a spoon until the paint is mixed in and there are no streaks. The more paint you add, the brighter your jar will be. The less paint you add, the lighter it will be. Repeat this step with a new cup for each color of paint that you are using.

, Gently unroll each cotton ball and fluff it up a little. You don't want it to be shaped like a ball.

, How thick you make the layer will depend on how many colors of paint you are using, and how many rows of color you want. Here are some guidelines to get you started:


If you are using 3 different colors, fill the jar 1/3 of the way with cotton balls.
If you are using 4 different colors, fill the jar ¼ of the way with cotton balls.

, You can use whatever color of glitter you want, but gold or silver will look the most real. You can also sprinkle in some star-shaped glitter as well for a more realistic effect.

, Stop when the paint water reaches the top of the cotton balls. If you need to, tap down on the cotton balls with a wooden stick or spoon. You want them to be just under the water. Don't worry if the glitter floats to the top of the water.

, Keep repeating these steps until you have used all your colors and the jar is full.

, Tap the cotton balls with the stick. You can even slide the stick between the cotton balls and the glass wall of the jar. You don't have to do this, but it will help blend the colors together.

, If you are going to be giving this to a small child, you may want to put super glue around the rim of the jar first, so that he or she doesn't open the jar and spill everything.

, If the paint is not glowing, you will need to leave it under a bright light for a bit longer.

Most glow sticks will only glow for a few hours, so plan on making this jar just before you want to use it. The best time to see this jar glow is at night, when everything is dark. Here's a list of what you'll need:


Mason jar
Latex or vinyl gloves (recommended)
Scissors or craft knife
Strainer
Glow sticks
Tulle or water beads (optional)
Glitter

, This project can get a little messy, so it might be a good idea to cover your table or counter with several sheets of newspaper. You could also try working over a sink or outside.

, Wash your mason jar with soap and warm water and let it dry. If there are any labels, try peeling them off. You can remove the label residue by covering it with some cooking oil and scrubbing it with a scouring pad. Be sure to clean the oil off with some soap and water, and to wipe the area down with some rubbing alcohol.

, Glow sticks have glass tubes inside of them. When you activate a glow stick, the glass tube will shatter. The strainer will catch the glass shards.


Don't use this strainer for cooking again. Even if you clean it well, there may still be tiny bits of glass caught in it.

, You can use any color of glow stick you want, but some colors, such as blue, purple, and white, might look more like a night sky than others.

, This will help protect your skin against the chemicals. It will also protect you from the glass shards inside the glow stick.

, Try cutting the glow stick over the jar, so that you don't spill and waste any of the liquid inside. If you are a child, ask an adult to help you with this step.

, Turn the glow stick upside down and jiggle it until all the liquid pours into the jar. You may need flick your fingernail against it to get all the liquid out.


You will need about three bracelet sized glow sticks per jar.If you are using regular glow sticks, you will only need one.

, Toss the shards into the trash, and rinse the strainer out well. Don't use the strainer for cooking again. If you are wearing gloves, pull them off by the cuff. They will flip inside out as you tug down on them. Throw the gloves away too.

, How much glitter you use will depend on how sparkly you want the jar to be. Plan on using one to two teaspoons. You can also add some other fillers, such as a piece of tulle to help suspend the glitter, or water beads to resemble planets.


You can find the water beads in the floral department of an arts and crafts store. They are about the same size as marbles, and gel-like.

, This will help mix everything together.

, The glow sticks will only last for a few hours. If you want to reuse this jar, you will need to add more glow stick liquid.

Finished.

",How to Bedazzle a Bottle of Alcohol," Take into account the shape of the bottle and the color of the glass. In many cases the bottle itself has been molded to include a brand name––in this case, either work with the brand name if it's top end alcohol, or be prepared to hide it ingeniously if it's something you're trying to cover up! If you're going to make a whole row of bedazzled bottles for a party bar, choose bottles that will match nicely together. They don't have to be uniform but they should have visual interest.


Bear in mind that some bottles might be harder to work with than others. For example, bottles using frosted glass or weird edgy design features might make it harder to attach bedazzling items.

, You'll want a blank canvas to work with, so all labels, front and back, and anywhere else, will need to be taken off. The method you'll use for removal will depend on the label type and how it has been attached, while in some cases where the label forms part of the glass bottle, you'll have to let it be. Soak the bottle in soapy water to help detach glued-on labels and use an item such as a paint scraper to scrape away the paper and glue remnants. For stubborn glue remnants and pieces of label, use an oil such as eucalyptus oil, or a commercial goo-remover to give the needed muscle to get the sticky stuff off.


While removing the labels, be sure to clean the entire surface of each bottle so that the adornments you're adding will adhere properly. Finish by wiping over with a soft cloth dampened with vinegar.
Check the bottle lids to ensure they're secure. Don't use anything with a loose lid or you could end up awash in vodka, rum or gin as you glue away!
Be sure you either allow the bottle to air dry or use a clean towel to dry it off.

, Since the design is heavily dependent on the materials used, consider what you'd like to use with the bottles first. You can always add more features after designing the bottle. Obviously, you're unlikely to be gluing in place real gems but faux jewels will look fantastic. On the whole, use objects that sparkle, can be glued into place with ease and that add vibrancy to the bottle. Some things that might work include:


Sparkling costume or faux jewels––don't be afraid to pull apart old pieces of costume jewelry, much of which can be sourced from thrift stores or online sales.
Sticky faux jewels, rhinestones and the like––usually available from craft shops, these will self-adhere to a clean bottle.
Feathers––brightly colored feathers from a craft store can be fun additions to the bottle.
Glitter––all colors of glitter will be appropriate for bedazzling the bottle. Check that liquid glitters will adhere properly to the glass before purchasing.
Three dimensional letters––perhaps you want to include the name of a birthday guest, retiree, or some other special person; three dimensional lettering would look super on the bottle. In fact, if you want to label the bottles (“vodka, gin, rum” etc.), you may find fancy three dimensional letters make a nifty labeling system.
Shells. Easily gathered from craft stores or the beach, shells and sparkly pieces of shell (such as paua/abalone shell) could really beautify a bottle.
Beads. Although some beads might be a bit hard to attach, they might be worth the effort if they really help the design to pop. Anything larger than a seed bead is probably best, so that it's easy to see and easy to handle too.
Charms. Any sort of charm will probably add bling to the bottle. Try to match the colors (gold, silver, etc.) with the other color themes you're using the bottle.
Paint. Don't neglect the possibilities of paint, including shiny paint, glitter paint and glow-in-the-dark paint. The addition of some funky paint could be done as part of the design or as the entire design. Another approach is painting the entire bottle, then gluing the gems and other decorations onto the painted background. This can be quite an effective look.
Bits and bobs from your craft basket––anything shiny, glittery, sparkly or brightly colored is a possibility for a bedazzled bottle, from sequins to ribbons. Just as long as it fits the theme you're looking for and can be glued or somehow well attached to the bottle, then you're all set.
Match the adhesive to the materials chosen. If you aren't sure, ask for advice from the craft or hardware store where you're purchasing the glue from. In many cases, a hot glue gun or a craft glue will suffice but this may not always work, so check first.

, How you want to bedazzle the bottle is an entirely personal creative exercise. It will also depend on the shape of the bottle, the theme of your party or event and what materials you've decided to use. Draw a basic design of the bottle on paper and play around with some of the materials to place them in different ways. There are many possible combinations but some of the things that might work for your bottles include:


Rings of gems or faux jewels around the bottle. For example, you might have a series of rings cascading down the bottle and nothing else. Or, you could have three evenly spaced rings, with large feature pieces adhered in between each ring as a focal piece.
A centerpiece in the mid-center of the bottle's front. This could be anything from a cameo with the birthday person's face in it to a bunch of flowers made purely from gems.
A ribbon tied around the neck and glued down onto the front of the bottle, with small bows stuck randomly around the bottle and gleaming gems stuck into the center of each bow.
Random distribution of faux jewels and shiny pieces, so that it looks as if it's dripping with sumptuous treasures.
Party themed. Perhaps your party has a theme. In this case, try to target the design to the theme, such as a treasure hoard bottle for a pirate themed party or a diamond encrusted bottle for a whodunnit party featuring wealthy elites as characters. Whatever the theme, you'll be able to think of relevant bedazzling additions.
Decide whether you'll bedazzle other objects, such as glasses and the table décor. If this is the case, avoid overwhelming the entire look by making the bottles appear too complicated or at odds with the other designs.

, Use poster tack rather than glue to put all of the elements in place to see if they work. The beauty of doing this is that you can move around everything to your heart's content until it ""clicks"". Then take a digital photo and print off a copy or place it on a tablet that you can have next to you as the template while you work on the actual design.


Pick up the bottle. Is it easy to handle with the chosen design or do you find it hard to grip the bottle? Remember that someone still has to handle the bottle safely, without slips.

, Once you're happy with the design, start adhering the bejeweled pieces to the bottle following your design. Work on a covered workspace to prevent splashes and staining and use bowls and other small containers to hold all of the gems, glitter and charms so that they're not lost as you work through the creation. Have tweezers and rags at the ready to help with handling the gems, etc. and to clear away glue and paint spots. Some hints to help things run smoothly when creating the bottle:


Sometimes it's easier to work with the bottle on its side rather than standing upright. If you do keep the bottle upright, work from top of the bottle to the bottom. That way, your hand won’t be constantly bumping or smudging previous work. Be sure you turn the bottle around so you reach all angles and areas before moving downward.
If an item starts to slide off the bottle after adhering it, use toothpicks, bamboo skewers, etc. to act as props to keep the item in place until it dries. As it dries, you'll need to leave the bottle alone to prevent any other additional movement. Perhaps move onto the next bottle while you wait.
If using paint, it's a good idea to attach all the painted items before anything else. That way you'll avoid painting more than the glass and if you don't like the paint effect in any part, you'll be able to quickly wipe it off without affecting other items on the bottle.
Apply glitter by lightly brushing glue on the bottle in the desired design and then lightly sprinkling glitter on the bottle. Do this over a container, as the majority of the glitter will fall off the bottle and into the container. That way you can reuse the remaining glitter.
Use only enough glue so the jewel or other item sticks to the bottle without having it drip down the sides. Using an excessive amount of glue can leave a sloppy looking bottle.
Since you're likely to be working on the bottle while it still has alcohol inside, don't use any naked flames near your gluing work. Also, bear in mind that there will be added weight to the bottle as you work with it and that the sloshing liquid will sometimes cause movement that might impact your crafting.

, Check for any loose pieces and either glue them on again or remove completely.

, If you're serving at a party, choose a spot where everyone can see it, such as in the middle of a tray and glasses or in the center of a table. If you made a whole row of bedazzled bottles, arrange them across a home or party bar in such a way that they're spotted as soon as someone stands at the bar or table. Perhaps shine a lamp or spotlights onto the bottles, to increase their wow factor.


Take a clever approach to displaying the bottles using fun items around the house. For example slide a bottle of booze into one of your favorite (and maybe not rare or overly expensive) pairs of shoes. This might be cue for a girl’s night in party, a bridal shower or bachelorette party.

, Remove the labels as above and dry.;
, It could be white, green, red, black––whatever color you think will enhance the decorations. Allow to dry and decide whether it needs another coat––it may do because painting on glass tends to appear uneven with the first coat. Allow all coats to dry before proceeding.


This step can be skipped if you'd rather the glass underneath show through (especially where it's already a lovely color such as blue or yellow).

, A cotton bud is ideal for this purpose. Try to keep the spots even in size and location. Allow the dots to dry.

, Aim for a pattern of some regularity. Continue to fill in the design as you wish.

, After this time, it should be fine to use the bottle at your party or event.

, The half of the bottle will either fall off or crack into two parts. If neither happens, lightly pull or tug on one half so that the exertion will cause the bottle to part into two pieces.


Do not hit or screw the bottle to into two parts, as this will cause the bottle to crack into more parts or may not part evenly.

, Using sandpaper or a glass file, smoothly file down the glass evenly. This will allow you to handle glass without worry about being cut.   

, If you make several, these can be turned into drinking glasses, ideal for lemon juice, topped with a lemon slice, etc.

, Collect many creative, bright and sparkly craft and arts items for adding to the bottle.

, This step is optional.

, This can be added around the top and bottom of the half cut wine bottle. Items such as artificial gems, can also be used.

, Then glue them in place.


If using for liquid, use Mod Podge to cover the photos and keep them waterproof.

, Light it and enjoy the magical effects of the light glowing the photo negatives, enjoy you memorable moments lighting in the dark! Or fill with a drink or add a flower.

Identify which items would look good with that 3-D effect.,
Locate your hot glue gun and plenty of wax sticks.,
Purchase a can (or more) of spray paint to cover the item.",How to Create 3D Jars and Vases1," Bottles, vases or items you’d like to transform into a focal point are good candidates.

Only consider items that are in good shape. A broken vase or canister may not be something to upgrade. Toss the old and purchase a new one.



 


Clean the item (if possible) with hot soapy water and allow ample dry time before designing.






Avoid transforming family heirlooms into 3-D pieces. This will damage the integrity of the item and probably motivate your grandmother to write you out of her will.





;
, You will be writing sayings or creating designs with the hot glue gun on the item. Depending on how large of a design or word you plan to use will dictate how much glue you will need.

, While shopping for spray paint explain to the hardware or craft store employee what you are trying to do to ensure you purchase the kind of spray paint that will deliver the best results. Some spray paints work better on certain surfaces.

Prepare an area for spray painting.,
Paint the object.,
Finished.

",How to Create 3D Jars and Vases2," Do a sketch first to make sure you like the writing or design style. The good news about drawing with a hot glue gun is if you don’t like it, you can wipe away the hot glue immediately (you may have to peel it off if it dries)., You want to make sure your glue gun is red hot before use.

, It may be a little difficult to see the actual writing or design since the glue is transparent. Consider creating your design in a well lit area so you can see exactly what you are doing.


Allow ample dry time for the glue gun design. Even allowing it to set for up to 24 hours is a good idea as painting over the wet glue could ruin your project.







, Cover surfaces with newspaper and make sure the room is well ventilated. Consider completing the project outdoors if possible.

, Make sure your spray is even and fully covers the object. You may want to add a few coats of paint depending on the type of surface and item.


Allow paint to dry before adding the item to your room décor.

Gather your supplies and plan ahead.,
Cover your work surface with newspaper.,
Open a glass jar and place a strainer over it.,
Put on a pair of rubber or latex gloves.,
Activate the glow stick.,
Cut the tip of the glow stick off.,
Empty the glow stick into the jar.,
Repeat for the remaining glow sticks.,
Discard the glow stick case and the glass shards.,
Pull the gloves off.,
Consider adding some glitter.,
Close the lid on the jar and shake the jar.,
Take the jar into a dark room.",How to Make Glow Jars1," Glow sticks only glow for two to six hours, depending on the size. Because of this, plan on making the glow jar just before you plan on using it. This will allow you to enjoy your jar for longer. Here's a list of what you will need:


1 glow stick or 2 – 3 bracelet glow sticks
Craft knife or scissors
Jar with lid
Newspaper
Rubber or latex gloves
Strainer
Glitter (optional);
, This project can get messy, so you might want to protect your table. If you don't have newspaper, paper bags or even a cheap, plastic tablecloth would work.

, Glow sticks have a glass tube inside. When you activate a glow stick by snapping it in half, this glass tube shatters. The strainer will catch the glass shards.


Do not plan on using this strainer for cooking again. Even if you clean it, there might be a glass shard stuck in it.

, Although glow sticks are considered to be non-toxic, the chemicals inside can still irritate skin. You will also be working with shattered glass.

, Hold the glow stick with two hands, then snap it briskly in half. Shake it to mix the chemicals inside. It should begin to glow brightly.

, Hold the glow stick over the jar, and cut it using a craft knife or a pair of sharp scissors. Be careful so that the fluid doesn't spray you.


If you are a child, ask a parent to help you.

, Turn the glow stick upside down so the liquid can flow into the jar. The glass shards will get caught in the strainer. You may have to shake and jiggle the glow stick to get everything out.

, Try to use glow sticks that are all one color. Some colors can look nice when they are mixed together, (such as red and white) but others will turn out muddy (such as red and green).

, Throw everything away into the trash can. Make sure that you shake the strainer against the side of the trashcan to dislodge any glass shards that might be stuck in it.

, The best way to do is to grip the glove by the cuff, and tug down on it. The glove will flip inside out. You won't have to worry about touching the glow stick fluid that's on it.

, Your glow jar is almost ready to be used, but you can make it fancier buy adding in about a teaspoon of glitter. You can use any color of glitter you want, but iridescent or a color that matches the glow stick might look best.

, This will cause the glow stick liquid to coat the walls.

, Enjoy the glow while it lasts. It will begin to fade after two to six hours. If you want, you can add more glow stick liquid to the jar the next night.

Gather your supplies.,
Wash the jar using soap and warm water.,
Wipe down the inside of the jar with rubbing alcohol.,
Add a few squirts of paint into the jar.,
Close the lid and shake the jar until the paint covers the inside.,
Open the jar and pour the excess paint back into the bottle.,
Wait for the paint to dry.,
Consider doing one to two more coats for a more intense glow.,
Close the jar, if you want.,
Leave the jar under a bright light for at least 15 minutes before using it.",How to Make Glow Jars2," Unlike glow jars made using glow sticks, these ones never stop glowing. You just have to recharge them every so often by placing them under a bright light for at least 15 minutes. Here's a list of what you will need:


Jar (lid optional)
Rubbing alcohol
Glow-in-the-Dark paint
Super fine scrapbooking glitter (optional)

, Even if the jar looks clean, there might still be some dust on it. Dry the jar off using a clean towel.

, Soak a cotton ball with rubbing alcohol and wipe it down. The rubbing alcohol will get rid of any oil residue, which might prevent the paint from sticking.

, You are putting the paint inside the jar, so it will be less-likely to get chipped or scratched. You don't need a lot of paint, because you will be shaking the jar to spread the paint around.


Consider adding some super fine scrapbooking glitter. This glitter will get mixed in with the paint, and give your jar an extra sparkle.

, You can also tilt the jar and rotate it to help spread the paint around. If the paint doesn't spread very easily, it could be because you did not add enough paint or the paint is too thick. Try adding in a few more squirts of paint, or a few drops of warm water, then shake the jar again.

, This way, the paint will dry faster, and you won't be wasting any paint.

, Most paints will dry in about two hours, depending on how warm or humid it is. Refer to the label for more specific drying times, as each brand will be different.

, The first coat you just did is likely very thin; this means that it won't glow very brightly Once the first coat dries, simply pour more paint into the jar and pour the excess out as before. Let each coat dry completely before adding another one.

, Because this jar doesn't have anything that could spill out of it, it doesn't really need a lid. On the other hand, a lid will help keep the jar clean and dust-free on the inside; it will also help protect the paint.

, Glow-in-the-dark paint does not need a black light in order to glow, but it does need to be charged. Once the glow starts to fade, all you have to do is charge it for another 15 minutes under a bright light.

Discard the ink cartridge and pull off the gloves.,
Put the lid on the jar.,
Place the jar under a black light to make it glow.",How to Make Glow Jars3," This jar cannot glow on its own in the dark. It requires a black light in order to glow, but the glow you do get in the end is bright and worth the effort. Here's a list of what you will need:


Black light
Highlighter
Craft knife
Jar with lid
Water
Newspaper
Rubber or latex gloves

, This project can get a little messy, so you might want to cover your table with a few sheets of newspaper. If you don't have any newspaper, try using a few paper bags or a cheap, plastic tablecloth.

, You will be working with a highlighter ink cartridge, which can get very messy. The gloves will keep your hands from getting stained.

, Pull the cap off of a highlighter, and put the highlighter down on the newspaper. Hold the highlighter with one hand, and cut the plastic case open using your other hand. Try not to cut the ink cartridge inside. Instead, try rotating the highlighter as you cut.


If you are a child, please ask an adult to help you with this step.

, It will look like a felt stick. Some may have a clear piece of plastic wrapped around it. You don't need to remove this clear plastic wrapping, if there is one.


If you want, you can also pull the felt tip out using a pair of tweezers., You only need one ink cartridge per jar. If you pulled the felt tip out, add that to the jar as well.

, The water will help dissolve the ink inside the highlighter. You will be throwing out the ink cartridge out. The water will then glow under a black light., This will help loosen any ink inside the cartridge, and help it start to flow out into the water.

, Over time, you may notice the water start to take on the color of the ink.

, Be sure to wear your rubber or latex gloves for this step. If you added the felt tip into the jar as well, you will want to fish it out using a pair of tweezers. Most felt tips are too hard to be squeezed, so don't worry about that.

, If you used the felt tip as well, then throw it out too. Once you have thrown away the cartridge, pull the gloves off. Tug the glove down by the cuff. This will cause the glove to flip inside out; you won't have to touch the highlighter ink that's on it. Once you have the gloves off, toss them.

, If you want, you can put some super glue along the rim of the jar before putting the lid on; this will prevent anyone from opening the jar and making a mess. Like the jars made with glow-in-the-dark paint, this jar won't run out of glowing power and does not need to be refilled like a glow stick jar.

, Highlighter ink is fluorescent. It won't glow on its own, like glow-in-the-dark paint. It needs a little help from a black light. The jar will only glow under a black light; you cannot charge it to glow in the dark, like a glow-in-the-dark paint jar.

Jar with lid
Water
Glow-in-the-dark or fluorescent paint
Black light (if using fluorescent paint)
Super fine scrapbooking glitter

, Do not fill the jar all the way with water. The paint will add volume once you add it.

, The more paint you add, the more intense the glow will be. You can use fluorescent paint or glow-in-the-dark paint. Here are differences between the two:If you use fluorescent paint, you will need a black light in order to make the paint glow. The paint will stop glowing if you take the black light away.
If you use glow-in-the-dark paint, you will need to leave it under a bright light for at least 15 minutes. It will glow in the dark for up to an hour.

, You will only need about a teaspoon or so. Try to match the glitter color to the paint color.

, You can also put a line of super glue around the rim of the jar before you close it. This will prevent anyone from opening the jar and making a mess.

, Keep shaking until the water is an even color. There should be no swirls or clouds of paint.

, Unlike glow-in-the-dark paint, fluorescent paint cannot be ""charged."" It needs to be next to a black light in order to glow. The minute you take it away from a black light, it will stop glowing.


You can buy black lights at party stores and craft stores.

, After this, the jar will glow on its own for up to an hour. You can re-charge the jar however many times you want.

, If you are using a black light, turn the regular lights off, and the black light on.

, The paint and water may separate over time. If the paint sinks to the bottom of the jar, simply shake the jar to mix it up again.

, Spray carefully and keep it even. Move the jar around as you spray, to ensure full coverage.

, Tiny shells, fake flowers, sand, and beads can be used to decorate the external part of the jar.


Consider deciding on a pattern before adding the decorations. It can be helpful to draw the design on paper, to remind you where the items go.

, Use hot glue, as it will hold the items in place better. Maybe put more decorations near the base of the jar, and thin them out near the top.

, Real ones will need water, which may end up damaging the paint. Or even put in a bunch of twigs, incense sticks or other items, depending on what you want to display.

, Or give it to someone as a gift.

Find a suitable used candle.,
Prepare the candle jar.,
Put the jar in the freezer.,
Leave the jar in the freezer until the wax freezes.,
Take the votive out of the freezer.,
Remove the wax from the jar.,
Remove the wick holder, if necessary.,
Remove any residue.,
Reuse the candle jar.",How to Get Wax Out of a Jar Candle1," This method will be most effective on candle jars that only have a small amount of wax at the bottom. Also, make sure that the candle's wick is not glued to the bottom of the votive.


If your candle's wick is glued to the bottom, the wax may not come out cleanly.Consider pouring boiling water over the candle instead. To learn how to do this, refer to the section in this article on using boiling water to remove wax.;
, Most candle jars become narrower at the opening, which means that the wax can get stuck when you try to remove it. You can prevent this from happening by slicing the wax up inside the jar using a butter knife. When the wax freezes, it will break into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces will be easier to take out than one big piece. Simply stick a butter knife into the jar, and poke the wax, creating slices and slits. You can use this technique on shaped candle holders as well.









If you are using a regular candle holder with straight walls, then you do not need to slice the wax up.

, Set the jar down on a stable surface, so that it does not fall over. Water expands as it freezes, but wax shrinks. This means that the wax will pull away from the sides of the glass.

, This may take as little as 20 to 30 minutesto as long as a couple of hours.

, Once the wax has frozen, you can take the jar out of the freezer. You can test and see if the wax is frozen by pressing down on a corner of it. If the wax moves about or feels loose, that means it is frozen and ready to remove.

, Turn the jar upside down. The wax should fall right out. If it doesn't, you can gently tap the jar against the surface of your table or counter. You could also stick a butter knife between the wax and the glass, and pop it out by pushing down on the knife handle.








, If the wick holder is still stuck to the bottom of the jar, you should be able to pop it right off by slipping the tip of a butter knife underneath it and pushing down on the knife handle.

, There might still be some tiny bits of wax stuck to the jar. If this happens, you can scrape the residue away with a butter knife. You can also remove the wax residue by washing the jar using soap and water, or by wiping it down with some baby oil.







, You can now reuse the candle jar by inserting a new wick and pouring fresh wax into it. You can also decorate it and store pens, utensils, or other items in it.


Consider saving the wax. You can melt this wax down in a double boiler and use it to make candles or wax melts.

Let the paint dry, then close the lid. Place the jar under a bright light for at least 15 minutes, then take it into a dark room. This jar does not need a bright light in order to glow.

, A plain lid can look classic, especially on a mason jar. You can also decorate the lid to make your jar look extra special. Here are some ideas:


Cover the lid with glue, then sprinkle it with glitter. Wait for the glue to dry, then tap the extra glitter off. To prevent the glitter from getting all over the place, spray the lid with a clear, glossy acrylic sealer.
Paint the lid another color using acrylic paint or spray paint.
Glue some ribbon around the edge of the lid using hot glue.
Glue a figurine to the top of the lid using super glue. You can leave the lid and figurine as they are, or you can use spray paint to give it a solid color.Use super glue to stick on some rhinestones onto the lid. Put a drop of super glue onto the lid where you want the rhinestone to go, then press the rhinestone down onto it. Do one rhinestone at a time.
Decorate the lid with some stickers. Try using some star-shaped, glow-in-the-dark stickers.

, You can draw designs and make your jar look like a Jack-o-Lantern or a Day of the Dead sugar skull. You can even draw swirls. This will work best on jars made with glowing sticks or highlighter water., You will need about a teaspoon or so. This will give your jar some extra sparkle. Try to match the color of the glitter to your paint color for the best results.

, Cover the jar with some star-shaped stickers, then paint the jar a solid color using spray paint or acrylic paint. Wait for the paint to dry, then peel off the stickers. The jar will glow through the star-shaped holes., Squirt some white school glue onto a paper plate. Use a foam brush to apply the glue to the outside of the jar. Wait for the glue to dry before using the jar. The matte coating will soften the glow.This would work best for glow stick jars. It is not recommended for glow-in-the-dark paint jars, because they will already have a softer glow.

Alternatively, you can paint the entire jar, then paint on additional designs in a pattern or random formation, such as spots or love hearts.


The paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. Spray paint is recommended, as it's easy to apply and goes on evenly. Spray paint is used for this tutorial.

, Be sure the place you're spraying the jars in is well ventilated, to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.

, If doing more than one jar, add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard, for spraying at the same time.


If you're creating stripes, always mask off the areas that are not to be painted the color you're spraying each time. This includes the already painted areas; ensure each stripe is fully dry before making the next one.

, Don't get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip, leaving drip marks on the jar's surface. Spray evenly.

, Follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times, checking regularly. Once you're sure it's dry, additional decorative elements can be painted on, if wished.

, Here, it's up to your imagination. For example, you might like to tie a ribbon around the mouth of the jar, insert some artificial flowers on the ribbon and hang a little bell off it. Rummage around your craft basket for things that don't have other uses, and hang them off the jar as decoration.

Find a suitable Mason jar.,
Select the paint color and the glitter color so that they complement each other.,
Lay down a piece of box cardboard to cover the work surface.,
Turn the clean jar upside down on the cardboard.,
Spray the jar or jars.,
Leave to dry.,
Decide where you want the glitter line to be.,
Paint Mod Podge at the point of the line, around one row or circle of the jar.,
Repeat in rows or circles around the rest of the jar, in sections.,
Let the glitter sit for an hour.,
Finish with a coating of Mod Podge to protect the glitter and keep it in place, especially when handling or if the jar is knocked.,
Done.",How to Decorate a Mason Jar3," Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.

, For example, you might have a rose pink jar with gold glitter; or a silver jar with red glitter. Try to avoid the exact same paint color with the same glitter color, as the glitter will tend to be overwhelmed by the paint color; use variant shades of the same color if you want the same color theme, preferring the paint in the paler hue and the glitter in the brighter or darker hue. The exception to this is metallic paints with the same metallic glitter color––these tend to look terrific.


Choose high quality craft glitter for the best effects.

, This is the line from which the glitter will go down to the base of the jar (or from an area to the top of the jar). Around a quarter to halfway up from the base is recommended. Place a row of tape around where this line begins, to mark the spot.

, Sprinkle glitter right around this row or circle.

, You can't Mod Podge the entirety of the base (or top) section because the Mod Podge dries out too quickly to allow the glitter to stick. Just work through it methodically and you'll get there.

, This allows it to set properly.

, Let this dry for another hour.

, The glitter and paint jar is now ready for use. It can be used to hold flowers, pens and pencils, lollipops, trinkets, etc. In fact, whatever you like really.

, The best size is one that covers the jar fully and is neither too small, nor too large. If it is too small, perhaps join two doilies together.


If you have to cut the doilies, do so with great care. Use Mod Podge or clear nail polish to seal the cut edges of the doily to prevent fraying while working with it.

,, Take care to smooth out wrinkles or bumps as you go. Allow to dry in place.

, This will seal it and help keep it clean during use. Allow to dry.

, Tie a thin ribbon or a length of burlap around the neck of the jar. You might add something else too, such as a little bell, a small star, a bead or a love heart (made from metal, wood, plastic, glass, etc.) just as a finishing touch.

, The jar can be used for storing items (such as pens and pencils) or you can even use it as a lamp. Drop a votive candle into the base of the jar, light with a long-stick match and see the beautiful patterns the doily makes with the glow of the candle behind it.

The jar can be either clear (untouched) or painted for this project; it's up to you.

, There are various options, including:


Wrapping burlap around the entire jar, either in one large piece or in rows
Placing a large piece of burlap all the way around the middle of the jar, then layering on lace and ribbon and a decorative item
Creating a design using burlap pieces.

, By way of example:


Cut a wide piece of burlap for the center of the jar. Glue in place, making sure the end pieces meet at the end of the jar. Match up neatly, and trim off any excess.
Attach a piece of lace around the center of the burlap piece. Again, make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess.
Place a piece of thin satin ribbon around the center of the lace piece. Again, make the ends meet neatly at the back of the jar and trim off any excess.
If wished, attach a small decoration in the center, such as small dried flowers, a bead, a bow, a key, a love heart, etc. using glue or string.


If wrapping the entire jar in burlap, add the glue in sections and take care to smooth out any wrinkles as you go. If using rows of burlap, add glue for each row as you go.







, Once dry, the burlap wrapped Mason jar is ready to use.

Protect your work surface.,
Slice the wax up.,
Pour boiling water into the jar.,
Let the jar cool for a few hours.,
Poke the wax out.,
Remove the wick holder.,
Remove any residue.,
Reuse the jar.",How to Get Wax Out of a Jar Candle2," This method can get messy, so you will want to protect your counter or table from any spilt wax. You can do this by spreading old towels or newspapers over the surface you will be working on. You can also work on an old baking sheet instead.

, Stick a sharp knife into the candle jar (or any other holder) and start poking the wax, creating small slices and slits. This will help the wax melt faster. It will also help the water get underneath the wax and separate it from the glass.







, Do not fill the jar all the way, however. Eventually, the wax will begin to melt and start floating to the top of the water.








, After a few hours, the water will have cooled down, and the melted wax will have become solid. The only difference is that the wax will now be floating on top of the water, making it easy for you to remove.

, Once the wax has hardened, you should be able to just pop it out. Keep in mind that the water may also spill out of the jar while you are doing this.








, You should be able to remove the wick holder by slipping a knife under it and pop it off. If it doesn't come off easily, simply pour more boiling water over it, and try to remove it again why the water is still hot., If there is any wax still left inside the jar, you should be able to remove it by scraping it off with a knife. You could also wash the jar using soap and warm water. Another way to remove wax residue is by soaking a cotton ball with baby oil and wiping it over the wax and glass.

, You can now reuse the jar as you like. You can pour fresh wax into it to make another candle, or you can decorate it and store items inside of it.


Consider reusing the wax. You can also melt the old wax down again in a double boiler and use it to make candles or wax melts.

"
"
Place the candle jar into a sink or pot.,
Fill the pot or sink with hot water.,
Wait for the wax to soften.,
Remove the softened wax while the water is still warm.,
Take the jar out of the sink or pot.,
Remove the wick holder, if necessary.,
Remove any wax residue.,
Reuse the jar.",How to Get Wax Out of a Jar Candle3," If you have multiple jars that need cleaning, then you can put more inside the sink or pot, so long as they all fit loosely. This method may not work well on candles made from very hard wax, but it will work well on soy candles due to the low melting point of soy-based wax., Make sure that the water level does not go too far past the wax level, in the jars and do not let any water get onto the wax. If you are using a sink, be sure to plug it.








, If you are using a very soft wax, such as soy wax, this should not take long at all. You can test and see whether or not the wax is soft by pressing your finger down onto it. If you are able to create a dent in the wax, then that means that the wax is ready to be removed.


Candles made from harder waxes may be more difficult to remove; however, the part that touches the glass should soften up enough for you to be able to pop the wax out by pushing down on the edge of it.

, Do not take the jar out of the water yet. Instead, hold the jar with one hand. Take a butter knife with the other hand, and slip the blade between the wax and the glass. Wriggle the knife so that it is right under the wax. Gently push down on the knife handle. This should cause the wax to pop right out, or at least loosen it enough so that you can easily remove it.








, If the wax is still inside the jar, you can remove it by turning the jar upside down and gently tapping it against the edge of your counter.








, The wick holder should have come out with the candle, but if it didn't, you can pop it off by slipping the tip of a butter knife between the wick holder and the glass, and then pushing down on the knife handle.

, If there is any wax residue still left inside the jar, you can remove it was washing the jar with soap and warm water. You can also wipe the residue off with a cotton ball soaked in baby oil.








, The jar is now ready to be reused. You can paint or decorate the jar as you like, or you can store items inside of it. You can also add a new wick inside and fill it with wax to make a new candle.


Consider recycling the old wax by melting it down and turning it into new candles or wax melts.

Pre-heat your oven.,
Cover a baking sheet with aluminum foil.,
Place the candle jars upside down on the baking sheet.,
Put the baking sheet into the oven and wait for the wax to melt.,
Pull the baking sheet out of the oven.,
Take the jars off the baking sheet.,
Wipe the jars using a paper towel.,
Reuse the jar.",How to Get Wax Out of a Jar Candle4," Turn the oven on and set the temperature to 200°F (94°C). The warm temperature of the oven will be just enough to let the candle wax melt.

, This will not only protect your baking sheet, but it will also make cleaning up quicker and easier; all you have to do is pull the foil off, scrunch it up, and throw it away. Be sure to cover the sides as shown so that no melted wax will drip onto the baking sheet inadvertently when you remove it from the oven (thus flavoring your next batch of cookies in an unfortunate manner).

, You will be placing the baking sheet into the oven and letting the wax melt, so be sure to leave enough space between each jar. If you have a lot of jars, or jars with a lot of wax in them, consider putting only a few jars onto the sheet at one time; otherwise, you will risk the melted wax over flowing and spilling onto the bottom of your oven.








, After about 15 minutes, the wax should have melted and pooled at the bottom of the baking sheet. Do not leave the oven unattended. Melting wax is very flammable.


Consider leaving a window open. The melting wax will release a lot of fragrant oils. It will make your house smell nice, but it may also give you a headache.

, Set the tray down onto a heat resistant surface.

, The glass will be hot, so be sure to protect your hands using an oven mitt.








, There may be some wax residue inside the jar, especially around the rim, which was touching the melted wax.


If a paper towel does not get the wax out, then try washing the candle jar with soap and water, or wiping it down with a cotton ball soaked in baby oil.

, You can now stick a candle wick into the jar and fill it with wax to make a new candle. You can also paint the jar and use it to hold items, such as pens.


Consider melting the old wax down and using the melted wax to make smaller candles or wax melts.

Look for a sticker or stamp.,
Ask the seller whether the piece of Murano glass is new or old.,
Be extra careful with paperweights and aquariums.",How to Identify Murano Glass1," If it says “Made in Italy” or “Made in Venice,” it is not likely to be Murano glass. These are two ways outside glass makers try to convince tourists that the item was likely made in Murano without stating it is.


An item that is labeled “Made in Murano” may be counterfeit. Currently, many items are made in China and sold in Venice as Murano glass.
Similarly, if the item says “Murano-style” it is unlikely to be authentic Murano glass.;
, New glass from Murano should be accompanied by a certificate from the factory, guaranteeing it is Murano glass. If bought and sold by art or antiques dealers, it should accompany the piece of glass in all sales.


Murano glass made before 1980 is unlikely to have a certificate, so this is only a surefire identification method for new glass., These are the most commonly counterfeit items, sold as Murano glass, but made elsewhere. Move on to the next identification methods to identify whether or not it is Murano glass.

"
"
Don’t count on your ability to identify a real piece of Murano glass by color.,
Beware of trying to identify Murano glass on the Internet.,
Look for a signature on the glass itself.,
Try to find evidence of real gold or silver used in the production of the glass.

,
Identify evidence of a hand-made piece.,
Look for misshapen fish, clouded glass or bleeding colors.",How to Identify Murano Glass2," This is something only a trained eye and glass expert can do with reliability.

, If you are looking at buying an item, it is better to identify it through a signature of a master glass-maker, a catalog or an authenticity certificate., The following are master glass makers from Murano: Ercole Barovier, Archimede Seguso, Aureliano Toso, Galliano Ferro, Vincenzo Nason, Alfredo Barbini, and Carlo Moretti. There are many more master glass makers that worked at Murano glass factories over the years.


If the signature looks as though it has been scratched into the surface after it hardened, with a carbide-tipped pen, it is likely a counterfeiter trying to sell a fake piece as a designer original.
You will need to move on to the next method to find whether the signature is in the correct place. Catalogs will tell you about signature and label placement.

,, Murano glass is hand-blown, meaning there should be bubbles and asymmetrical qualities., While hand-blown glass is not completely uniform, these mistakes are rarely made.

Read the “Murano Glass Glossary” at fossilfly.com.,
Request a catalog from the factory itself.,
Hire a glass expert to help you identify the glass.",How to Identify Murano Glass3," It is a good primer for the techniques and styles of Murano glass. You may want to refer back to it when you are looking at factory catalogs.

, Factories have catalogs of at least their current offerings, but possibly also their vintage glass. Look on 20thcenturyglass.com to find popular Murano glass factories, and then search for their websites so that you can request a catalog.

, If the authenticity is still in question, you should contact a local glass antique expert and show them all the information you have. Although experts are not 100 percent accurate, they will have an easier time identifying it than almost anyone else.


If you can’t find an expert, try posting pictures and information on an antique glass forum. You may be able to discover more creative ways of identifying the glass.

Add 5 drops of food coloring to the mix.,
Swirl the mixture around.,
Pour the mixture out.,
Let it air dry.,
Dry the jar in the oven.",How to Color Mason Jars1," Layer a couple sheets of newspaper on top of the table or surface you are working on. The newspaper will protect your work surface from Mod Podge and food coloring spills., You must do this if you are re-using an old mason jar. Wipe the inside and outside of the jar with a cotton swab soaked in rubbing alcohol. Then wash the jar with soap and water. Use a clean, dry towel to dry the jar.If you are using new, unused mason jars, then just rinse the jars with water, and dry them with a clean towel.

, Pour 4 tablespoons (60 ml) of Mod Podge onto a paper plate. Then mix in 2 tablespoons (15 ml) of water. Using a plastic spoon (or a popsicle stick), mix the Mod Podge and water together until they are well-combined., Use a color of your choice; it could be blue, red, green, purple or yellow. Use your spoon to mix the food coloring into the mixture. Mix until the food coloring is well-combined, or until all of the specks of color are completely gone.The color may look pastel at this point. Don’t worry, however, because once it dries, it will be a regular, non-pastel color.
If you want a lighter shade, then only use 2 to 3 drops of food coloring. If you want a darker shade, then use more than 5 drops of food coloring.

, Pour the mixture into the jar. Using your hand, tilt the jar from left to right. Do this until the entire surface inside of the jar is coated with the mixture. As you coat the inside, make sure the mixture does not drip out.Alternatively, hold the jar with both of your hands. Roll the jar from one hand to the other until the entire surface is coated inside the jar.
Avoid using a paintbrush to coat the inside of the jar. This will result in a streaky look (unless that is what you are going for).

, Do this once the entire inside surface of the jar is coated. Pour the excess mixture out onto a paper plate. As you pour out the mixture, make sure to coat the mouth of the jar. Then place the jar upside down on a paper plate for a couple minutes. This way you can make sure all of the excess mixture is removed.To ensure an even color, let the mixture drain until only a thin layer is left on the inside of the jar.
Make sure to wipe away any excess mixture from the jar’s rim.

, After the excess mixture has drained completely, use a paper towel to wipe away any excess from the jar’s rim. Then place the jar right side up on top of a clean paper plate or newspaper. Let the jar air dry for 24 to 48 hours., Use the oven if you want to speed up the drying process. Line a cookie sheet with wax paper. Place your jar upside down on the cookie sheet. Put the jar in a pre-heated, 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) oven for three minutes. Remove the jar from the oven and place it right side up on the cookie sheet. Use a paper towel to wipe away any mixture from the jar’s rim. Place the jar back in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes."

Choose a solid workspace.,
Cut the Plexiglas, if necessary.,
Clean the Plexiglas.,
Set the acrylic glass in place for gluing.,
Apply the glue to the joint.,
Allow the glue to set.,
Sand the joint smooth.,
Check the joint to ensure it is watertight.,
Finished.

",How to Glue Plexiglas," Your workspace should be made of wood, metal, or concrete. Grass or paper are not good choices, as the Plexiglas could adhere to these materials.;
, Prepare the pieces to be joined by cutting them to the proper size and shape. Acrylic glass that is a quarter inch (6.3 mm) or thicker is best cut with a table saw or miter saw. Pieces that are thinner than this can be scored with a utility knife and then snapped cleanly apart, but only along straight lines.If your cut edges are rough, sand and polish them so you have a clean and smooth edge on which to apply the glue.Remove the protective film, if applicable, after cutting so as not to scratch the Plexiglas.

, Before attempting to join the acrylic glass, clean the pieces with a mild soap and water, focusing on the edges that will be glued. After cleaning and rinsing the pieces, blot them dry thoroughly with a clean cloth - don’t rub, or you may scratch the surface.


You can also clean acrylic glass with isopropyl alcohol., Once you have cleaned the pieces, fit them together as they will be joined. After ensuring a snug fit, secure the pieces together with either masking tape or clamps., The glue must be applied with a syringe, because it is water-thin and works by melting the acrylic to bond two pieces together. Using a 25 gauge syringe, apply a small amount of methylene chloride (such as Weld-On #3) to the joint between the two acrylic glass pieces, drawing the syringe toward you rather than pushing it away.Wear heavy rubber gloves and safety glasses when applying the methylene chloride.
Do not attempt to apply the solvent cement to the pieces separately and then press them together. This method will produce a weaker joint and up the risk of drips. These will melt and deform any acrylic glass they touch.

, You should let the glue set for 24-48 hours to ensure a secure bond. You can then remove any clamps or tape that were holding the pieces of acrylic glass together., Allow the glue to set completely, then use a fine-grit sandpaper to smooth out any rough patches of adhesive. Clean off the dust when you are finished sanding by washing the acrylic glass with soap and water or isopropyl alcohol., If the acrylic glass will be used to contain water, you should check your joint for leaks. Run water over the joint or submerge the piece in water, and check for the appearance of leaks. If the glass leaks, allow it to dry thoroughly then apply additional glue to the joint.

Every day, think of something that made you happy.,
Write it down on a piece of paper.,
Make deposits into the happiness jar daily.,
Read the messages when life gets tough.",How to Keep a Happiness Jar," It could be something that happened that very day, but it could really be anything. Be truthful to yourself; the simpler things that delighted you are often the happiest moments.


Set aside your cultural, faith-based understandings of ""prayers/luck/wishes"", etc. that seek happiness; also set aside any inner voice criticisms about happiness. One of the things that may impact your use of the jar is prior understandings or inculcated messaging about what ""rules"" you need to follow to get the jar to ""work"". The thing is, there are no rules. The jar is to serve you, rather than you serving the ritual.
If you want to put other things in the jar, like a lucky token, ticket stub from a trip you loved or a note from a loved one, go ahead. It's your jar and your fulfillment.
A variation of this concept is to focus on happy moments from a certain relationship in your life, like your relationship with your mate, or your children. A couple, for example, can commit to writing down things they love about each other every day and depositing the notes into the same jar.;
, Find scraps of paper suitable for writing a small message on. You could go to the effort of making a pile of ready-made pieces of paper (this can be a good motivator to keep doing this each day) or you could simply rip a piece of paper from a napkin, junk mail, or similar, as needed.


If you can't find a piece of paper, write your note on your phone. Send a text message or e-mail to yourself and remember to transcribe it later, so you can put a physical note in the jar.

, The idea is somewhat to use it daily but life can get busy and events intervene, so if you miss days, don't be fussed; just pick it up from where you left off.


Set a daily reminder or alarm on your phone.
Keep the jar in a safe place where it's less likely to be bumped or in the way of everyday activities but ideally, it should be in sight to remind you to use it.
If the jar has a lid, keep the lid on in case it gets knocked over. This also keeps the dust out, especially important if your jar is very large and will be sitting in the same spot for months or years.

, This is the most wonderful part of using a happiness jar. When you feel that everything is getting to you and that there isn't much happiness in your life, take out a few of the messages and read them through. These reminders of the happiness that has been in your life and will continue to be present in your life will serve as a source of morale boosting. Your past happiness will comfort you and give you hope that there is more to come. It will also remind you that happiness is found in moments along the journey and is not a single destination with any defined point or actions.


Some people enjoy starting a new happiness jar every year, and reading the contents at the end of the year.
Consider making a collage or scrapbook of all your notes.
You may wish to share your happiness jar on Pinterest and/or even with Elizabeth Gilbert. There are a few dedicated Pinterest pages featuring happiness jars; just do a quick search in the site. Other sites such as Facebook, Tumblr, etc. also have some ongoing shared happiness jar projects.

Add chemicals to produce a desired color in the glass, if any.,
Place the mixture in a good heat-resistant crucible or holder.,
Melt the mixture into a liquid.,
Homogenize and remove bubbles from the molten glass.,
Shape the molten glass.,
Slowly cool the glass in a kiln.",How to Make Glass1," Also called quartz sand, silica sand is the primary ingredient in making glass. Glass without iron impurities is sought for clear glass pieces, as the iron will cause the glass to appear greenish when present.


Wear a face mask if handling extremely fine-grain silica sand. If inhaled, it can irritate the throat and lungs.
Silica sand is available from online retailers. It is fairly cheap - small quantities shouldn't cost more than 20 dollars.If you want to operate on an industrial scale, specialty retailers can offer competitive rates on large orders - sometimes lower than $100 per ton.
If it is not possible to find sand sufficiently free of iron impurities, their tinting effect can be countered by adding small amounts of manganese dioxide. Or, if you want greenish glass, leave the iron in!;
, Sodium carbonate (commonly called washing soda) lowers the temperature necessary to make glass commercially. However, it permits water to pass through the glass, so calcium oxide, or lime, is added to negate this property. Oxides of magnesium and/or aluminum may also be added to make the glass more durable. Generally, these additives take up no more than 26 to 30 percent of the glass mixture.

, The most common addition for decorative glass is lead oxide, which provides the sparkle in crystal glassware, as well as the softness to make it easier to cut and also lowers the melting point. Eyeglass lenses may contain lanthanum oxide because of its refractive properties, while iron helps glass absorb heat.


Lead crystal can contain up to 33 percent lead oxide; however, the more lead oxide, the more skill required to shape the molten glass, so many lead crystal makers opt for less lead content.

, As noted above, iron impurities in quartz sand make glass made with it appear greenish, so iron oxide is added to increase the greenish tint, as is copper oxide. Sulfur compounds produce a yellowish, amber, brownish or even blackish tint, depending on how much carbon or iron is also added to the mixture.

, The container should be able to withstand the extremely high temperatures within the kiln - depending on your additives, your glass mixture may melt at a range of temperatures between 1,500 and 2,500 degrees Celsius. Your container should also be easily grasped with metal hooks and poles.

, For commercial silica glass, this is done in a gas-fired furnace, while specialty glasses may be created using an electric melter, pot furnace or kiln.


Quartz sand without additives becomes glass at a temperature of 2,300 degrees Celsius (4,172 degrees Fahrenheit). Adding sodium carbonate (soda) reduces the temperature needed to make glass to 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,732 degrees Fahrenheit).

, This means stirring the mixture to a consistent thickness and adding chemicals such as sodium sulfate, sodium chloride or antimony oxide.

, Shaping the glass can be done in one of several ways:


The molten glass can be poured into a mold and let cool. This method was used by the Egyptians, and it is also how many lenses are created today.
A large amount of molten glass can be gathered at the end of a hollow tube, which is then blown into while the tube is turned. The glass is shaped by the air entering the tube, gravity pulling on the molten glass and whatever tools the glassblower uses to work the molten glass.
The molten glass can be poured into a bath of molten tin for support and blasted with pressurized nitrogen to shape and polish it. Glass made by this method is called float glass, and it is how glass panes have been made since the 1950s.

, This process is called annealing, and it removes any stress points that may have formed in the glass during cooling. Glass that has not been annealed is significantly weaker. Once this process is completed, the glass can then be coated, laminated or otherwise treated to improve its strength and durability.


The precise temperature for annealing can vary based on the precise composition of the glass from as low as 750 degrees Fahrenheit to as high as 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. The rate at which the glass must cool may also change - generally, larger pieces of glass must cool more slowly than smaller pieces. Research proper annealing methods before beginning.
A related process is tempering, in which shaped and polished glass is placed in an oven heated to at least 600 degrees Celsius (1,112 degrees Fahrenheit) and then quick-cooled (""quenched"") with blasts of air at high pressure. Annealed glass breaks into shards at 6,000 pounds per square inch (psi), while tempered glass breaks into small pieces at no less than 10,000 psi and usually at around 24,000 psi.

This includes, but isn't limited to, soda bottles, beer bottles, wine bottles, condiment bottles, perfume bottles, and so on. Before your chosen bottle is ready to melt, you need to make sure it is clean and dry. This includes any labels or even fingerprints that may be on it!


Labels that are difficult to remove can be soaked in hot, soapy water. A good soak for a few hours or overnight should make the labels easier to peel off.You'll also have to remove any glue that remains from the label. After a soak in hot, soapy water, you can usually scrape the glue off without much ado. A tool like a putty knife, wallpaper scraper, or an unwanted credit card can help.
If your bottles have labels that appear painted, like Corona or Belvedere bottles, you can melt your bottle with these still in place. However, after melting, those labels will be permanently melted to your bottle.;
, Kilns can become dirty over time, collecting dust and bits of debris from other projects. This dirtiness can have a negative impact on your kiln's heating elements and can severely shorten the working life of your kiln. To prevent an expensive and unnecessary cost to yourself, before you use your kiln you should thoroughly clean it according to the manual's instructions.While you're cleaning you'll have a perfect chance to give your kiln a quick safety inspection. Tighten any screws that seem loose, remove any flammable material from around your kiln, and verify that all kiln equipment is in good working order.

, To guarantee your kiln is running as desired, you should consider giving your kiln a test run. You should always use the testing materials and procedure recommended by your manual, but generally, you can test your kiln with a 04 self-supporting Witness Cone. Place one of these on each shelf about 2 inches (5 cm) away from the kiln wall. Then you should:


Set your kiln to run the appropriate test setting, which will be a medium speed 04 ConeFire program if you are using an 04 cone. Allow the program to run for the complete time indicated.
After the program has run and your kiln sufficiently cooled, take a look at your cones or testing material. If using a Witness Cone, you should notice a 20° bend or greater in the cone, with no cones hanging lower than the shelf. If you used other testing materials, check your manual to learn how to understand the results of your test.
If after running the ConeFire program none of your cones have bent, this may be an indication that your heating element or a relay may have decayed. In this case, you may need to call a professional, like a kiln technician, to get your kiln back in working order., If you don't protect the surfaces your melted glass is going to come in contact with, your glass will fuse to those surfaces. An application of kiln wash or glass separator on your shelf and mold will prevent the glass from sticking to either of these.


An alternative you might use in place of a kiln wash is special kiln resistant paper, like thin-fire or fiber paper. These will also prevent your glass from melting to your kiln or molds., Molding and slumping are the two main techniques used in glass melting. Generally, molding is where you melt your glass in a kiln and allow it to fill a mold, giving the glass a new shape. Slumping is where you allow the glass to collapse inward on itself to create a unique, freeform shape that might make a suitable table centerpiece or paperweight, among other things.


You can also choose a hybrid of these two techniques. Glass slump molds are available at some art/ceramics stores and online. Using these, you can slump your glass into the approximate shape of a mold. This is great for making spoon holders, shallow bowls, and vases., A firing profile divides the heating and cooling process of your kiln into segments. Each segment requires that you change the in-kiln temperature at a certain rate, holding the temperature at certain benchmarks. The firing profile you use will influence the finished product of your glass art and will depend on the kind of glass you use.


Different kinds of glass are made by different chemical processes. Some kinds of glass will react better to one firing profile better than another, so you may have to experiment before you find the best profile for your glass melting.Many firing profiles are available free online, though some may have come with the manual of your kiln. In some cases, the firing profile recommended by your kiln manufacturer might not produce good results. In this case, you'll have to tweak your profile., Now that your bottles and kiln are clean, your kiln inspected and tested, and your surfaces covered to prevent glass from fusing, you're almost ready to melt your glass. But first, you should position your bottle stably in a central position in your kiln.


If you are using a mold, it should surround your bottle or be positioned in a way that your bottle fills the mold as it melts. The best positioning will depend entirely on the kind of kiln you are using., The first segment of your heating is intended to warm the bottle and should not exceed a rate of 500°F (260°C). You may even want to choose a lower rate for slower heating. This will add time to the melting process, but will protect your mold, if you are using one, from cracking because of thermal shock.As your kiln achieves the temperature indicated in each segment of your firing profile, you should hold that temperature for however long indicated in the profile. This is usually a short period of time, around 10 - 12 minutes in many cases.
You should always wear the appropriate safety gear recommended by your kiln manual when operating your kiln. In many cases this will include heat resistant gloves and safety googles.

, After your kiln has reached 1100°F (560°C), it should be softening the glass. The thinner sections of your bottle, like the middle parts, should begin collapsing. You'll want to keep the temperature throughout the bottle consistent at this stage for best results. A lower ramp rate of about 250°F (121°C) is recommended for this purpose.


The hold time, at this point, will be a little longer than preceding hold times. This longer hold time gives the temperature a chance to equalize., At this point in your firing profile, your kiln will be reaching temperatures that should be causing the bottle to slump in earnest. From 1300°F (704°C) you should ramp at 300°F (148°C) per hour until you reach temperatures of about 1430°F (776°C).


Once your kiln is at the peak temperature in your firing profile, you should allow for a hold time of about 10 minutes. Slight variations in hold time and temperature will influence the how much your bottle melts., Annealing is where you allow your glass to rest at a temperature below its freezing point, which is a little below 1000°F (537°C) for many kinds of glass. Hold this temperature for about one hour per ¼ inch (.64 cm) of thickness to relieve stress on your glass art, which will make it less prone to cracking.Once the inside of your kiln has reached room temperature, you can open it and remove your glass. Be careful when doing so, as the glass may still be hot to the touch.
Opening your kiln before it has naturally cooled to room temperature may cause thermal shock. This could cause your glass to crack or shatter., Glass that is crushed up into small pieces is referred to as frit. If your kiln isn't level and you are having a difficult time keeping your bottle positioned as you desire, you can sprinkle some pieces of frit to either side of the bottle to prevent it from rolling.


Once the bottle begins to slump, it will lose its roundness and rolling will no longer be an issue. Until then, your frit should keep your bottle in place., When your glass bottle gets too hot, it can fold inward to the lower areas of your mold and create dangerous sharp edges. Decrease your peak temperature by 10° increments until you get the results you desire.


You can also blunt sharp edges by decreasing your hold time. Shorten the time by 5 minutes or less in your future firings. If the sharp edges remain, continue to decrease the hold time in this fashion.
In some cases, you may have the best results by lowering your temperature and shortening your hold time. You'll have to experiment to find what works best for the glass and kiln you are using., Melting glass is a very precise process. Even the difference of a few degrees or minutes can completely change the outcome of your glass art project. You should pay special attention to temperature, hold times, ramp rates, and the kind of glass you are melting., There are many small factors that can have a significant affect your glass melting. The time you hold your temperature benchmarks, the rate of increase/decrease in temperature, the number of bottles you're trying to melt in a single firing -- all of these factors play a part in how your glass melts.But with a little time and practice, you'll soon be creating beautiful glass art melting bottles.

Prepare a makeshift furnace from a charcoal barbecue grill.,
Know the dangers of this method.,
Take every possible precaution to protect yourself and your property from the high heat.,
Get a shop vacuum with a long hose attachment.,
Line the inside of your grill with charcoal.,
Light the charcoal.,
Wait for the charcoal to get hot.,
Turn the shop vac on to introduce air to the charcoal.,
When your glass is molten, very carefully use metal implements to remove and shape it.",How to Make Glass2," This method uses the heat generated by a large charcoal fire to melt silica sand into glass. The materials used are relatively cheap and common - theoretically, all you'll need is a short trip to the hardware store to be ready to make your own glass. Use a large charcoal barbecue grill - standard-size ""dome"" models work well. Use the thickest, sturdiest grill available. Most charcoal grills will have a vent on the bottom - open this vent.


Even at the extremely hot temperatures reached in this method, it can be difficult to melt silica sand in a grill. Add a small quantity (about 1/3 to 1/4 of your sand's volume) of laundry soda, lime, and/or borax to your sand before you begin. These additives lower the sand's melting temperature.
If you're going to blow your glass, have a long, hollow, metal tube handy. If you're going to pour it into a mold, prepare your mold beforehand. You want a mold that won't burn or melt from the heat of molten glass - graphite works well.

, This method will push a conventional barbecue past its normal temperature limits - so hot that it's even possible to melt the grill itself. This method can cause severe injury or death if it's attempted recklessly. Proceed with caution. Have a large quantity of dirt or sand or a fire extinguisher rated for high temperatures on hand to smother the fire if needed.

, Attempt this method on a concrete surface outdoors with plenty of space. Don't use any irreplaceable equipment. Stand clear of the grill while you're heating the glass. You should also wear as much of protective clothing as possible, including:


Heavy duty oven gloves or mitts
A welder's mask
A heavy duty apron
Heat-resistant clothing

, Using duct tape or another method, angle its hose so that it is blowing directly into the bottom vent without touching the grill's main body. You may want to fasten the hose to one of the grill's legs or wheels. Keep the main vacuum unit as far away from the grill as possible.


Make sure the hose is secure and will not move - if it comes loose while you're making your glass, you should not approach the grill if it's extremely hot.
Turn the vacuum on to test your hose positioning. An accurate hose will blow directly into the vent.

, Use more charcoal than you would for grilling meat. Successful results have been achieved by filling the grill nearly to the brim.Place a cast-iron pot or crucible containing your sand in the center of the grill, surrounded by charcoal.


Hardwood (or ""lump"") charcoal burns hotter and quicker than briquette charcoal, making it a better choice if it's available., Consult the charcoal's packaging to know whether your charcoal can be lit directly or whether it requires lighter fluid. Allow the flames to spread evenly.

, When the charcoals are grayish and emanating an orange glow, they're ready. You should be able to feel the heat from simply standing near the grill.

, Charcoal fed with air from the bottom can burn extremely hot (up to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Beware - large flame-ups may occur.


If you're still not able to reach high enough temperatures, experiment with replacing the lid while introducing air through the vent.

, Because of the low temperature of the grill method, the molten glass may be stiffer and harder to work than glass from a kiln. Shape it with a tube, mold, or other tools as you normally would.

Purchase a ""fiberglass kit."",
Think of a mold for your fiberglass.,
Use foam or pliable materials for molds with organic shapes.,
Use cardboard, plywood, MDF, or other stiff materials for molds with linear or geometric shapes.,
Prepare the fiberglass mat or cloth in sheets cut to suitable sizes to cover your form, allowing for plenty of overlap where you need to join it at corners or sharp curves.,
Measure an appropriate amount of resin in a metal container.,
Add the hardener, according to package instructions.,
Stir this material thoroughly, being careful to stir the bottom and sides, and not just the middle of the container, using a paint stick.

,
Lay mat on or in your form, and spread the resin mixture over it with a disposable paint brush.,
Work the mat and resin completely over your form until it is covered uniformly.,
Clean up any tools or spills with a solvent containing acetone before the material hardens.,
Repeat the steps of applying mat and resin until the finished project is as thick as you want it.,
Finish your project by coating with gel coat or a smooth coat of resin.,
Remove your fiberglass from the form.",How to Fiberglass," A kit should contain the poly (polyester) resin, hardener (catalyst), and cloth for structural strength. You can buy kits from home centers, department stores, or auto parts stores in various sizes depending on your project.


What exactly is fiberglass? Fiberglass starts off as a liquid. This liquid is then extruded through tiny little holes, which turn it into thin strands of threads. These threads are coated with a chemical solution and bundled together to form rovings, or long bundles of fibre. Add a bit of resin and you have strong, durable, flexible fiberglass.;
, If you are making fiberglass for project, like a simple box, bowl, or other shape, you probably want to assemble a ""mold"" or ""form"" to make sure that your fiberglass, which starts off in liquid form, adheres to the right shape. If you find yourself doing a fiberglass repair on a boat or car, for example, consider taping off the repair site and apply the resinous fiberglass coating directly to the repair site.

, Blocks of styrofoam or polystyrene foam work best for objects that have curves or other non-linear forms. Simply cut or shave the foam into your desired shape, such as a fountain bottom, bird bath, or dome. Cover the material with wax paper, and use wax to seal and attach all joints, as well as for smoothing rough seams.

, These stiffer materials are best for large projects like dog houses or even boats. For these molds, cover the entire surface either with wax paper, or a good, even coat of paraffin wax. Carnauba wax can also be used as a substitute for paraffin wax.

, The material will become very flexible when the resin is applied, so don't worry if you cannot get it to conform to an exact shape while it is dry.

, A large can or metal bowl will work, but it should be of a disposable nature. Resin can be mixed in a clean plastic container, but because it generates heat when it sets, extreme care should be taken if you use one.

, In a kit, you will have a pre-measured ""can"" or bucket of resin, and a pre-measured ""tube"" (like a glue tube) of hardener, so you can safely use an equal proportion of each material, i.e., half your hardener and half your resin, or some other proportion.

,, The mat (or cloth) will seem to melt into the resin as you spread it, and you can use the brush and additional coats of resin to build up the layer of fiberglass to a thickness of up to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm).


As you spread the resin over the fiberglass mat, make sure to apply it over corners and weak spots with the same coverage that you would over flat, easy-to-reach surfaces. If you fail to get good coverage in corners, for example, your fiberglass will eventually develop weaknesses in those corners.

, Continue working until you have used all of your material.

, Acetone is great for cleaning up fiberglass because it's strong and evaporates quickly. Just be sure not to soak any portion of the fiberglass in acetone, and keep acetone away from any caulking, plastic, or rubber., Fiberglass is usually applied in layers until it is thick enough to give the required strength you desire to achieve. Depending on your project (leaving room for flexibility of course), try at least 3 layers, but no more than 10.If possible, try laying down the fiberglass mat with the fibers oriented in different directions with each new layer. Fiberglass is strong across its axis but weak along its axis; if you can orient the strand mat so that its weak points are distributed along various axes instead of a single axis, you'll end up with much stronger fiberglass.
Sand in between steps to eliminate rough spots where mat or cloth may project through the resin.

, Then, paint with a polyurethane or alkyd enamel, if desired.

, If you have covered your form or mold with wax paper or paraffin wax, you should be able to peel the form from inside the shape, or peel the shape off of the form. The fiberglass will not stick to the wax.

, Cut out the shape of the area the design will sit inside (for example, a circle, square or other geometrical shape) from the center of the plastic sheet. Keep the cut-out piece, this will be reused shortly.

, The cut-out area must align exactly with where you want to apply the design.

, If you're confident enough, you can skip the tracing paper and draw straight onto the plastic adhesive cut-out. Otherwise, transfer the design from the tracing paper onto the adhesive plastic cut-out.

, Using the craft knife, cut around the outline of the design. Discard the pieces that are cut away.

, Run your thumbnail over the edges to smooth down.

, Use smooth strokes to apply, and brush on thickly.

, Rinse off with water.

, The remaining design should now be etched into the glass.

Blast until the design has been etched in place.,
Rinse the glass under water before touching, or wipe down with a disposable damp rag if the glass cannot be moved.,
Remove the resist from the glass.,
Admire your handiwork.",How to Etch Glass2," The pattern is the part of the glass that will be etched by the sandblasting, while the surrounding area is covered by the resist to protect it from being blasted. Contact paper or very wide strong clear vinyl adhesive tape make a good form of resist. Some people also use wax but that can be very tricky unless you're experienced.


Whatever you choose, make sure its adhesive is strong, so that it won't peel off when being sandblasted.

, For example, a leaf and berries. Draw the design on paper.


In some cases, pre-made adhesive designs on adhesive backing can be purchased from craft stores or glass blasting suppliers. You may need a small craft knife to help you pull out the unwanted parts of the stencil design.

, Either trace the design on with carbon paper or spray adhesive onto the back of the design and stick it direct to the contact paper (and cut through both the design paper and the contact paper).

, The glass must be covered well, so that it won't lift and spoil the design.


You may need to tape around the edges of the stencil to ensure that it stays firmly in place and to protect surrounding glass, such as if you're blasting a window. Use wide tape and add as much as you think is needed to protect the surrounding area from blasting.
Flat surfaces are easiest, such as windows, photo frame glass, etc. Jars, drinking glasses and other curved surfaces will be trickier.

, Always wear safety goggles, a respirator mask, and gloves before sandblasting. Glass dust can cause serious damage to the eyes and lungs if you are unprotected.

,


Depending on what the object is, you may wish to use a sandblasting cabinet, into which you can place small glass items such as a jar or drinking glass. If you do use this, place the glass in the sandblasting cabinet and check all of the controls and get ready to blast.
For larger glass pieces, such as windows, these will need to be sandblasted in place. In this case, use the tape method explained above to protect the surrounding glass.

, When blasting, hold the blaster upright over the glass and don't place the blaster too close to the glass.


Take care not to angle the blaster during sandblasting, or there is a risk of the resist lifting and ruining the design.

, This cleaning will remove glass dust and any debris.

, Use warm soapy water to remove any remaining adhesive. Allow the glass to dry.

, A beautifully etched design will now be evident on the glass.

Spread the etching cream onto the bare glass portion of the design.,
Leave the etching cream on for the time specified by the manufacturer.,
Peel the adhesive stencil off the vase or jar.",How to Etch Glass3," If this is your first try, use a cheap one so that you can practice.

,, A circle or oval are good choices, or perhaps a square or triangle. Draw this shape into the middle of the adhesive plastic, then cut out with a sharp knife. Stick the sheet onto the vase or jar, carefully placing the geometric hole in the central position.


Keep the cut out adhesive plastic shape for use next.

, Cut the shape out.


Ideas for the shape include flowers, symbols, letters, animals, sun or moon, etc. Keep the design very simple; use stencil books or webpage designs for inspiration.

, Then carefully cut out this shape from the plastic using a sharp craft knife. Go slowly, as this needs to be well defined.

, Smooth out any edge bubbles or ripples so that it sits entirely flat against the glass.


A thumbnail run over the edges will flatten out air bubbles nicely.

, This will be the glass that goes from the edge of the design to the edge of the geometric shape.


Apply thickly with a flat brush or sponge brush. Use smooth strokes.
Follow any additional instructions provided with the etching cream.

, Then rinse off with water.

, You should be left with a pretty design inside a geometric shape. Well done!

Your design can be anything you want, such as a bird, a tree, or letters, but remember that what you draw will be cut out and this shape will be what’s etched on the glass.Patterned stencils may also be available, ordered online, or designed and printed.
For letters, instead of using a stencil, you can etch around tape letters.;
, This is only necessary if your stencil cannot adhere directly to the glass. Get a piece of vinyl larger than your stencil. Set the stencil in front of it, then secure the stencil to it by applying tape over the stencil’s edges.









, Using an X-acto knife or other sharp knife, cut out your design along the outlines you made. Hold the blade upwards so only the tip touches the stencil. Remove the parts you want to be etched into the glass, taking care not to tear the surrounding space.







, While glass cleaners such as Windex can be used, these may leave a residue that causes uneven etching. Isopropyl rubbing alcohol will remove all debris and fingerprints. Grip the glass in a place that won’t be etched and use a fresh, soft cloth to spread the cleaner and dry the glass.







, When using vinyl shelf liner or a stencil with an adhesive backing, peel off the back surface. Bring the stencil up to the area you wish to etch, then use the adhesive to attach it to the glass.










If you’re using tape to create letter outlines, tape the letters and then cover the rest of the glass you don’t want to etch.

, Whatever adhesive you use, check it over for bubbles. Any raised areas of tape can ruin the etching since the cream will get in there. Run a smoothing tool over the tape to flatten it. Something sturdy, such as a plastic gift card, works well., Only the area you want to be etched should be covered. Use a paint brush or popsicle stick to spread a thick, even coating over the area. Wear gloves to prevent any of the irritating cream from getting on your skin.







, For a more pronounced etching, use your brush to move the cream on top of your stencil. At about the 1 ½ minute and 3 ½ minute marks, do this to break up air pockets that will cause uneven etching., Overall, including stirring, the cream needs to stay on the glass at least five minutes. If you remove the cream before five minutes,your design will appear lighter. After five minutes, you won’t notice much more improvement in the etching., Hot water from a faucet will remove the cream while loosening the tape. If you have a ceramic sink or are worried about your plumbing, dip the glass in a clean bucket of water and use a clean cloth to make sure all the cream is gone.







, Peel back the adhesive you used. A hook-shaped tool can be used to attack the corner of stubborn tape. To avoid scratching the glass, avoid pointing any sharp object at it.









, Wipe off any moisture with a clean cloth. Your etching will be finished. It is permanent, so the glass can be used safely and washed in a dishwasher.

,, Fill the container with water until it just covers it. The glass must be underwater during the entire drilling process.

, You can use a hollow core bit if you wish, but I have had better success with a solid or even a tapered bit from the local home project store.

,, It should be spinning the bit at 20,000 to 30,000 rpm.

, Hold the rotary tool so the bit is perpendicular to the glass.

, Do not try to force it to cut quickly. It will take a minute or two for it to go through the glass.

,, You should have a nice clean hole all the way through.

Glasses with different COE’s will crack during the cooling process.To test the compatibility of two separate glasses, fuse two small pieces of them together and then let them cool. If you notice any cracks or evidence of stress in the glass, you know the two glasses have different COE’s.;
, Make sure the cleaning agent you use is designed specifically for glass. Spray your glass with the cleaner and wipe off any dirt, oil, dust, or residue on the glass with a clean towel. This will prevent your final product from looking spotted or foggy when it comes out of the kiln., Use a small kiln if you’re only planning on doing a few minor fusing projects. If you’re going to be using it a lot and you want to work on several projects at once, consider investing in a larger kiln. Whatever size you choose, make sure it has an accurate temperature monitor on the outside.Opt for a kiln that’s designed specifically for firing glass. If you can’t find a kiln designed for glass, you can use a kiln meant for ceramics, but the results might not be as good., Make sure it can withstand temperatures of up to 1700 degrees Fahrenheit (927 degrees Celsius). The kiln shelf is what you’ll set your glass on when you’re ready to fuse it in the kiln. You can find a kiln shelf online or at your local ceramics store., Your molds should also be able to withstand high temperatures of up to 1700 degrees Fahrenheit (927 degrees Celsius) because you’ll be putting your glass on them and setting them in the kiln.The slumping molds you use will determine the shape of your glass after you fuse it in the kiln. Shop online or in-store to find molds that you like.

, Use a fiber paper that can withstand high temperatures, or use a kiln primer and wash it off after it sets. Apply your glass separator of choice to your kiln shelf and any molds you plan on using so your glass comes off easily., Get a pair of safety glasses and fusing gloves so you don’t injure yourself during the fusing process. Invest in some cheap dust masks to protect your lungs from dangerous dust and glass particles in the air. Shop for these items at your local hardware store or order them online., Use a quality glass cutter that has a comfortable grip. You’ll also need cutting pliers.There are three main types of cutting pliers:


Running pliers. Running pliers are used to apply pressure on the glass so score lines break evenly.Grozing pliers. Grozing pliers are used to chip away pieces of glass that you don’t want before you begin fusing.Breaking pliers. Breaking pliers are used to break glass apart along the lines you’ve scored., Make sure you’re wearing your gloves, goggles, and mask before you start cutting your glass. This will prevent avoidable injuries like cuts and stop pieces of glass from getting into your eyes., Once you know where you want to cut on your piece of glass, roll your glass cutter across the surface of the glass, creating a score line where you want the glass to break apart.Finding the right amount of pressure to use with your glass cutter might take a few tries. Too little pressure will cause the glass to break unevenly, while too much pressure will create chipped edges.Do a couple practice cuts on a spare piece of glass until you get a feel for the tool.

, You can use pliers or your hands to apply the pressure to both sides of the score line. The glass should break in a clean line along the line you scored. Use the same method whether it's a curved or straight line you're running., Cut circles, squares, triangles, or whatever shapes you want to use in your design. Remember that you can stack your glass pieces and fuse them directly on the kiln shelf, or you can lay them over a slumping mold to create a three-dimensional piece., Arrange and stack them however you want them to look once they’re fused. Place the largest piece of glass on the bottom and stack the smaller pieces on top. Use a thin glue to keep your pieces in place if you’re having a hard time., Place the shelf in one of the central slots in the kiln so it’s not too close to the top and not too close to the bottom. Try to leave a ¼ inch (6.35mm) between your glass design on the kiln shelf and the side of the kiln itself so your glass has room to expand., The temperature you use to fire your glass in the kiln depends on the look you’re going for. Decide which kind of fuse -- tack or full -- you want to do. Consult your kiln manual for specific instructions on how to set a firing schedule., With a tack fuse, the edges of the glass will melt and round slightly, but any pieces stacked on top of one another will remain stacked. Fire your kiln to between 1350-1370 degrees Fahrenheit (around 738 degrees Celsius) for this fuse to form., Full-fused pieces have a smooth, flat surface. Program your kiln to reach around 1460-1470 degrees Fahrenheit (around 796 degrees Celsius) to achieve a full fuse., Don’t open the kiln until it’s cooled off below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). Opening the kiln prematurely can cause your glass to break, and you might burn yourself.

, Examine your piece and check for any cracks. If you find cracks, the types of glasses you fused might not have been compatible.

, If you want to fire your fused glass for a second time to make a piece with dimension, place it over one of your molds. Set your glass and the mold on the kiln shelf and place it back in the kiln. Consult your kiln manual and program the kiln to reach around 1225 degrees Fahrenheit (663 degrees Celsius). Let the kiln cool completely before you remove your glass."

Check for seams.,
Inspect the interior.,
Examine the design.,
If you have a pocket UV light, shine it on the glass.",How to Differentiate Pressed from Cut Glass," Glass from a mould often has seams, which show as lines in the finished product. The number of lines depends upon the shape of the finished article & construction of the mould. Depending upon the age of the mould (they wear with use) the pattern may be more or less sharp. In a faceted drop such as a 'crystal', the seam will run all the way around the edge like a ring for poured glass. Although there is nothing to stop pressed glass being cut subsequently the issue is usually: is this design cut or moulded?;
, In poured or pressed glass, the interior of the glass might have have slight dimples that mirror the exterior.

, Hold the glass so that it reflects the light & look, particularly on facets, for fine striations from the tools used on cut glass. These are more obvious on older glass, where polishing was undertaken by hand. However, modern cut glass is chemically smoothed to remove all traces of cutting. This can leave as smooth a finish as good pressed glass. Also, on older cut glass there are often variations in the shape & spacing of the pattern. Not so in pressed glass, where the mould was an expensive item, usually made by craftsmen who perfected the design before it was used.

, If the tint you see is bluish purple, then the glass is lead glass & more likely to be cut. If it is dull green, then it is soda glass, the cheaper type of glass, & more likely to be moulded. Whether a glass design is cut or pressed is not always easy to tell!

Purchase an industrial bottle cutter or sharp precision knife.,
Snugly wrap an industrial hose clamp around the wine bottle to provide a ""tracing"" line.,
Using a sharp, precision knife, score the bottle by following your tracing line.,
Heat the line you scored over a candle.,
Rub an ice cube around the scored line.,
Reheat the bottle and reapply the ice cube if it doesn't work at first.,
Sand away any rough edges before using.",How to Cut Wine Bottles for Crafts2," These are small machines that are made to evenly slice rounded pieces of glass. You likely won't need one for much else than this, but bottle cutters are helpful, cheap tools if you're doing this a lot. Otherwise, a glass cutting knife or sharp, precision blade will do just fine.








, Place it wherever you wish to make the cut, ensuring that it is sitting evenly. This clamp will provide your guidance line when scoring the bottle, like using a ruler to draw a straight line. You could also use a roll of masking tape with the bottle shoved in the center to provide a nice, straight line.








, Follow the line of the clamp to unsure an even cut. Work slowly and methodically.]









You may have to trace out this line 3-4 times to get a nice, deep score. Note that you aren't trying to cut through the bottle, just create a nice, even line.

, Rotate the bottle so that the whole line gets nice and hot. Heat changes cause glass to weaken, and your already scored mark around the bottle will help speed up the process and ensure and even break.









Heat the scored line for about 5-6 seconds.

, You will hear a slow breaking sound as you do. Carefully pull apart the two bottle pieces.








, By the second or third application, the bottle will slide away and you'll be left with two distinct pieces.








, While this method creates a relatively clean break, you can never be too careful. Sand down the rim to get rid of any jagged or rough edges.

Use this method for cutting small pieces of Plexiglass.,
Leave the paper covering on the sheet.,
Lay the sheet (still covered with protective paper) on a flat, even surface.,
Use a yardstick to measure the piece you want to cut.,
Mark the paper.,
Score your mark.,
Position the scored line on the edge of your workbench or table.,
Press down sharply on the scored line.,
Smooth the rough edges.",How to Cut Plexiglass1," (A sheet you can handle easily without any help.)






;
, Plexiglass is hard to break, but it does scratch easily, so Plexiglass sheets are sold with a protective paper covering to protect the surface during transportation.









Leave as much of the paper on the plastic as possible until your cutting project is complete.( When you are ready to completely remove the covering, simply peel and lift 1 corner of the protective paper and pull it off the sheet.)

, If you don’t have a workbench, you can set up 2 or 3 sawhorses. Use enough sawhorses to support the weight of the sheet.








, Don’t use a metal or cloth measuring tape; a yardstick works better with this type of material.








, Use a black marker or a grease pencil to mark off the size of the piece you want to cut.








, Use a glass cutter or the dull side of a box cutter. You need to score the line you want to “cut” because you will actually be snapping the piece off, not cutting it.









Line up your yardstick on the lines you have marked.
Score each line at least 5 times, and as many as 10 times. The deeper you score, the easier the piece will break off. There are several ways to score the plexiglass:
Use a glass cutter.
Use a box cutter (utility knife) with the sharp tip of the blade broken off, or use the back of the knife to do the scoring.
Score the front and the back of the plexiglass to make it easier to snap it off. (Technically, you are not “cutting” the Plexiglass, you are simply making a deep indent so that you can snap off the piece you need.)

, If you have only scored 1 side, place the scored side up so that you can clearly see the line you have marked and scored.








, Use enough pressure to snap the scored piece off. This is sometimes easier if you place a length of wood along the piece and apply the pressure to the wood; the pressure will be more even.








, You will most likely end up with a piece of Plexiglass that has rough edges.









Clamp the piece to a table or workbench.
Use a power saw to smooth the edges. This method works best if your sheet of Plexiglass is at least 1/8” thick (4.57 mm). Position the Plexiglass so that there is just enough overhang to allow for the saw blade’s clearance.
Use a drill with a buffer for thicker pieces of Plexiglass. Coat the buffing pad with a rouge polishing compound before you begin buffing.

"
"
Clamp the sheet of Plexiglass to a table or workbench.,
Measure and mark the piece you want to cut.








,
Keep the sheet firmly against the fence, which must be parallel to your saw blade.








,
Use high speed steel blades.,
Use a coolant when cutting thick pieces.,
Operate your saw at the correct speed.,
Buff the rough edges.",How to Cut Plexiglass2," (Keep the protective paper covering on the sheet.)








,,, Purchase blades that are designed for cutting Plexiglass. If you are cutting more than one sheet at a time, or you are cutting a thick piece of Plexiglass, use a carbide-tipped blade.








, Although a coolant isn’t necessary for sawing most pieces of Plexiglass, using a coolant can give you a much smoother cut.









Combine a few drops of detergent with water in a bottle that has a fine spray mist setting.
Aim the mist against the saw blade. You won’t need to spray the saw blade very much, and probably not at all if you are cutting a small piece.

, The ideal speed for cutting Plexiglass is about 3,450 rpm. The material (Plexiglass sheet) feed rate should be about 4” (10 cm) per second. Keep the speed slow and steady so that you don’t shatter the Plexiglass or cause a jam.








, Use a power saw, wet sander or a drill fitted with a buffer to smooth the edges.

Clean the glass thoroughly with a microfiber cloth.,
Wear protective attire.,
Prepare the workspace.",How to Cut Thick Glass1," It’s crucial that the area where you plan to cut is thoroughly cleaned before you begin. Even tiny dust particles can interrupt the cut and lead to uncontrolled breakage. Wipe the glass down using a quality glass cleaner or rubbing alcohol.Use a microfiber cloth – the tiny fibers can clean even microscopic dirt particles.


Avoid using cotton or nylon cloths on the glass, since these can leave behind large fibers and dust.
Use a clean, dry microfiber cloth to go over the surface once more before you begin. Make surface must be completely dry.;
, During the cutting process, tiny glass shards will be flying through the air at very high speeds. These could potentially get in your eyes or cut your skin. Safety goggles, heavy-duty work gloves and a long-sleeved shirt will protect you. Make sure they are of a high quality. Do not rub your face or eyes while you’re working with glass.


Avoid wearing open-toed shoes and sandals during this project.
Never handle freshly cut glass unless you’re wearing thick gloves. The edges will be extremely sharp., You will need to cut thick glass on a hard, flat surface that is completely free of debris. The work surface needs to be sturdy and, if possible, covered in felt or some other type of soft material. When you start cutting the glass, a great deal of tension will be created – the soft surface will allow the glass to withstand it.


If you don’t have a felted tabletop, cover the work surface with a piece of cardboard. Duct tape it firmly in place.
Keep a small broom and trash can nearby. Cutting will generate glass chips, which can interrupt the accuracy of your cut and damage your tools. You will need to stop periodically during the process to brush them away."
"
Understand the annealing process.,
Begin the annealing process.,
Cool down the glass slowly to where it is below the strain point temperature (η = 1014.5 Poise).,
Prepare and cut the annealed glass after you put on your safety goggles.,
Put your 1/4-inch (0.6 cm) wooden dowel directly under the line you just cut, and apply sharp, sudden pressure on both sides of the dowel.,
Sand the edge of the freshly cut glass with a whetstone.,
Re-temper the glass, if desired.",How to Cut Tempered Glass," This process will uniformly heat up the tempered glass so that all the stresses from the tempering process will be removed. These stress points are the reason that no one can cut tempered glass.;
, Soak the tempered glass at a steady, warm to hot temperature until it reaches the annealing temperature of η = 1013 Poise in a kiln. The soaking time will vary based on the size of the glass you are annealing.


Effetre (Moretti), Bullseye, and Lauscha glasses should be soaked around 940 degrees Fahrenheit (504 degrees Celsius). Borosilicate glass should be at 1,050 degrees Fahrenheit (566 degrees Celsius). Satake tempered glass is best at 890 degrees Fahrenheit (477 degrees Celsius). Small beads require only about 20 minutes of soaking, large beads require 1 hour, and large paperweights can take 12 hours. Very large pieces of glass weighing 100 pounds (45 kg) or more can take months to anneal.

, This must be done slowly enough so that additional stress does not develop. A cooling temperature of 750 degrees Fahrenheit (399 degrees Celsius) for Satake glass and 800 degrees Fahrenheit (427 degrees Celsius) for every thing else works well. Cool in the kiln until the glass is at room temperature.

, Use a straight edge to make your cut line, and keep the straight edge in place along the line. Use your glass cutter to cut along the line, and use medium pressure throughout the entire line to create a scratch. Do not run the glass cutter along the line more than 1 time.

, The glass will now snap at the line into 2 cleanly cut pieces.

, This will make the glass stronger and safer to handle and touch.

, Re-tempering glass is best left to professionals because it is a complex chemical process.

Use a straight edge and grease pencil to mark your cut lines.,
Select a carbide wheel glass cutter to score the surface.,
Use one long, continuous motion to score each line.,
Apply pressure to break the glass along the score lines.",How to Cut Thick Glass2," A clean, successful break depends on precise measurements and accurate cut lines. Use a straight edge to designate where you want the glass to be cut. Use a grease pencil or sharpie to draw the lines on the glass where you want to cut it. The cut lines will be your guide for scoring.


You will use a glass scoring tool to “trace” over the cut lines.
Be sure to your cut lines start at one edge of the glass and end at the another., A glass cutter, also known as a scoring tool, does not break the glass. Instead, it scratches a line into the surface of the glass, weakening it. Once the glass is scored, you can then break it cleanly along the score line. When cutting thick glass, make sure you use a cutter that has a carbide wheel tip.


Steel-wheeled cutters tend to be flimsy in comparison and require lubrication.You can buy glass cutters at any hardware store.

, Grip the handle of the scoring tool firmly and vertically in your hand and place the wheel at the beginning of your first cut line. Line the straight edge up right next to the line for extra support. Using light pressure, run the tool along the line, right next to the straight edge. Make sure you apply equal pressure from the beginning to the end of each score line. Use one even, continuous motion.You will hear a clicking sound as the glass is scored.If you don’t hear it, press down a little harder.

, Place the scored glass on the edge of a hard surface, such as your work station, making sure that the scored edge of the glass is directly aligned with the edge of the counter. Push down quickly on the part of the glass which is hanging off the work station. It should snap off easily and cleanly in your hands. To make a clean break along curved score lines, its best to use a pair of running pliers.

Rent or buy a wet saw at a hardware store.,
Fill the saw’s tray with water.,
Line the wet saw up with your first cut line.,
Turn on the wet saw and cut the glass.",How to Cut Thick Glass3," A wet saw is a motorized saw with a diamond blade that is used to cut tile, glass, porcelain, and other delicate products. During operation, water is sprayed out of the front of the saw to ensure that the blade stays cool and lubricated. Wet saws cut through thick glass very easily. They are a great choice if you plan to cut glass frequently or if you want to avoid the scoring and breaking process.


You must wear safety goggles and heavy-duty work gloves when operating a wet saw. Do not allow anyone in the work area unless they are wearing safety goggles and protective clothing.

, Using a power saw to cut into thick glass is very dangerous without the aid of water, because the glass can get extremely hot and eventually explode. Fill up the saw’s tray completely with water and inspect the saw to make sure nothing is blocking the water flow from the reservoir. Adequate water flow must be maintained during the operation of a wet saw.

, Precise measurements and accurate cut lines are important no matter which cutting technique you employ. After measuring and drawing your cut lines on the surface of the glass with a straight edge and a sharpie, carefully line up the saw’s blade with your first cut line. Make sure that your hands and clothing are well out of the way of the blade before you turn it on.

, Using light pressure, gently push the glass towards the wet saw. Do not push the blade into the glass, as this will result in a messy cut. Push the glass slowly, lightly and steadily against the blade. Continue until the blade has cut the glass along the entirety of the cut line you drew on the glass.


Move onto the next cut line and continue.
Turn off the wet saw when you’ve finished with the job and empty the water from the saw’s tray.

Reduce the pressure when you reach the end of the line you want to cut.

,
Place your glass cutter on the table.,
Place a thumb on either side of the scored line.,
Apply upward pressure with your index fingers at the bottom of the glass.",How to Cut Glass for Crafts1," A glass cutter is a small, hand-held tool that scores the glass with a sharp wheel.;
, Clean a flat surface and place a chair nearby. Keep a straight edge and sharpie on hand to help you get an accurate cut in the glass.

, You should always wear goggles when cutting glass, because an unclean break can launch shards of glass into the air.

, You should do 10 to 20 practice cuts before starting to craft your glass for the final project.


Antique glass is hand-blown and often has some bubbles inside. It is uneven and unlikely to cut well. Antique glass is also more expensive, so make sure you choose glass that is not valuable for your first glass crafts.

, You can also place the straight edge where you want to cut, if you want to avoid making a mark on your glass.

, Stand in a place where you can apply steady downward pressure.

, Apply firm pressure slowly towards you. The base of the cutter should be parallel to the glass rather than slanted.


You should hear the sound of the glass being scored. It will not cut all the way through the glass, but rather, it will make marks in the surface.

,, Pick up your piece of glass.

, Your fingers should wrap around on the other side in a loose fist shape.

, Give the same amount of pressure on both sides of the score line. Your glass should snap in half cleanly.


For thicker pieces of glass, you can use glass breaking/grozing pliers. These strong pliers have a flat side and a curved side for breaking and then nipping off shards of unevenly broken glass. Place the flat side of the pliers on the smaller piece of glass and thrust upwards while you hold the rest of the glass with your opposite hand.

Select a sturdy uncut mirror for your project.,
Clean and dry the mirror thoroughly.,
Wear protective gear.",How to Cut Mirror1," If you want to custom cut a mirror, almost any piece will do – you can purchase uncut mirror glass from a hardware store or repurpose something you already have. Avoid cutting mirrors that are already severely chipped or cracked in multiple places. A mirror in bad condition may not be able to withstand the cutting process and shatter while you’re working with it.


If you’re looking for another source to buy uncut mirror, look for specialty shops that deal specifically in mirror and glass.
It may be helpful to purchase a few pieces of inexpensive mirror to practice on. Try single-strength window glass, since it is easier to cut and usually the least expensive.;
, Use glass cleaner or rubbing alcohol and a microfiber cloth to wipe down the mirror’s surface. Clean it thoroughly – you need it to be as spotless as possible, because even the slightest speck of dirt or dust can cause interruptions during the scoring process. This may result in the glass chipping or breaking.Use another microfiber cloth to wipe the surface down once more to ensure the mirror is completely dry before you begin.

, During the scoring and breaking process, tiny shards of glass will be discharged. These could potentially get into your eyes. It’s very important to wear some kind of eye protection or safety goggles when you’re working with glass. Don’t rub or touch your eye area while you’re working. Wear protective gloves, especially when handling freshly cut glass – the edges will be very sharp.Avoid wearing open-toed shoes or sandals.
If you end up with a glass splinter, try to remove it by placing a sticky piece of tape over it and then whipping it off quickly. If that doesn’t work, use tweezers.

Enjoy your cleanly broken bottle.",How to Cut a Glass Bottle1," To create the line that the bottle will break off at, use a glass cutter or a glass drill bit to score a line. If you want, you can use a support system so that you get a perfect line around the bottle, otherwise you can just freehand it.






;
, Heat the line that you made with the glass cutter. You can use a small candle or a small butane torch. Focus the heat directly along the score line, and constantly rotate the bottle to get even coverage.








, When you have spent around 5 minutes heating the bottle, dip the end you are breaking off in cold water. Do this in a sink or pot full of cold water, with optional ice.








, The bottle might require more stress than a single round of heating and cooling in order to break. Simply repeat the process of heating the bottle and dipping it in cold water until it snaps.








, Use a rough square of sandpaper to clean off the edges of the glass. As you remove any sharp points, alternate to a finer grit sandpaper. You should do this as soon as you are finished, to avoid cutting yourself.








, Use the bottle to store pens, drink out of, or make a pretty vase. The options are endless!

, Ball began using block letters for the logo on their jars in 1892, and continued using this type of logo until 1896. The major difference between the lettering on these jars and newer jars is the lettering on the older jars is simple printing rather than cursive or stylized lettering., In 1895, Ball introduced their first logo that used cursive lettering. This is also when Ball began underlining their logo. Between 1895 and 1896, the Ball logo was relatively straight rather than angled toward the upper right side of the jar.

, The Ball logo has remained relatively standard since the first script logo was introduced, but there have been a number of small variations that can be used to date the jar. The 3-L logo, for instance, was only used between 1900 and 1910.


This logo is called the 3-L logo because the decorative loop at the end of the logo looks like a third L in the Ball name., Between 1910 and 1923, the A in the word Ball had an ascender at the beginning that looked like it should connect with the B. Because the B and the A don’t connect, this called the dropped A.


At this time, Ball also adopted the 2-L style logo, where the decorative loop on the end of the name was dropped.

, The cursive word “Ball” without the underscore was only produced between 1923 and 1933.

, This moves into the 1933 to 1962 age range. There is an underscore, a “B” with a loop in the center and a very small “a.”

, Starting in the 1960s, the lower part of the “B” connected to the underline. This indicates a date range between 1960 and today., Ball mason jars with Christmas lettering have a unique design that doesn’t use their original printed or their traditional cursive lettering. Instead, the lettering is calligraphy, and the jar reads “Masons Patent.”


These Ball mason jars were manufactured in 1890., Over the years, Ball has introduced a variety of different jars that can be identified with certain words that are printed on the jars. Some of these words were used for many years, but the style often changed every couple years.


“Improved:” There were a few times when Ball produced jars with “Improved,” including in the 1890s, when the jars were printed with “Ball Improved 1858.” Later, the jars were produced with the wording “Ball Mason Improved” between 1900 and 1933.
“Special:” Between 1910 and 1913, Ball mason jars were printed with the words “Ball Special Mason” in all block letters.
“Perfect:” Between 1913 and 1922, the word “Perfect” was slightly offset, and is left indented from the word “Mason” below.“Sanitary:” This word was printed on Ball mason jars around 1913 and 1915 to indicate that they had the sanitary sure seal. The word “Sanitary” is in all capital letters, is italicized, and appears below the Ball logo.
“Ideal”: These were made between 1915 and 1962.
“Square:” Jars with the word “Square” were produced in 1925.
“Eclipse:” These wide-mouthed jars were made between 1926 and 1952.

, There are a few oddly sized Ball mason jars that were produced at very specific times, so the size of the jar can be used to date its production.


In the 1920s and early 1930s, Ball produced 40-ounce (1.2-L) jars that were used for coffee, and 42-ounce (1.24-L) jars that were popular with bootleggers.To measure the capacity of your jar, fill it with water and then measure the amount of water the jar holds.

, Ball created a number of colored mason jars over the years, and while the most common is blue, there were also jars produced in other colors as well, such as green and yellow.


Blue glass Ball jars were produced in the late 1890s and early 1900s, but the company stopped producing these in 1937.
There were also some brown amber jars produced in the 1950s, but most of the jars produced after the 1940s were made of clear glass., There have been a number of mason jars produced over the years that have spelling errors and other mistakes printed on the jars, and these can be compared with reference materials to date the jars. If you find a jar with an error, find a copy of the Redbook (a price guide for fruit jar collectors) to determine the age and price of the jar based on the error.One of the most common error jars is a Ball jar with a misspelling of the word “Perfect,” and common variations include “perffct,” “peprect,” and “perefct.”

, Ball jars that have an upside-down logo are actually upside-down jars that were designed to function as coffee dispensers. These were manufactured between 1900 and 1910., Ball mason jars were produced for many years with the year 1858 printed on them, but this is no indication of the age of jar itself. Rather, 1858 is the year that John Mason was granted a patent for his mason jar design, and the Ball company used this patent year on many jars., This was another patent date that was printed on many mason jars, and that has no bearing on the year of production. In fact, Ball used this patent date on their jars well into the 1930s, so this year cannot be used to accurately date a Ball jar., Many Ball mason jars have a number printed on the bottom of the jar, but this is a mold number that does not indicate the year of production. Rather, the mold number tells you where the jar was positioned on the glass-making machine that was used to produce it.


Mold numbers are generally a number between zero and 15, and they’ll sometimes have a letter included as well."

Choose a quality glass scoring tool that meets your needs.Most scoring tools feature a carbide cutting wheel on the end, which scratches the glass, and it is attached to some kind of handle.,
Select a scoring tool that can best handle your design.,
Measure and mark your cut lines with a straight edge.,
Place your scoring tool at the beginning of your first cut line.,
Apply a slight downward pressure while rolling the tool along the line.,
Score the remaining cut lines.",How to Cut Mirror2," These tools are sometimes referred to as wheel-cutters. The wheels come in different diameters, with the smallest ones being best for detailed work. Wheel-cutters are relatively inexpensive, so it’s worth it to get one of higher quality.


Look for scoring tools that have a sturdy design and a true carbide wheel. The cheaper tools can cost as little as five dollars. Those of higher quality are usually closer to twenty.
You can get glass scoring tools at craft shops and hardware stores. Hardware stores usually carry the more expensive, sturdier models.

, Some scoring tools are meant to score straight lines and others will score curved lines. Select your tool according to the design you have in mind for your mirror.The different handle shapes offer a variety grips. Choose what’s most comfortable for you to hold.


If you have a very small job to do, look for a steel-wheel cutter. They work as well as the carbide wheels, and are even cheaper.
If you are looking to cut a lot of mirror, invest in the self-oiling mirror cutter. It can last longer than other cutters, and is usually easier to use.

, To make a clean break, your measurements and cut lines need to be as precise as possible. Use a straight edge to mark your cut lines on the mirror’s surface. Mark the cut line with a sharpie or white crayon. The cut line will be your guide so that you can accurately run the scoring tool over it in one continuous motion.


The cleanest break lines will be created when you score with one continuous motion of the tool.Always mark your score lines starting at one edge of the glass and ending at the other., Put your mirror on a hard, flat surface that is free of debris. Hold the scoring tool vertically in your hand and line the wheel up at the beginning of your first cut line. Place the straight edge right beside the line so you can score along right next to it. This will give you the straightest, most accurate results.


You can run the scoring tool along the line toward you or away from you. Try both ways to find out which you feel most comfortable with.If you’re concerned that your straight edge might wiggle around while you’re scoring, try using a simple clamp to hold it firmly in place. , With most mirrors, you should hear a screeching sound if you are doing it correctly. If you don't hear that sound, you aren't pressing down hard enough. If you press too hard, you will notice tiny chips collecting around the score. These may get under your wheel and damage or dull your cutter, so brush them away immediately if you see them.


Try to apply an equal amount of pressure for the duration of the score.Avoid lifting your tool up during the process so that you can score the line in one continuous motion., Continue scoring the mirror until you have completely outlined your intended design. Stop every other score or so to brush away glass shards that have collected on the mirror’s surface and on your work surface. Leaving glass chips around while you’re in the midst of scoring can interrupt the accuracy of your cut lines and damage the carbide wheel on your scoring tool.For best results, try to keep your work space as debris-free as possible throughout the process.

Use your hands to break a small mirror down the scored line.There are a number of ways to cleanly break the mirror.,
Snap larger score lines by applying pressure on a flat surface.Place the mirror, scored-side down, on a soft and flat surface.,
Break the glass along the score line with running pliers.,
Use running pliers and a springy surface to break curved score lines.,
Sand and seal the edges of your newly cut mirror (optional).",How to Cut Mirror3," One of the easiest ways is with your hands, although it’s not always the most ideal, especially if you are working with a very large piece of mirror. If the mirror is small enough for you to hold, firmly grasp it in both hands and place one thumb on each side of the first score line. Press down with both thumbs simultaneously, taking care to do so with equal pressure.Quickly make a snapping motion with your wrists and the mirror should break crisply along the score line.
Always wear protective gloves when you’re breaking glass. The score lines render the glass unstable and sometimes it can shatter in ways you aren’t expecting.

, Use your hands to press down on the unscored side, applying pressure along the score line. The glass should cleanly snap. You can also place the mirror on the edge of a flat surface, making sure to line up the score line with the edge. Use your hand to press down on the side of the glass that is hanging over the edge until you see the glass snap crisply., If you feel uncomfortable breaking the mirror with your hands, or if the piece of glass is too large to do it that way, use running pliers. Place them so the bottom jaw touches the score on your mirror. The top jaw should touch the mirror about 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) on either side of the score line. Squeeze the pliers, which will cause them to separate, and the pressure will widen the score line. This widening will cause the score to crack along the rest of your line in a very controlled breaking pattern.If you’re breaking a long score line, you might want to apply the pliers gently at one end, until you hear a very faint clicking sound. Then turn the mirror around and do the same thing on the other end of the line. This will cleanly complete the break at the edges.

, For scores that have multiple curves, turn the mirror upside down on a springy surface, such as a piece of foam or cardboard. If the curve isn't very dramatic, press down on the score line with your thumb, which will cause the break. However, running pliers are the best to use on curves and semi-circles. If you're cutting mirror with lots of curves, invest in running pliers and the breaking process will go much more smoothly.

, If you’re placing your mirror in a frame so that the raw edges won’t be visible, this is probably unnecessary (although you can still do it if you like). Sand down the edges with sandpaper, then apply mirror edge sealant or some other hermetic coating to the edges. You can find these materials at any hardware store. You can also use clear fingernail polish and get similar results."

Score the bottle.,
Get the water ready.,
Pour the hot water.,
Move the bottle into the cold water.,
Continue adding hot and cold water.,
Sand the edges.",How to Cut a Glass Bottle2," You need to create a tension line for the bottle to crack along, and you do this by scoring a clean line at the desired breaking point. Use a glass cutter or a glass drill bit to create a single, even line wrapping around the glass. Don’t overlap score lines, as this will make your cut more jagged than a single line.








, You will need to be working at a sink with cold water running, and also boil a teakettle of hot water. The process works by pouring boiling and cold water back and forth over the bottle until it snaps at the score line.








, Hold the bottle over the sink, and slowly pour the hot water over the score line. Avoid pouring it in a wide area, as you want only the score line to be placed under tension from the heat.








, As you finish pouring hot water over the entire line around the bottle, put it under the cold water running in the sink. The first time you do this, the bottle likely will not break.








, Take the bottle from the cold water and add another pour of the boiling water over the stress line. Pour the water around the entire bottle, and then dip it in the cold water again. After the second or third time of doing this, the bottle should snap cleanly off along the score line.








, Use a rough grit of sandpaper to sand the edges of the glass down. When they are no longer jagged at all, you can use a fine grit sandpaper to smooth the edges to a soft finish.

Wrap your yarn.,
Soak the yarn in acetone.,
Wrap the bottle again.,
Light the yarn on fire.,
Dunk the bottle in cold water.,
Sand the edges.",How to Cut a Glass Bottle3," If you don’t have yarn available, you can use any thick cotton string. At the location of where you would like the bottle to break, wrap a piece of yarn around the bottle 3-5 times. Tie the ends together and cut off any excess string.








, Slide the yarn off the end of the bottle, and place it in a small dish or lid. Pour a bit of nail polish remover or straight-up acetone over the yarn until it is completely soaked. You can pour the excess acetone back into the bottle afterwards.








, Take the yarn and replace it back on the bottle in the exact location you want it to break. Try to make sure that the loops of yarn are placed close together and are tight so that you get a level, clean break.








, Use a match or a lighter to catch the yarn (on the bottle) on fire. Rotate the bottle slowly so that the yarn burns at a consistent speed around the entire bottle.








, Have your sink or a pot filled with cold water - you can add ice as well if you would like. Wait until the fire on the yarn has burnt out, and then stick the end of the bottle with the yarn directly into the water. The bottle should break cleanly off where the yarn was wrapped around it.








, Use a rough sandpaper to smooth down the jagged edges on the broken section of the bottle. When you have removed any sharp corners, switch to a fine grit sandpaper to give the bottle a smooth, soft finish. You’re done!







"
"
Mask off the bottle.,
Cut the bottle.,
Sand the edges.",How to Cut a Glass Bottle4," The dremel will be doing all the cutting in this method, but you need to know where to cut. Use two strips of masking tape placed very close together (but not touching!) to form a thin line around the bottle where you want to cut.








, Attach a glass-cutting bit to the end of the dremel. Work your way around, slowly cutting the glass along the taped line. You may have to go over the same section multiple times in order to get a clean cut.








, When the bottle snaps along the line, you will probably have some jagged edges that need smoothing. Use a rough grit of sandpaper to smooth down the sharp pieces, and then transition into using a fine grit to make a soft surface. You're finished!

Flip the glass over and gently press on the center of your score from the backside.,
Make some relief cuts to remove small pieces at a time instead of all at once.,
Smooth your curved edges using a glass router.",How to Cut Glass," You'll need a large flat surface, preferably one that is slightly soft and won't scratch your glass. Work in an area that is easy to clean.









Avoid working over carpet because of the risk of getting glass shards on the floor if the glass breaks.
For their own safety keep pets and children away from your workspace and materials.;
, Any grime or silica on the glass can ruin your score. Wipe these away by running a cloth or your finger along the surface of the glass where you plan to score.








, Glass cutters are about the size of a pencil and use a diamond or a hardened wheel to mark a score into glass so that it can be broken cleanly along a line. You can buy cutting oil at a stained glass store or use a small amount of kerosene.








, The score must run from one edge of the glass to the other edge. You can write on the glass with a marker (preferably with a straight edge, if you are cutting a straight line. You can also mark on paper and place the glass on top of the paper.









Cut should not be very long. Scores longer than two feet have a high failure rate when breaking.
Make sure your marks leave about six inches of glass on each side to grip and break. If you cut smaller pieces, you may need to use special tools, like pliers or a light hammer, to break off glass you can't get a hold of.

, An oiled cutter creates a smoother score line. Make sure to look at the wheel and make sure it is lined up the way you want the glass to cut.








, Use a yardstick or a normal desk ruler. You need something that has a thick enough profile that it won't conflict with the wheel on the cutter.








, Listen for a smooth sound like ripping silk. A gritty sound means that you are pushing too hard or that you did not oil your cutter. The less sound you make, the better your score will be.









If you push too hard (a very common mistake), your cut gets ""hot,"" meaning that it snaps and pops.
You are aiming to get a uniform score. If you are pressing too hard in one spot and perfectly in another, the glass will not break the way that you want it to. Microscopic imperfections in your score will cause your cut to go askew.

, Do not run back and forth over the line if you miss a spot.








, You want a score that is not popping and is barely visible, if you were to wipe the oil away. It should look like a small scratch, nothing more. Make sure it runs completely from one edge to the other.








, Hold the glass as if you were trying to break a potato chip in half with two hands.








, Your elbows do not move. Simply twist your wrists (your right wrist will turn clockwise and your left will turn counterclockwise). Imagine that the score you made is half the depth of the glass and now you need to ""open it up"" by using the score as a weak spot. You're done as soon as you have two pieces of glass instead of the one you started with.









When the glass breaks, it may simply start as a ""run."" If it only runs an inch or so, apply a little more twisting pressure and it will continue to run.

, This edge will be where the vertical edge meets the horizontal surfaces. Not only does sanding reduce the chances of your being cut, but sanded glass is less likely to chip along the edges and has some added strength.








, If you are cutting a freehand shape, make sure you are breaking along lines that run from edge to edge. Mark your lines with a marker or set your glass over your pattern.








, You should be able to score along gentle curves normally with a steady hand. For tighter curves, make a series of marks that run along part of the curve and skew off at a tangent outside the piece you want.








, You will start a run this way. Follow the run with light pressure and you can watch the glass separate where you scored it. If your score is too close to the edge of a piece of glass, it may run to the edge instead of along your score because that is the easiest path for the run to take.








, The smaller the relief cuts, the more accurate your cut will be. Grip smaller pieces with pliers to snap them off.








, This machine uses a spinning wheel with fine diamond chips as a grinder. Turn on the router and press your curve firmly against the grinder to smooth out your curve, then sand as normal.

If this is uncomfortable or difficult for you, hold it like you would hold a pen or pencil. There is no right or wrong way to hold the cutter; find something that is comfortable for you., A score line is the cut that is made in the glass. Hold the cutter perpendicular to the surface of the glass and push or pull along the surface to create the cut. Practice cutting with enough pressure that you hear a “zip” sound as you use the cutter on the glass surface.

, Using cheap glass, practice scoring the glass with your cutter several times, taking care not to go over any previous score lines. It will take some practice and experimentation to get this right.


Without enough pressure on the cutter, the sheet glass will not break.
The glass won’t break cleanly with too much pressure.

, Soak the glass jar or bottle in warm soapy water to remove the label and then wash the bottle or jar inside and out.

Rinse with clean water and dry. You may want to allow the jar/bottle to air dry especially if you are working with a narrow bottle. Don’t start your project until the bottle/jar is completely dry.

, You'll need several bottles of food coloring as you will need to immerse the glass in plenty of coloring in order to obtain a more vibrant tint. Check ""Things You'll Need"" below for the remaining items needed to complete this project.

Anneal in order to cool off.",How to Blow Glass1," With a hollow steel tube, or blowpipe, gather the glass from the furnace (the oven where molten glass is kept). The molten glass in the furnace should be about 2,025 to 2,125 °F (1,107 to 1,163 °C).


A simple but accurate analogy is turning caramel onto an apple. Think of your steel rod as the apple and the furnace as the pot of caramel. Just as you slowly rotate the apple in the hot caramel, gathering glass requires continuous rotation of your steel rod in the furnace, in order to gather the glass steadily and evenly.;
, Once the glass is stable, carry it to a steel table, called a marver, and begin shaping it. Glass shaping begins with rolling the hot glass on a marver. It is important to make sure that your cylinder is symmetrical. Once you’ve achieved your cylinder, continue to rotate the blowpipe, to prevent the glass from dripping off.


The marver will suck a lot of heat from the molten glass because the surfaces of the two materials actually touch as the glass rolls across the marver.
If the sides of the glass get too thin, chill them by rolling them on the marver.
If the bottom of the glass gets too thick, introduce the glass back into the glory hole (the oven that reheats the glass to keep it malleable) and concentrate the heat on the bottom of the glass. Turn constantly as you heat the glass.

, Blow into the pipe then cover the hole with your thumb. The positive pressure will cause the trapped air to expand inside the pipe, which in turn will create a bubble. This first gather and bubble is called the parison.


Once you have an even-walled bubble, you may again marver and gather more glass. Remember to rotate the rod continuously as you move from the marver to the furnace and glory hole.

, Collect more glass around your bubble. The number of gathers you make depends upon how big you would like your piece to be — bigger pieces require more gathers.


If you wanted a bit of color, now might be a good time to introduce it onto your cooler post.

, When you are done with your gathers, use a soaked newspaper and with it shape your parison into a bullet. Then reheat it in the glory hole. Remember to keep the rod rotating at all times!

, Shape your piece by rolling it on the marver, while an assistant blows air through the pipe and into the glass.


If you want the bubble to move down the glass, marver the sides and not the bottom. With the sides cooler, the bubble will push the bottom down even further when you blow on it.
If you want the bubble to move out the glass so that the sides expand, marver the bottom and not the sides. With the bottom cooler, the bubble will push the sides out even further when you blow on it.

, Once your piece is shaped you cut in, or create score lines in the piece’s neck with large tongs known as jacks. The neck should be equal to or less than the diameter of your blow-pipe. Keep rotating your pipe!

, This requires you to transfer your piece to another rod called a punty. It’s one of the trickier parts of glass blowing. A little trade secret, however makes it a whole lot easier. Find a small tool (a file is best) and dip it in water. Carefully etch a line around the neck. This weakens the glass and makes it brittle. It then easily separates from the original pipe.

, Place your thumb over the hole though which you were blowing and then carefully dip the pipe into a bucket of water, all the while keeping your thumb over the blow hole to stop the water from shooting up the pipe and ruining it.

, Reheat the glass in the glory hole and trim the lip with shears.

, Using a wooden block, tap the pipe forcefully, your piece should drop off the end of the pipe.

, Carefully carry it over to the annealer (an oven that cools glass at a controlled rate) and leave it to cool overnight.

, Be careful when handling the glass, so that you do not accidentally drop or break it.

, Use a marker to draw the line where you intend to cut the glass. There are plenty of markers available that are designed for writing on glass that you can use for this purpose.Use a ruler to help you draw a line that is perfectly straight by placing the ruler right next to the pen as you draw.

, Lubricating the cutter will prevent the blade from dulling and make scoring the glass easier. Be sure to dip the cutter in oil before each cut.


Oils traditionally used for glass cutters are kerosene oil, motor oil, and lamp oil; however, any type of oil could work. You could also use coconut oil, olive oil, or avocado oil. It is completely up to you!, Scoring means slicing the glass with the cutter. Hold the cutter perpendicular to the surface of the glass and slide it firmly along the cut line. Use enough pressure to make a line but not so much that you leave a white residue (which means the glass won’t break cleanly). You will know that you are using the right amount of pressure if you hear a “zip” sound as you cut. It will help to practice making cuts on cheap sheet glass first.You do not need to cut the score line very deep. Using too much pressure could prevent the glass from breaking evenly.
Be sure to cut from one edge to the other. It is not possible to break the glass evenly if the cut is not from edge to edge.
Do not cut over a previously cut score line if you make a mistake. You will need to cut another score line. Doing so will ruin your cutter., Line up the score line with the edge of the table. The largest piece of glass should rest on the table and the smaller piece should be off the table.

, For large pieces of glass, lift the glass one to two inches off the edge of the table and then bring down firmly with both hands. The glass piece should break off against the edge of the table.


The larger piece should be on the table and the smaller piece in your hands.

, For medium sheets of glass that can hold in your hands, you may be able to simply bend the glass in each hand until it breaks and you are holding a piece in both hands.

, For small pieces of glass, use pliers instead of your hands to break off the glass. Hold the largest piece of glass with your non-dominant hand and use your dominant hand to grip the pliers.


Position the pliers in the center of the glass, running parallel to the score line.
Using the pliers, push down on the smallest piece of glass, as if you are making a folding motion along the score line.
The glass should break off cleanly.

, Handle the glass carefully so that you do not accidentally drop or break it.

, Use a marker to draw where you intend to cut the glass.

, Lubricating the cutter will prevent the blade from dulling and make scoring the glass easier. Be sure to dip the cutter in oil before each cut. You can use any oil that you are comfortable with using!

, Use the cutter to cut the glass by holding it perpendicular to the glass and slicing it firmly.


For curvy lines, you can score the glass by pulling the cutter toward you or pushing it away from you as you make the cut. It is recommended that you push it away from you so that you can see the line you are cutting at all times. Do what is most comfortable to you.
Be sure to cut from one edge to the other. It is not possible to break the glass cleanly and evenly if the cut is not from edge to edge.

, Now that you have made the cut, hold the glass up and use the steel ball on the non-cutting end of your glass cutter to tap firmly along the length of the score.


The score should be facing you for this step.
If the score line becomes brighter, it is due to the internal cracking of the glass and means that you are successful.
The glass may spontaneously separate after one or two taps. Be prepared for this by holding the glass with your free hand on either side of the score., Hold the glass with each hand on either side of the score line. The side of the glass that is opposite your hands should rest on the table.


For small pieces of glass, use pliers to separate the pieces.
If you are using your hands, place your thumbs parallel to the score line and curl your fingers under your thumbs, beneath the glass.
Fold along the score line but do not yet break it. Do this along the length of the score line. This will loosen up the score line even more.
Turn the sheet 180 degrees and repeat the folding motion until you feel the pieces loosening.
Separate the pieces with a downward motion.
Curved lines can be more difficult to break than straight lines. If it doesn’t break as you are tapping, it may take some extra effort to separate the pieces.

Take the mandrel out of the flame and shape, as necessary, with a graphite paddle.,
Allow the mandrel to cool off a bit before taking it to the annealer, rotating all the while.

",How to Blow Glass2," Lampworking is the process of manipulating molten glass over a small torch. Lampworking is used to create beads, for example, or other smaller objects, like paperweights. This section will focus on how to lampwork a small bead.

, You could use an oxygen and propane fed torch if you have access to one.

, Try to get a stainless steel mandrel with a ceramic coating. The ceramic coating will keep the molten glass from sticking to the mandrel when you want to take it off.

, If you don't flash the glass, it could go into shock and shatter instead of becoming molten. Flash for about 30 seconds.

, Hold it in the flame until a nice orange ball develops.


Keep rotating your glass so that it maintains its round shape.

,


Place the glass onto the mandrel and begin wrapping the mandrel away from your body. Wrap until you have full coverage on your mandrel.
Use the torch flame to sever the glass rod from the mandrel. It's easiest to cut the glass away from its source when both it and the mandrel are in the flame.

,


If desired, add another color to the existing bead. Do this by following Steps #4 through #7, all while rotating the mandrel and occasionally dipping it back into the flame. This is not for beginners, as it requires dexterity and use of both hands simultaneously.

, Use the paddle to:


Create better edges
Create square shapes
Help even out the contours of a curve.

You are going to need a business license. Visit your city’s web site or go to your city office and obtain the criteria package and application for a business license. A basic business license is generally very inexpensive. Each year, at the anniversary of your business license renewal time, your city may require a report from you that will determine the renewal fee.
Depending on the types of products you make, your city may require a fire permit. This may lead to an inspection of your home and the area of your home in which you work.
Resale license or Use permit. If you live in a state that collects sales tax, and you intend to sell your products to the general public, you will need a Seller’s Permit or Resale License. Visit your state’s web site or call your State Board of Equalization for an application. There is usually no fee for a resale license; however, (depending on your state’s guidelines) you will be required to submit quarterly and annual reports that will determine the payment you will make to the state.









;
, Establish a business relationship with manufacturers and/or wholesale dealers and distributors of the raw materials you use (fabrics, yarns, paints, floral products, canvas, hand tools or power tools, baskets, new or used widgets, paper, etc.). Buying direct from manufacturers and wholesale dealers requires a business license and a sales permit. (Where do you find these businesses? Google will become your best business partner. Simply type in what you’re looking for: such as – Wholesale Crafting materials, or Silk Flower distributors, or Textile Manufacturers, etc. There are thousands of them out there.)








,
Are you going to do this yourself? If so, good for you! If you are familiar with keeping books (even at a minimal level) invest in basic bookkeeping software that you can rely upon to provide the information you want and need. Select a product that will monitor not only your sales and the bank balance, but your costs and inventory status, too. (Consult with your tax preparer for a product that is best suited for your needs.)
If you’re not so good at bookkeeping or you just don’t want to do this, the best investment you can make for your business is a good bookkeeper. Set up an ""Informational Interview"" with your personal tax preparer or CPA for guidance on finding a good bookkeeper (he/she might offer this service himself/herself).
Take a basic bookkeeping class. Even if you opt to have your CPA or tax preparer handle the books for you, you will want and need to have some understanding of your financial position. Check with your local community college or adult education center for a class schedule. (And, yes, there is a book distributed by Wiley Publishing ""Bookkeeping for Dummies"" by Lita Epstein. Look for it online or at an office supply store.)










, If you are already in the work force, stay there. Until you have solid income that you can depend on from your crafting, don’t bite the hand that feeds you. If you are fortunate to have a financial reserve or a source of funds that will sustain your living expenses and allow you to lay out money for materials and craft-related expenses until you have an inventory base, congratulations! You are among a very small group.








, Do you have work space in your home or garage where you can work uninterrupted and your crafting work will not take over your entire home? Segregate your work area from your living space. If you are truly going to make crafting your ""business,"" maintain your personal life, then ""go to work"" as you would if you were going outside your home. Take lunch. Take breaks.








, Whether you plan to sell your crafted creations out of your home, online, at craft fairs, community farmer’s markets or at a yard sale, you need enough inventory stock to attract customers. Do you plan to consign your items? Meet with a retailer that accepts consignment items. Present samples of your craft item(s). The retailer might accept one piece or a dozen. Be prepared to fill the order.








, Join an existing crafter’s group or club, or start your own. There are literally thousands and thousands of people just like us who would love to exchange ideas, share a customer base, band together in your own community to have a craft fair of your own.

Find clear glass that you would like to color.,
Clean and dry your glass.,
Purchase glass paint in the color of your choice.,
Buy acetone-based nail polish remover.,
Cover your work area with newspapers or paper bags.

,
Mix 1 tsp.,
Pour the mixed paint into the interior of the bottle or vase.,
Pour out excess glass paint from the bottle after you have coated the interior or exterior surface.,
Set the glass aside to dry for 3 to 7 days.",How to Dye Glass1," These methods don’t work for dyeing glass surfaces that are used for eating. However, you can dye the opposite side of serving trays, pitchers and decanters that can be washed by hand.;
, Use a dishwasher if possible, to ensure all dirt and grime is removed. If you are using a thin bottle, you may need to soak the bottle in soapy water before rinsing.


A decanter or bottle cleaning brush will reach into the bottle to remove food or grease residue. They are available online and in kitchen stores.

, You can find glass paint at large craft stores and online.

, It is available in most drug stores. You can also purchase acetone at some craft stores since it is used as paint thinner.

,, (4.9 ml) of glass paint with 1/4 tsp. (1.2 ml) of acetone in a small plastic bowl. Mix together with a paintbrush. The acetone is used to thin the paint, so increase the amount of glass paint or paint thinner, depending upon the color you would like to achieve.


Remember that the glass paint will dry lighter than it appears at the start. Increase the paint thinner to dye the glass a subtle shade.
The amount you need is commensurate with the size of the project. Increase the amount of paint and acetone if it is a large project.
If you are dyeing a glass bottle, you can pour the glass paint and acetone directly into the interior of the bottle and mix it by shaking.

, Paint it onto the underside or outside of a bottle or tray if it will be used for serving food. Use a paintbrush to distribute the dye evenly.


Dyeing the outside of the surface can make it slightly tacky to the touch. It is recommended for surfaces that don’t have to be used or washed too often.
Swirl the paint around the interior of the bottle until it covers the entire area. Roll it around on a surface or turn it in the air slowly to coat the surface.
If your paint doesn’t seem to be distributing in an even coat, you have used too much acetone. Add more paint to the interior and mix again.

, Some accumulation will drip down into the bottom, but you want to avoid pools of glass paint.

, Allow the paint to cure for a week before pouring water into it."

Follow safety precautions.,
Find a heat-proof structure with the desired angle.,
Turn a Bunsen burner on medium or high.,
Lower the glass slowly into the flame at the desired bend point.,
Rotate the glass as you heat.,
Bend the hot glass around the heat-proof object.,
Reduce airflow to the burner.,
Hold the bend over the flame for two or three minutes.,
Let the glass cool.",How to Bend Glass1," Wear safety glasses whenever handling hot glass. You should only try this with long pieces of glass, which you can safely hold without putting your hands anywhere near the flame. Hold hot glass using both hands, with each hand on an opposite end of the rod.









For short pieces of glass, clamp the glass to a ring stand or light vise, and use a torch instead of a Bunsen burner. Follow these instructions, but instead of rotating the glass, rotate the torch completely around the point you want to bend, as you heat it.Keep a container of water or a fire extinguisher nearby, just in case.;
, For a 90º (right angle) bend, you can use the base of a ring stand, available from laboratory supply stores. For other angles, you may need to create this yourself by clamping and bending a piece of sturdy sheet metal.









If you don't mind imprecise angles, you may skip this step and bend the glass by hand once it is hot, grasping only the two cool ends.

, Attach the burner to a gas source, open the valve on the source and the base of the burner, then light the flame using a lighter or torch. Adjust the air flow valve on the side of the burner until the burner produces a tall, blue flame.









Ideally, use a ""wing top"" burner attachment to create a wider flame, for a smoother bend.These are sometimes called ""fishtail burners.""
If you are using glass ""stringers,"" or small glass rods less than 2mm (0.08 inches) thick, you can use a candle flame instead.

, Always begin applying heat slowly, or the glass will have a high risk of cracking.







, Hold the glass so the point where the bend will occur is directly in the tip of the blue flame. Rotate the glass slowly and constantly, and move it from side to side to heat approximately 5 cm (2 in.) of its length.Heat until you feel or see the glass begin to sag at that point.








, If heated sufficiently, the glass should easily bend at that point. Bend it around the heat-proof structure with the angle you require. Make sure to hold the glass flat and steady during this bend.








, Tighten the air intake valve on the side of the Bunsen burner, until the outtake cools to a single, thin flame with no hot, inner cone visible.








, Holding the glass over this cooler flame relieves internal pressures that cause cracking, in a process called annealing.Rotate the bend in the flame while counting out 150 seconds, or time yourself with a stopwatch.








, Place the glass on a heat-proof surface. If you are in a shared workspace, write the words ""Careful: HOT"" on a piece of paper next to it. Leave it to cool to room temperature before using. This can take several minutes.

Turn the glass jar or bottle over and let it dry for 12 hours.",How to Dye Glass2," This method of glass dyeing is faster and less expensive; however, it should not be used with glass that will get wet or serve food.

,, Adding your food coloring to glue is similar to adding food coloring to frosting. The Food Network has a guide for achieving vibrant shades, at http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes-and-cooking/frost-by-numbers-how-to-make-frosting-colors/index.html.


Remember that your shade will dry to a lighter tint than it first appears.

, (4.9 ml) of white glue or Mod Podge with 3 drops of food coloring and 1.5 tsp. (7.4 ml) of water. Use a disposable bowl and spoon to mix the dye.

, Your glass dye will go further if you paint the surface with a broad brush. However, you can also pour the glue mixture into a jar and swirl it around.


The swirl method may result in more dripping and drip marks.

, Allow it to rest for 6 hours, or until it stops dripping. Excess dye will accumulate at the mouth of a jar.


If you are dyeing a flat surface, simply lay it face up.

, Once the glass appears tinted, rather than painted, it is ready to use for decoration. "

Put on safety glasses.,
Light a candle.,
Make a simple bend by hand.,
Try more advanced designs.,
Control the thickness and length of the stringer.,
Fire the glass (optional).",How to Bend Glass2," Glass stringers are thin, specially prepared rods designed for use in craft projects. While they are easy to work with, their use still involves extreme temperatures and brittle glass. Always wear eye protection, and never touch the glass at the heated point.









You will also need a safe place to put the hot glass down, such as a brick. Tweezers are also useful for some of the steps below.

, Unlike thicker rods, stringers can be bent using an ordinary candle flame. A Bunsen burner or stationary torch will work as well, but these are not necessary.








, Hold both ends of the stringer with your hands. Lower the center into the candle flame and rotate it so it heats evenly. Once the glass is quite soft at that point, raise it up out of the candle flame, pause for a second, then bend the glass by moving one end of the stringer.









If wax gets on the glass, burn it off to prevent imperfections.The stringer will become black with soot, but this will burn off during firing. If you do not plan to fire your stringer in a kiln, wait for the glass to cool to room temperature, then rinse off the soot.

, To create curlicues, curved bends, or zig-zags, heat the end of the stringer. Use a pair of tweezers to push the hot end gently into position. Slowly move the stringer into the candle flame to heat the next section, pushing it with the tweezers as you go.








Stop well before your fingers reach the candle flame.

, Pull the stringer apart after the center has been heated to stretch it into a longer, thinner shape. Create a classy end point by snipping this thin piece apart with wire cutters or specialized glass cutters.








, Stringers are designed to be fired in a kiln, fusing to other fusible glass objects. If you are using a community kiln at an art studio, all you need to do is drop off the art and pay a fee. If you are handling the kiln yourself, and your stringers did not come with specific firing instructions, follow these steps instead:









Use glue or hairspray if necessary to arrange the stringers onto the fusible glass object. You can glue them to ""thin fire paper,"" which will burn off in the kiln. Place the object in the cold kiln.Heat the kiln rapidly until it reaches 675ºC (1250ºF). Top-fired kilns can be heated as much as +550ºC (+1000ºF) per hour, while side-fired kilns should not be heated faster than +330ºC (+600ºF) per hour.Heat more slowly and watch closely. Glass and kilns vary, so pay close attention as the kiln reaches 700ºC to 780ºC (1300ºF to 1450ºF).Start cooling the kiln, but leave it at 500ºC (950ºF) for 30 minutes to ""anneal"" the glass, relieving stress and preventing cracking."

Make artsy frosted glasses.,
Make a recycled fringe scarf.,
Make pretty decorative soaps.",How to Make Profitable Crafts1," Starting with tall, plain pillar candles, it's easy to end up with beautiful and desirable home decorating items that are likely to sell well. Choose unscented white candles for the most versatility, or make scent and color substitutions as you see fit depending on the items you intend to wrap the candles with.


Take a vanilla or unscented pillar candle and some twine or a thin leather thong. Prop sticks of cinnamon up against the candle and tie them to the candle with the twine or thong. The cinnamon will warm up and smell lovely when the candle is lit.
Take a rectangular strip of sackcloth and a scrap of patterned linen. Cut the scrap down so that it's about as tall as the strip is wide, and then cut a simple shape out of it with fabric scissors. (Fold it in half and cut out half a shape to get a symmetrical piece.) Use a bit of hot glue or another strong adhesive to glue the colorful shape to the sackcloth, and then tie the ensemble around a pillar candle with some twine.
Take a squat Mason jar with a wide mouth, such as a Ball wide mouth pint canning jar, and glue the bottom of a plain glass-cup candle inside it. Fill the space between the candle and the Mason jar with flattened glass gems (“dragon tears”) in combinations of one or two colors. The colors will light up beautifully when the candle is lit.;
, Buy cheap wine glasses or brandy snifters in good condition from thrift or discount stores. Wrap a few rubber bands around them, stuff the insides with newspaper, and then carefully and evenly apply a coat of frost-finish spray paint to the exterior. Once the paint dries, remove the paper and rubber bands to create a cool etched effect.


The glasses look neat, but they aren't dishwasher or microwave safe. Be sure to let your customers know.
Experiment with adding small shapes underneath the rubber bands, such as a leaf or cross. Consider using irregular natural shapes, too: a cup “etched” with a unique river stone's shape is an easy sell, and river stones are free.

, Start with any soft T-shirt. Use fabric scissors to carefully cut the shirt off just below the armpits. Take the tube-like bottom part of the shirt and lay it flat, then use your scissors to cut vertical fringe up from the bottom. Space your cuts an eighth to a quarter of an inch apart, and cut 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) up. Once the entire bottom of the shirt has been fringed, carefully twist and pull each fringe to stretch and loosen it. The resultant scarf is worn with the fringe pointed down.


This craft is easy to complete, but it will take a bit of practice to get good enough to sell it. Buy shirts from garage sales and dollar stores to practice on until you feel comfortable selling them.
Search secondhand shops for cool old designs and patterns to make one-of-a-kind scarves that'll sell like hotcakes.

, Although making high-quality, luxurious soap requires a fair amount of effort, simple decorative soaps can be made in less than half an hour and sold for use in guest rooms and gift baskets. Visit a craft store and purchase a block of glycerin soap, as well as a set of color dyes, a few scents (such as lemon, lavender, or mint), and some soft silicone or plastic molds. Cut a piece of soap from the block and melt it in the microwave, then use a Popsicle stick to stir in a few drops of coloring and scent. Pour the mixture into molds and let them set, then pop them out and trim them.


Go easy on the scents. A little goes a long way.
Use a spray bottle filled with rubbing alcohol to lightly spray your molds before you pour, and the bottoms of your soaps after you pour them into the molds. The alcohol will prevent unsightly bubbles from forming on them.
Use a craft knife to carefully trim any extra lip from the edges of the soaps after you remove them.

Have a plan – Even if you just scrawl it down on a piece of loose leaf paper, that will work – but you should definitely go into this with a plan.,
Search the markets – A lot of people have expressed an interest in your craft, but are they going to buy it at craft shows?,
Present well – If you have put together a plan, done your market research and you are ready to take this crafting business to the next level, then here is something you need to think about – presentation.,
The price is right – You bet it is!",How to Get Your Craft Show Business off the Ground," You will plan for things like: how many craft shows you will attend, the cost to make the craft and how much you should sell it for, craft show expenses (they vary from show to show), how many crafts you want to produce, and so on.
By going into this without a plan, you are essentially going in blindly, without a path to follow. This can be a precursor to failure – and that isn’t what we want. Set some goals, determine a few craft show costs and you are going to be much better off.;
, In order to find out, you need to go to a few craft shows before you start out on your own and decide if this product you have will sell. Are others selling it? If so, how is it selling?
Further, you can talk to craft store employees, other crafters, people at the craft shows – essentially anyone who might have an interest in your product and see if your craft is something they would buy. This is a slimmed-down version of market research – but it will be valuable to help you get your craft show business off the ground.

, If you just have a few tables with your crafts strewn about on the table – people will be less likely to buy.
However, if you create an attractive sales area, make your products easily accessible and provide a simple transaction for the customer – they are far more likely to buy!

, You will have to do a little bit of price discovery when you start, just to see the price when most of your crafts are going to sell. Some tips for finding the best prices are: go a penny lower than the next highest number; for example $9.99 instead of $10. Ask people what they would be willing to pay for it. The question may come as a surprise to them, but chances are they will give you an honest answer.

Similarly, you should protect yourself by wearing plastic or rubber gloves and a face mask. It's also a good idea to change into clothes that you won't mind staining in the event of accidental over-spray.;
, Locate a clear glass piece you wish to transform. Thoroughly wash the piece with water and soap, and dry completely with clean paper towels.


The piece you transform must be made of clear glass; plastics and colored glasses will not work. Other than these two restrictions, you can use this technique on nearly any piece, including vases, lamps, candle holders, jars, recycled bottles, serving trays, ornaments, and more.

,


For larger sections, you may wish to cover the area with newsprint or thick paper. Tape the paper in place with painter's tape.
When working with vases, jars, and other double-sided pieces, cover the side you do not plan on painting. You can apply the paint to either side of the glass, so the side you choose is mainly a matter of preference.

, Choose a mirror-finish spray paint. Rattle the can of paint for three to five minutes so that the paint evenly mixes.


Popular paints used for this project include Krylon® Looking Glass and Rust-Oleum® Mirror Effect. Any mirror-finish spray paint would probably work, but higher-quality paints such as these will create the best finish.

, Close the bottle and shake well for 60 seconds to combine the two components.


You can prepare more or less depending on the size of your glass piece, but either way, you need to maintain equal parts vinegar and water.
After combining the vinegar solution, set the nozzle of the spray bottle to a fine mist setting. Avoid using harsh stream settings.

, Continue until the entire surface is coated with small droplets of liquid.


Work carefully. To create the desired mottled-finish effect, you need to apply enough of the vinegar solution to cover the surface with small beads of moisture, but not enough to create running streaks.
For double-sided pieces, choose one side to work with. Paint manufacturers may recommend coating the inside of the piece, but coating the outside of the piece can be easier and will allow you to use the finished piece for more purposes.

,


These paints tend to be fairly thin, so you should hold the can roughly 1 foot (0.3 m) (30.5 cm) away from the surface and apply the paint in short bursts. Keep the coating light and even over the entire surface.

, Allow the paint to set over the vinegar solution for a full minute before continuing.


The paint will look cloudy when you first apply it, but after this first minute passes, it should begin setting to a bright mirror-like finish. You should also notice some mottling occurring beneath the paint thanks to the initial layer of vinegar solution.

, Lightly spray another thin coat of vinegar solution over the paint. As before, you should only apply enough vinegar to create light beads over the surface; do not use enough of the solution to create streaks.


While this step can enhance the mottling texture throughout the paint, it may not be needed. If you like the way the pain looks with only the underlying layer of vinegar, you can opt to skip this step and move directly to the next one.

, After another two minutes pass, crumple up a clean paper towel or soft rag and lightly blot away the beads of vinegar solution.


To make the mottling effect more controlled, consider dampening the paper towel with the vinegar solution before using it. This can be especially helpful if you did not apply a second coat of vinegar directly on top of the paint.
Use a straight up-and-down or small circular motion to remove the beads of liquid. Vary the pressure as needed or desired to distress the paint, but do not rub the surface from side to side.
Note the appearance of the glass after this step. If you applied the paint as thinly as necessary, the glass will still look slightly translucent at this point.

, Allow the paint to continue drying for another one or two minutes. Afterward, repeat the vinegar solution and paint layers as before, continuing until you achieve the desired look.


Shake the vinegar solution and can of spray paint in between each layer.
Give each layer a few minutes to dry before creating another one. Overall, you'll probably need about three layers, but you can safely use up to four during this process without negatively affecting the way the paint dries.
Depending on the dimensions of the piece, you may need to turn the piece upside-down for one or two of the coats to adequately cover all sides of it.

,


This step is technically another optional one, but it's also highly recommended. Applying a final layer of paint can fill in any spots that are still too translucent while adding another layer of dimension to the finished piece.

, Allow the piece to dry to the touch before handling it.


During this time, any dull cloudiness should completely fade and transform into a shiny, semi-reflective finish. The mottled effect created with the vinegar solution should remain in place, however.
If you painted a piece on multiple sides, consider leaving the glass on a drying rack so that air can circulate around the entire piece., Examine the appearance of the glass piece. If you are satisfied with the way it looks, continue directly into the next step; otherwise, touch up the paint before continuing.


Instead of applying additional layers of paint or vinegar solution, it's best to spot treat any areas you aren't satisfied with. Lightly mist these areas with paint or vinegar solution, drying and blotting as before to create the appropriate finish.

, Once you're satisfied with the final appearance of the mercury glass, set it aside and let the paint dry for a full 24 hours before using the piece.


As soon as the piece is dry to the touch, you can remove it from the protected working area and set it aside in a more convenient drying space.
Giving the paint a full 24 hours to dry is especially important if the glass will come into contact with water or other forms of moisture. If you allow the paint to get wet before it completely cures, it may start peeling or fading.

, Once the piece has completely cured, you can use it for its intended purpose.


Note that you should never place unwrapped food directly inside of a painted glass if you painted the interior of the glass. Similarly, flowers may wither sooner and candles may cause distortions in the paint when placed inside interior-painted glass.
If you wish to use the glass for the above mentioned purposes but painted the inside instead of the outside, simply insert a smaller, clear glass inside of the painted vessel before filling it."

Make a bird feeder wreath.,
Make a glass jug lamp.,
Knit accessories.,
Make specialty foods.",How to Make Profitable Crafts2," This craft requires a bundt pan and several ingredients, but the results are well worth it. You'll press a birdseed mixture into the bundt pan and let it set, then finish it with a festive ribbon for a pretty item that's ideal for birdwatching enthusiasts and family backyards.


Mix ¼ cup warm water with a packet of plain gelatin, such as Knox, until the gelatin dissolves. At that point, whisk in 3 tablespoons of corn syrup (like Karo) and ¾ cup of flour until you get a thick paste.
Stir in 4 cups of mixed birdseed and keep stirring until everything is worked in well together.
Spray a bundt pan with nonstick cooking spray, and then press the birdseed mixture in evenly around the ring. Let it set for 10 minutes, then shake it out onto a clean surface.

To make the wreath a little more symmetrical, you can replace it upside-down in the bundt pan and press it gently, which will smooth the back edges somewhat. Be careful not to damage the shape of the front of the wreath.


Let the wreath sit aside in a dry place for 36-48 hours. You can make more wreaths during this time if you want.
Once the wreaths are set, cut a long length of thick ribbon and tie it in a loose bow around the wreath to make a hanger.

, Start with a large glass bottle or jug. These can be found in junk and antique shops, as well as from thrift sellers and garage sales. Pick something big enough to make a decent table lamp. Next, buy a bottle lamp kit from a craft store; these vary in price from around $12 – 35. You should at least get a lightbulb assembly with a cork (to fit into the mouth of the bottle or jug) and an AC cord with a plug. Install the kit and finish with a cheap thrift-store lampshade.


Typically, to get the best-looking lamp, you'll have to drill into the glass to run the cord through. Doing this properly requires a power drill and some patience. Be careful to follow all safety instructions and work slowly to prevent shattering the glass.
You can spice these lamps up even further by decorating the interior of the jug before you fasten the lightbulb socket. Try adding pretty stones, or use thin glue and glitter to make the lamp sparkle from the inside. Using colored glass is also a great idea.

, If you can knit, you can earn. Well-made knit items like hats and scarves fly off shelves during the fall and winter months, especially if you make them with luxurious yarn. Find basic patterns and guides at any yarn store, or all over the Internet; practice until you can knit some classic items without any trouble. Be sure to use premium wool, and produce items in a wide range of colors for the best results.


Around the holidays, try knitting some cute ornaments and selling them for a few dollars each. You can use cheap, brightly colored yarn for these, and finish them with a loop of thread or a metal clamp fastener for easy hanging.

, If you've got a culinary inclination and a willingness to cook in big batches, you can make tasty food with a long shelf life and sell packages of it at public events. Bear in mind that to do this, you generally need to clear your cooking facility (your kitchen) with local health authorities first; laws may vary depending on where you live, but always do your research before you start selling food to people. Pay for any required licenses.


Homemade fudge is often a big hit. It's easy to dress up with different types of chocolate, nuts, and food coloring, and it keeps for quite a while. Wrap it in cling wrap by the quarter pound, put a jam jar sticker on it with your name and the name of the fudge, and watch it fly off the shelf at your next bazaar or craft fair.
If you're a meat eater, get in touch with your local meat market and buy a nice big piece of lean meat to turn into jerky. Cut the meat into ¼ inch strips and prepare a marinade on the stove top. Boil the marinade, and drop your meat strips in a few at a time for a minute or two to set the marinade. Remove them with tongs and place them across a clean wire rack in the oven at a very low heat (around 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for 3-4 hours. Turn the strips, then repeat for another 3-4 hours. Once you're done, use a home vacuum sealer to seal your jerky in packages that will keep for many months.

Depending on the meat and the marinade you use, your jerky can have many different possible flavors. Find a few you like and sell them. If you're not sure when you'll be able to get a particular cut of meat again, market it as a “limited time special.”
Get the leanest meat you can. Fat doesn't do well in storage.

Keep track of your expenditures.,
Shop around.,
Offer samples.,
Offer set discounts.,
Market aggressively.",How to Make Profitable Crafts3," When determining what to charge, it helps to know what you spent. In addition to material costs, be sure to account for the time you spent making your items, and the cost of setting up displays to sell them. This will help you come to a reasonable minimum price you can set to be sure you don't feel cheated when you sell.

, If you'd like to get a better idea of what to charge, investigate the competition. Try to get a sense for what the average selling price for similar items is. This will give you a range to work with, one that might very well increase your profit margin considerably.

, If you make anything that can be consumed, such as soap, bath salts, wine, or food, offer small samples to customers who pass by. If your wares can speak for themselves, customers are much more likely to come back and buy them later.

, No matter what you make, follow the rule of three to keep your customers happy: Each item costs a certain amount, but if you buy three items, you get a decent percentage off. Typically, the discount is between 20 and 30%, but you can decide for yourself based on the profit margin you've already set for yourself. You can also offer discounts for specific sets of items, such as “two jars of jam and a box of homemade cookies for $10 instead of $12.”


People love to buy in gift sets. Have gift packaging ready for all your items, and larger specialty packaging for groups of two to four items.

, These days, with the Internet everywhere, it's easier than ever to learn how to make your own crafts. Stand out from the pack by establishing a presence in the market and making yourself known.


Make social media accounts for your business, and give it a memorable name. Post regular updates related to the items you sell.
Speak with local business owners about carrying your products on commission, or helping stage a community event to generate business for all of you. Be proactive and establish yourself as a businessperson to get the support of the business community.
Provide relevant supplies to community causes. If a local children's organization is planning to make gift baskets, offer to supply some basic homemade soaps; make a weekly donation of home-canned (and properly licensed!) soup or jerky to a soup kitchen or regular church meal. The more you attach your name to positive actions, the more highly people will regard you and your crafts.

Start planning.,
Work out how marketable your products are.,
Decide where you will make your items.,
Plan your budget.,
Decide where you'd like to run your small arts and craft business.,
Consider whether you'll sell alone or with others.,
Consider what tie-ins you'll produce.",How to Create a Small Arts and Craft Business," Decide what you're going to make or do. This must be chosen on what you're really good at doing and know that you can continue to reproduce reliably and with a high standard of quality. If this means that you need to take classes, then you'll need to include this in your planning. Things that you might consider making or doing include:


Paintings, drawings, sketches, etc.
Sewn, stitched, embroidered items such as clothing, toys, miniatures, knitting/crochet, blankets/afghans/throws, quilts, slippers, cushions/pillows, miscellaneous household items, bags, etc.
Pottery, ceramic, glassware (including blown glass) and molded items.
Leather or pleather items such as bags, wallets, belts, shoes, etc.
Paper craft items such as cards, stationery sets, covered boxes, pen holders, origami, etc.
Lighting items such as lampshades, light shades, specialist lights, candles, lanterns, etc.
Jewelry, beaded items, hair accessories, body art, etc.
Grooming/beauty/hygiene items such as soaps, body lotions, face/body cleansers, loofahs, heat pads, bath bombs, gel, etc.
Items specific to a particular need, such as pet gear, cake decorating supplies, hair accessories, wall decals, and the like.
Baked/cooked items such as candies, chocolates, bread, etc., all with that ""artisan"" touch or made the ""old-fashioned"" way.
Books (hard cover or ebooks) about your skill.
Teaching your skills in any particular art or craft. You could set up class times for teaching others how to make the amazing things you sell.;
, If you're already making items, you'll need to assess how sales worthy they actually are. It is one thing to make items suitable for end-of-year gifts for friends and family, who will be polite and love what you do regardless of quality and utility; it is quite another thing to produce items people will actually pay for. You'll need to assess how marketable your art and/or craft items are by checking some of the following things:


Is there a current demand for your objects, products, creations or services? How do you know this? Do an online search of such sites as Pinterest, Etsy and eBay to see what is attracting attention and potentially selling well currently.
Do a visit to local craft selling stores and art galleries to see what is selling at the moment.
How durable, useful, beautiful, unusual, etc., are your creations? Consider who else is competing in your area and whether you're either offering something of greater value or more interest, or whether you're diversifying the field sufficiently for you to capture new areas of the market without being out competed by someone else.

, If you don't already have a workshop or space, you'll need one now and it'll have to include some form of storage for your creations. If you don't have storage space, you'll need to consider having some off-site, somewhere secure, dry and easily accessible (and, of course, affordable).

Your workshop needs to be kept distinct from your daily household happenings, so that you treat it as a serious business endeavor.
Try to work in a place of no to low cost to begin with; you can decide later whether or not it is financially viable to move into a place that costs money to rent.
Some places that might be suitable for a workshop space include: A spare room, a treehouse, a cabin, a shed or a mobile home in the yard. Customize the space to how you need it to be.

, Everything must come within a budget that is manageable and possible. What start-up funds do you have? Are you borrowing money from family, friends or the bank? Do you already have funds set aside in your own savings? You need to know what solid financial base you're beginning from and then you'll need to know how to reconcile that with your ongoing expenses and paying back borrowed amounts. If you cannot work this part out yourself, get hold of someone who has a great head for numbers and is willing to help you for free at the start (perhaps give them some free creations as payment).


Consider getting an accountant early on, to assist you with the financial aspects and to stay on top of things.

, This could be done from home, with a small room, workshop or stall dedicated to a retail business. You would need to comply with local laws regarding sales in a residential area and some places won't allow this, while in others, it might be the norm (such as a country town or a farm). If you wanted a standalone shop, you'd need to find one that is affordable. Some other options include:


For a beginner, it is often best to find a store that acts as a consignment or cooperative sales place for many artists selling their wares; this keeps down the costs for you and broadens the shopper base as shoppers are attracted by the wide variety of goods on offer.
You could sell your items online rather than in a physical space, using sites such as Etsy or eBay, or opening your own standalone shop site.
You could sell items at a regular market stall or at specialist art and craft markets/fairs that aren't as regular but are a big deal when they are held. You'd need to include transport and stall table/banners/covers/shelter requirements as part of your market planning.

, If you can manage creating and selling in the time you have available, then you can do it alone, at least at the outset. However, if you find that the sales eat into your creating time or that you have such a large volume of sales that you can't do this alone, then you'll need helpers. Options include:


Hire some friends to help you. This step is optional. If you do want to have some people working, ask them and if they want to be paid pay them a bit of the profit made.

, For example, you may wish to run an email list for interested buyers and regularly update them with new products, stories about your craft journey and perhaps link to a regularly updated blog related to your art and craft business. Remember that this will add time to your work but it is often an excellent, non-intrusive and useful form of marketing that readers love, especially when given the choice of reading your blog in their own time and way. Always be ready to answer comments or questions whenever you use interactive media to promote your sales."

The clear cap needs to be larger than the base as the dichroic layer can sometimes seep out under the clear glass.Be careful when stacking the glasses. Dichroic glass surfaces should not face each other because they do not bond well.
Layer your glass as a gold dichroic (black base), stringers (transparent), ripple (transparent), and cover glass (clear cap).;
, If you’re using a manual kiln, set the temperature to medium for about 15 minutes. Bring up to 1500°F (815°C) per hour and hold for 10 minutes. If using a programmable kiln, ramp your temperature up to 1500°F per hour and hold for 10 minutes. Check that your cabochons have fully fused. If not, let the temperature return to 1500°F and hold for another 5 minutes.Once the glass has fully fused, turn the kiln off and open the door until the temperature reaches 1000°F (540°C). Close the door. Repeat until the temperature is stable at 1000°F.

, Turn the kiln back on and hold at this temperature for 20 to 30 minutes. This is the annealing temperature, which helps reduce the stresses and strains that build up in the glass during fusing.


After annealing the glass, turn the kiln off and wait until the glass is fully cooled before removing.
For programmable kilns, you will be able to include these steps in your firing schedule.

, After the fused glass has cooled, you can use a tile saw, a glass saw, or a ring saw to trim those edges. Use the saw to then cut the fused glass into a variety of different shapes, sizes, and pieces., Rinse the cabochon in water. Place it back into the kiln and fire it at full ramp to a target of 1350 degrees, holding it for 10-15 minutes. Afterwards, allow the cabochons to cool completely between several hours to a full day.

, You can position them straight across, at various angles, or a combination of the two. Don't be afraid to overlap some of the rubber bands either!For a more interesting design, choose a variety of rubber bands, both thick and thin.

, The best place to work would be outdoors. If you can't work outdoors, make sure that you have plenty of windows open. Cover your work surface with newspaper, and make sure that there's nothing nearby that can get ruined., Shake the can until you can hear it rattle, then hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the vase. Apply the sealer in quick, even strokes. It will take about 10 to 20 minutes for the paint to dry.


For the typical, frosted look, choose a paint that says ""frosted glass"" on it.
For a more interesting look, you can use a colored spray paint, such as gold or silver. You can even experiment with glittered spray paint.

, Allow each coat to dry for 10 minutes before applying the next one. If you are working with ""frosted glass"" spray paint, don't worry if it looks clear at first; it will look frosted once it dries., If a little paint got under the rubber bands, use your fingernail to scratch it off. If there is a lot of dust on the vase, wipe it down with a damp cloth., You can use it to hold flowers or candles. You can even make it fancier by wrapping a pretty ribbon around the center.

Mold the jagged pieces into puddles.,
Remove flaws from your puddle cabochon pieces.,
Return sandblasted or etched cabochon puddles to the kiln.,
Remove the finished cabochon puddles.",How to Make Fused Glass Cabochons2," Place a stack of seven 1/8” thick layers of 3x3” glass in your kiln. If you are fusing together two stacks of glass in your kiln at a time, make sure that you leave enough empty space around them in the kiln so that the glass pieces can spread easily as they melt to fuse together., The firing schedule will be broken up into four different segments where you will adjust and hold the temperature for a specified amount of time to heat the layers. Avoid thermal shock by slowing the ramp of the first segment for firing layers bigger than 3x3” in size.For the first segment, fire the layers at a ramp of 500 degrees per hour with a target of 1225 degrees Fahrenheit. Hold that temperature for an hour.
For the second segment, fire the layers on a full ramp with a target of 1500 degrees and hold that temperature for 30 minutes.
For the third segment, fire the layers again on a full ramp with a new target temperature of 950 degrees Fahrenheit for an hour.
For the fourth and last segment, fire the layers on a ramp of 150 degrees Fahrenheit per hour with a target of 725 degrees. This is a quick firing so don’t bother holding it for any allotted amount of time. Meet the target temperature and turn the kiln off.

, At this point, the layers of glass should have spread to be about 1/3 of the original height of the stack of glass.Transport the puddles to your work table once they are fully cooled.

, Clean the fused glass and turn them over. You should be able to see concentric ring of colors as a result of the seven layers fusing together.Use firm pressure and score the puddle in the middle by scoring it down the middle with a glass cutter.

, If the glass is too thick to break away, which a lot of the time it is, there is an alternative method to breaking the glass. Set the glass on top of two pencils at both sides of the puddle’s long edges. Use the edge of a hammer’s face to give the glass a firm tap.The score line you created with a glass cutter in the previous step should be on the puddle’s other side when you break the class. So break the glass with the score line face down.
Always use eye protection when you’re hitting glass with the hammer, even when doing a light or firm tap.

, Each half of the puddle needs to be broken down further to create smaller pieces that will be easier to work with and refine. A recommended tool to use is a mosaic nipper. Cut the sheets into a variety of smaller pieces., Heat is necessary to create cabochons into the round, non faceted stones, or puddles, that this method calls for. Firing it in the kiln again is necessary. Arrange the chunks onto the kiln, a few inches apart, as you would cookie dough on a baking sheet.For the first segment, fire the puddles at a ramp of 500 degrees Fahrenheit an hour with a target of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not hold it for any amount of time, just do a rapid fire and heat it quickly until it reaches its target temp.
For the second segment, fire the puddles at a full ramp with a target of 1500 degrees Fahrenheit. Hold it for 30 minutes.
For the third segment, fire the puddles at full ramp again with a new target of 950 degrees Fahrenheit. Hold it for 30 minutes.
For the fourth segment, fire the puddles at 300 degrees an hour with a target of 725 degrees Fahrenheit. Don’t hold it. Instead just fire it rapidly again.

, Shelf primer might be stuck on the bottoms of puddle cabochons and vinegar is a great way to remove this. Soak the pieces for 20-30 minutes, shake them in their container gently, and remove the puddle cabochons from the vinegar.Shelf primer should easily rinse away after a soak. If it doesn’t, soak them again for a longer time until you notice the shelf primer is completely gone.
Remove any devitrification with a sandblaster. If you don’t have any access to a sandblaster, light devitrification can removed from the tops of cabochon puddles with glass etching cream. Coat the puddles with cream for 30 minutes and then rinse them clean.

, A final fire polish is the last step to finishing your puddles. Because it’s providing a polish to the puddles, holding times during most segments are obsolete.For the first firing segment, have a ramp of 500 degrees Fahrenheit an hour with a target of 1000 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not hold once it’s met its target.
For the second firing segment, have a full ramp with a target of 1400 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not hold it.
For the third firing segment, have a full ramp with a target of 950 degrees Fahrenheit. Hold it for 30 minutes.
For the fourth firing segment, have a ramp of 300 degrees Fahrenheit an hour with a target of 725 degrees Fahrenheit. Do not hold it.

, When the firing is complete and the kiln has cooled, remove the cabochon puddles from the kiln. Your jewelry components are done and ready to be used. Be mindful that it can take several hours to a full day for the cooling to be complete.

Apply even pressure as you make a firm, clean cut.,
Assemble pieces together to prepare them for the kiln.,
Place the glass pieces into the kiln.",How to Make Fused Glass Cabochons3," Hold your glass cutter like a pen and cut a straight line onto your glass. Cut towards you if you are making straight lines. Cut away from you if you are cutting curved lines.Snap straight cuts by using breaking pliers. Alternatively, you can hold the piece of glass at either side of the cut you’ve made and snap the glass apart that way too.
Tap curved cuts at the back of the glass along the score line until it begins to break.

, Create designs with 2-3 layers of 1.6 mm thick glass, either all different colors or in a pattern. Place them onto the kiln about 10 mm apart so that they can spread without interfering with the other fusing glasses on the kiln.Add small amounts of the PVA/water mix (half PVA glue, half water) to the glass to help them stick together and to prevent displacement when you move them around.
Make sure that the glue is dried completely before you turn on the kiln to begin firing the pieces.
Consider the location of the glass pieces you place on the kiln. For example, if you want squarer cabochons, position the glass closer to the front where the kiln is cooler.

, Fire up the kiln and begin firing the pieces at different ramps and temperatures to make the glass pieces fuse together and create the bullseye cabochons. If you have an automatic kiln, enter the numbers below and the kiln will do the work. Otherwise, adjust the segments manually.For the first segment, have the ramp at 222C at the target temperature of 677C, and hold it for 30 minutes.
For the second segment, have the ramp at 333C at the target temperature of 816C, and hold it for 10 minutes.
For the third segment, have the ramp at full at the target temperature of 516C, and hold it for 30 minutes.
For the fourth segment, have the ramp at 83C at the target temperature of 371C, and do not hold it. This is a rapid fire.
For the fifth segment, have the ramp at full at the target temperature of 80C, and again do not hold it. This is another rapid fire. Allow the fused pieces to cool afterwards. Be aware that it can take hours for it to cool completely.

Fill a disposable container with warm water.,
Add 1 to 2 drops of nail polish into the water.,
Let the nail polish spread out.,
Dip the bottom of the tumbler into the water using a circular motion.,
Use nail polish remover to wipe away any excess nail polish.,
Pat the tumbler dry with a paper towel.,
Let the tumbler dry overnight.Set the tumbler upside down on a sheet of paper, a wire cooling rack, or a baking sheet.,
Consider adding a glossy, clear, acrylic sealer over the design using a sponge brush.,
Use the tumbler with care.",How to Make Dip Dyed Tumblers1," You will be dipping your tumbler into the container. How far you dip depends on how far up the tumbler you want the design to go. The water and container need to be deep enough to accommodate that. Also, try to get the water as warm as you can. If the water is too cold, the nail polish will start to set as soon as you add it in. The hotter the water is, the slower the nail polish will set, giving you more time to work with., Keep the bottle of nail polish as close to the water as you can. If you drop the nail polish into the water from too high up, the nail polish will sink to the bottom instead of float on top.Only use one color for this. You can always add more colors later on.


Avoid using gel or the quick-drying kind of nail polish., You can also swirl the drops together using a toothpick or wooden skewer., How far you dip is entirely up to you, but you should leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of space from the rim bare. Also, don't worry if you dip too far or mess up.


This method works best on ceramic tumblers. It may work on ones made out of glass or plastic.

, Dip a cotton ball in nail polish remover it, then use it to wipe away any excess nail polish from the rim and the inside of the tumbler.If you are using a plastic tumbler, avoid using a nail polish remover with acetone in it, as acetone can fog or discolor certain types of plastic, such as acrylic.

, At this point, you can set your tumbler aside to dry, or you can repeat the method with more colors of nail polish., This will give the nail polish time to set, and prevent the bottom from getting stuck to anything.

, If you are using a glass type tumbler, getting the sealer within 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of the rim. If this is the travel-mug kind of tumbler, you can coat the entire tumbler with sealer.You can apply more than one coat of sealer, but be sure to let each coat dry first before you apply a new one.You can also use clear nail polish or an acrylic spray sealer., Even though nail polish sticks better to glass and ceramic better than regular types of paint, it is still fragile. Wash the tumbler by hand using cool water and a soft cloth. Never let the tumbler sit in water, and don't wash it in the washing machine."

Choose a plain, glass vase without any grooves or raised designs.,
Rinse the vase using soap and warm water, and pat it dry.,
Wrap some rubber bands around the vase.,
Take the vase into a well-ventilated area, and put on a pair of rubber gloves.,
Apply the etching cream generously to the vase.,
Wait 10 to 20 minutes, then rinse the etching cream off and gently pat the vase dry.,
Carefully remove the rubber bands.,
Display the vase.",How to Make a Frosted Vase with a Rubber Band2," The best vase to use is one that has straight sides, but you can also use a mason jar instead.

, If there is any oily residue on the vase, wipe it off using rubbing alcohol.

, You can position them straight across, at different angles, or a combination of the two. You can even try overlapping some of the rubber bands. For a more interesting design, get both thick and thin rubber bands.

, A pair of safety goggles would also be highly recommended at this point. The rubber gloves are absolutely necessary, however; etching cream is caustic and can burn your skin.

, You can do this using a cheap paintbrush or a foam brush. Apply it in a thick, gloopy layer, and be careful not to ""scrape"" across the rubber bands. If you do, you might get some etching cream under them and disrupt the banded design.

, If you find the cream difficult to remove, you can gently scrub it off using an old toothbrush. Use an old rag or towel to dry the vase and remove any residual cream.Do not rinse the cream off in an enamel sink. Use a metal sink or a plastic bucket., Be careful not to snap the rubber bands, as some of the etching cream may have seeped under them. The etching will be faint and subtle at first, but it will become more opaque as the glass dries.If you are still not happy with the results, reapply the rubber bands and etching cream, wait another 10 to 20 minutes, and rinse it off again., You can add flowers to it, or use it as a candle votive. For an added touch, you could wrap a pretty ribbon around the middle.

",How to Do Glass Painting from a Pattern Tracing," Glass painting requires a little more than just paint and brushes. You will also need to prepare your glass piece properly, so that the paint will stick. Some paints also need to be cured in an oven. Here is a list of what you will need to get a basic painting done:


Glass object to paint
Cotton balls
Rubbing alcohol
Design printed on paper
Masking tape
Glass paints
Paint brushes
Plate or palette
Oven (optional);
, You can paint things like jars, cups, or wine glasses. You can also paint a glass panel. The best place to get a glass panel is from a picture frame. When you are done painting, you can display the finished piece inside the frame. Make sure that the panel in the frame is glass, however; some frames come with an acrylic panel instead of glass.


You can take the back out of a picture frame, or leave it in. If you decide to leave the back in, you might want to cover it with some white paper. Most glass paint is translucent, so it will show up best against a white background.

, Even if the glass looks clean, you will still want to wash it. Any oil, dirt, or dust may keep the paint from sticking to the surface.

, It needs to be printed on paper. If you are painting something like a cup or jar, the paper needs to be trimmed down so that it can fit inside.


The best patterns to use are just outlines, like from a coloring book.

, If you plan on using this glass piece for eating or drinking out of, move the pattern to a place where food, drink, or mouths won't be touching it. Even if a glass paint is labeled as ""non-toxic,"" it may not be food-safe.If you are painting on a flat sheet of glass, place the pattern face down on the glass. Tape the edges down with masking tape, and flip the glass over.
If you are painting on a cup, place the pattern inside the cup. Move it around until it is where you want it to be. Press the paper against the wall of the cup, and tape it in place.
Keep borders in mind. If you are going to put the glass panel inside a frame, make sure that the frame won't be covering your design., Soak a cotton ball with some rubbing alcohol, and wipe down the entire surface of your glass piece. Any oily residue left on the glass from when you handled it may keep the paint from sticking.Try not to touch the area where the pattern is from now on.

, You are doing this, because the first bit of paint often tends to gush out in a glob. It is better for this to happen on a sheet of paper than on your painting.


Some glass paint liners are labeled as ""leading"" or as ""dimensional.""
Most glass liners come in black, but you might also find them in other colors as well, such as silver and gold.

, Hold the tip just above the glass, and start tracing the design. Use long, continuous strokes. If you make short strokes, your lines are more likely to end up uneven and goopy. Also, try not to drag the tip on the glass. This will cause the paint to come out too thin and streaky.


If you are left-handed, try to start tracing from the right side first. If you are right-handed, start tracing from the left. This will help prevent you from accidentally smudging the wet outline while you work.

, Once you have finished outlining your piece, look over it carefully. If you see any lumps or clumps, you can wipe them away with a Q-tip dipped in rubbing alcohol. If the paint has dried, you can scratch it away with a craft knife., Most glass paint liners will take about six to eight hours to dry.You might want to refer to the label on the bottle for a more specific drying time, however, as each brand will be a little different.


If you are pressed for time, you can hold a fan or hairdryer over the paint. This will help it dry faster. If you are using a hair dryer, make sure that you are using the lowest setting., If your glass paint comes with a pointy tip, you can apply the paint to the glass directly from the bottle. You can also squirt the paint onto a pallet and apply it with a paintbrush; this will give you the most control.


You can use both synthetic and natural brushes for glass painting. Synthetic brushes may cost less, but they will be more likely to leave behind brush strokes. Brushes made from soft, natural fibers, may be more expensive, but they will leave behind the smoothest finish., Do not press down too hard with the brush, or you will wipe the existing paint off. Instead, let the brush glide across the surface that needs to be painted. If the paint is too thin in one area, wait until it dries before applying a second coat. If you try to go over wet paint a second time, you may end up wiping it off.Glass paint will shrink a little when it dries. Try to paint all the way to the outline. If you are having troubles reaching a tight area, such as a point or corner, use a toothpick to spread the paint.The thicker you lay the paint on, the more it will level off. This reduces brush strokes.To create a swirled, marbled effect, put a few drops of two or more colors into the space you want colored. Use a toothpick to lightly swirl the colors together. Do not over-mix, or you may lose the swirled effect and end up with a solid color., When you are ready to move on to a new color, dip the brush in water and swirl it about to remove any excess paint. Lightly dab the brush against a paper towel. If you see any color on the towel, rinse the brush again. If you don't see any color, keep tapping the brush until there's no water left on the bristles. If water gets into the paints, it can cause beading., Look over your piece carefully, and see if there are any places that need touching up. It is much easier to touch things up while the paint is still wet than when it is dry. Use Q-tips, paintbrushes, and toothpicks dipped in rubbing alcohol to wipe away any excess paint. This is especially useful if you went outside the lines.Use a pin or needle to pierce any bubbles that may have formed in the paint. Be sure to do this while the paint is still wet.

, Some brands of paint need to dry for several days before they can be used, while others need to dry for up to a month. Some brands might require you to bake your piece in the oven. Always refer to the label on your bottle of paint.Some labels will tell you to ""cure"" your paint for a certain amount of time. This simply means to let the paint ""dry.""

, Depending on the brand of paint you used, however, the paint may not be cured all the way. If the paint feels sticky or gummy, it is not cured and needs to dry longer.


Most glass paints will be completely cured after 21 days.

, This will allow you to wash your piece in the dishwasher. Place your painted piece onto a foil-covered baking sheet, then put the baking sheet into a cold oven. Set the oven to 350°F (175°C), or whatever temperature the manufacturer recommends. Bake the item for about 30 minutes, then turn the oven off. Do not take the piece out of the oven yet. Instead, let the piece and the oven both cool down first. Removing the glass too soon may cause it to crack.


Most paint with glitter in it cannot be cured in the oven. You must allow them to air-cure for 21 days. The label on the bottle will tell you whether or not the paint can be oven-cured.If you are using glass paints from different brands, know that they may have different curing temperatures and times. To avoid burning the paint, stick with the lower baking temperature and time., Most glass paints are delicate after they cure, and should only be hand-washed using a soft cloth of sponge. If you cured your piece in the oven, you might be able to wash it in the top rack of a dishwasher. Never leave painted glass sitting in water, even if you oven-cured it. The water will cause the paint to flake away. Also, never use a scratchy sponge on a glass piece; you will scrape the paint off.

Clean your glass tumbler with rubbing alcohol.,
Wrap tape around the middle of your glass tumbler.,
Run your fingernail over the tape to seal it and remove any air bubbles.,
Apply the glass paint to the area below the tape.,
Wait 2 hours for the paint to dry, then apply another coat.Don't remove the tape, and use the same tapping motion as before.,
Let the paint dry for another 2 hours, then carefully peel the painters tape away.Once again, make sure that you place the tumbler upside down when you set it out to dry, or the tumbler may get stuck to your work surface.

,
Cure the glass paint.,
Use the tumbler with care.",How to Make Dip Dyed Tumblers2," Soak a paper towel or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the surface of your glass tumbler with it. Set the tumbler aside, and let them dry. This should only take a few seconds.

, You can position the tape a quarter of the way up, half way up, or even three-quarters of the way. You can have the tape perfectly straight, or at an angle. The area below the tape is the area that you will paint. The area above the paint will be left clear., You can also use a credit card or gift card instead.If you are into scrapbooking, you could even use a bone folder.

, Pour out some glass paint onto a paper plate or palette. Dip a foam pouncer into the paint, then tap the paint onto the tumbler. Hold the tumbler by the top or by the inside. Try not to touch the area you will be painting; any oils from your skin may prevent the paint from sticking.Don't worry if the paint doesn't go on evenly. You'll be adding a second coat shortly, which will resolve this.

, The paint should be more even now. If it isn't, repeat this step one more time.


Set the tumbler upside down while it dries so that it doesn't get stuck.

,, Each brand will be a little different, so read the instructions on the paint jar or on the company's website. In general, however, you'd want to let the paint cure for several days, then bake the tumbler in the oven. Some brands may be cured without an oven, but require at around 21 days' curing., Glass paint is pretty durable once it is cured. Some brands can even be top-rack dishwasher safe, depending on how they are cured. Nonetheless, don't let the tumbler soak or stand in water. It is always best to wash it by hand with a soft cloth or sponge.

Get a tumbler.,
Wrap a strip of painter's tape around the tumbler.,
Smooth out any wrinkles in the tape.,
Wipe down the tumbler using rubbing alcohol.,
Apply thick coat of decoupage glue.,
Use your brush to wipe off any excess decoupage.,
Shake on some fine glitter.,
Let the tumbler dry for 1 to 2 hours.,
Apply another coat of decoupage and another coat of glitter.,
Wait for the decoupage to dry, then apply two more coats of decoupage, allowing each coat to dry.,
Carefully peel the tape away.,
Seal the top edge in, and let it dry.,
Allow the tumbler to dry completely before using it.",How to Make Dip Dyed Tumblers3," This method works best for those plastic traveling mugs that you use for coffee, but it might work on glass or ceramic tumblers too. Keep in mind that decoupage glue does not stick very well to glass or ceramic, so your design may not last as long.

, You can wrap the tape as high or as low as you'd like. The area below the tape will get the glitter, while the area above the tape will be left blank.


Cut slits into the top edge of the tape before pressing it down. This will allow it to conform to the tumbler better., Don't worry so much about the top edge of the tape. Make sure that the bottom edge is as smooth as possible, however, or your design won't end up crisp and neat.


If there are any gaps caused by the slits you made, fill them in with more painter's tape.

, Soak a paper towel or cotton ball with rubbing alcohol, then wipe down the tumbler.If your tumbler is very smooth, consider buffing it with fine-grit sandpaper first. This will give the decoupage glue something to stick to.

, Using a paintbrush, apply a generous amount of decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) to the tumbler below the tape. It's okay if you got some decoupage onto the tape. When you pull the tape away at the very end, you will pull away the excess decoupage and reveal a nice, crisp line., Start by brushing downward across the decoupage, from the painter's tape down to the edge of the tumbler. Wipe the brush off on the rim of the decoupage bottle, then move onto the next section. Keep doing this until an even layer of glue remains and you can't see any streaks., Hold your tumbler over a paper plate or a sheet of paper. Choose some fine, scrapbooking glitter in a color that you like. Shake the glitter over the tumbler, rotating the tumbler while doing so.Don't worry if the glitter doesn't come out even. You'll be adding a second coat shortly.

, Carefully set the tumbler upside down on a sheet of paper, with the glittered portion facing up. Wait 1 to 2 hours for it to dry. In the meantime, you can use your paper plate to transfer the glitter back into its container., Once again, brush on a thick coat of decoupage. This time, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler. Wipe the excess decoupage off, just like before, and shake some more glitter onto it., Allow the glitter to dry first, about 1 to 2 hours. Next, apply a thick coat of decoupage, wipe away any excess, and let it dry for 1 to 2 hours. Apply a second and final coat of decoupage, wipe off any excess, and let it dry.When applying these last two coats of decoupage, be sure to extend it just past the glitter and onto the bottom edge of the tumbler. This helps to seal the glitter in.

, Lift the tape straight up rather than downwards so that you don't accidentally peel off the glitter. Discard the tape when you are done.

, Using small, downward strokes, apply some decoupage to the top edge of the glitter part of your tumbler. When you are done, there should be a thin line of decoupage between the glittered and plain parts of the tumbler. This helps to seal in the glitter further.At this point, your tumbler is done. You can make it fancier by adding vinyl letters or designs, or sketching on patterns using a permanent marker.

, Each brand of decoupage glue will be a little different, so be sure to refer to the packaging. Once the glue is dry, your tumbler is ready to use. You should only wash the inside and upper rim. If the glittered part gets dirty, wipe it down with a damp cloth, then dry it immediately. Do not let the tumbler sit in water or wash it in the dishwasher, or the glitter will peel away.

Find a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid.,
Decide what you want to put inside.,
Create the scene on the underside of the jar lid.,
Fill the jar with water, glycerin and glitter.,
Carefully put the lid on.,
Decorate the lid (optional).",How to Make a Snow Globe1," Any size will do, as long as you have figurines that will fit inside them.


Pimiento jars, olive jars, artichoke heart jars and baby food jars are all good choices, but anything with a tight-fitting lid will do the trick - just take a look in your fridge.
Wash the jars inside and out. If you're having trouble removing the label, try rubbing it with hot soapy water and using a plastic card or knife to scrape it off. Dry thoroughly.;
, You can put anything you like inside your snow globe. Small children's toys are a good option, as are winter-themed figurines or cake-toppers (think snowmen, Santa Clauses and Christmas trees) from thrift and craft stores.


Just make sure the figurines are plastic or ceramic, as other materials (like metal) may start to rust or turn funny after being submerged in water.
If you want to get a little more creative, try making your own figurines from clay. You can buy clay from a craft store, shape it into any form you want (snowmen are really easy) and bake them in the oven. Paint them with water-proof paint and they're ready to use.
Another idea is to take pictures of yourself, your family or your pets and laminate them. You can then cut around the outline of each person and place their photo in the snow globe, for a really personalized touch!
Even though it's called a snow globe you don't need to limit yourself to creating a winter scene. You could create a beach scene using sea shells and sand, or something playful and fun like a dinosaur or a ballerina.

, Take the lid of your jar and cover the underside with a layer of hot glue, superglue or epoxy. If you like, you can sand the lid with some sandpaper first - this will create a rougher surface which helps the glue to stick better.


While the glue is still wet, build your scene on the underside of the jar. Stick in your figurines, your laminated photos, your clay sculptures, or anything else you want to put in there.
If the item you're sticking has a narrow base (such as the laminated photos, or a snipping from a garland or plastic Christmas tree) it might be helpful to stick a few colored pebbles to the underside of the lid. Then you can just wedge the item between the pebbles.
Keep in mind that the scene you create will need to fit inside the jar opening, so don't make it too wide. Keep your figurines in the center of the lid.
Once you have created your scene, set the jar lid aside for a while to dry. The glue needs to be completely set before you can submerge it in water.

, Fill your jar almost to the brim with water and add 2 to 3 teaspoons of glycerin (which can be found in the baking section at the supermarket). The glycerin ""thickens"" the water, allowing the glitter to fall more slowly. You can achieve a similar effect with baby oil.


Next, add the glitter. How much will depend on the size of the jar and personal preference. You want to add enough to make up for the fact that some will get stuck to the bottom of the jar, but not so much that it obscures the scene you've created.
Silver and gold glitter are good options for winter or Christmas scenes, but really you can choose any color you like. You can also buy special snow globe ""snow"" online and in craft stores.
If you have no glitter on hand, you can make pretty convincing snow from crushed up eggshell. Just use a rolling pin to crush up the shell nice and fine.

, Take the lid and carefully screw it onto the jar. Close it as tightly as you can, and wipe up any displaced water with some paper towel.


If you're worried about the lid coming loose, you can place a ring of glue around the rim of the jar before you close it. Alternatively, you can wrap some colored tape around the lid.
However, sometimes you will need to reopen the jar to fix something that's come loose or to add fresh water or more glitter, so think about that before you seal it up.

, If you want, you can finish off your snow globe by decorating the lid.


You can paint it a bright color, wrap a decorative ribbon around it, cover it in felt, or stick festive berries, holly or jingle bells to it.
Once that's done, all that's left is to give your snow globe a good shake and watch the glitter fall gently around the beautiful scene you've created!

Finished.

",How to Design a Swirl Painted Vase," A simple wash using mild dish soap and warm water, followed by time to air dry and/or being rubbed with a clean cloth will do the trick.


Inspect the vase for chips or defects, especially if you are re-purposing an old vase.





;
, Depending upon the vase size and the amount of coverage you desire, pour a small amount to coat the bottom but not fill the vase.

, Use your hands and wrist to twist or spin the vase so as to distribute the paint along the sides of the vase.

,, If you plan to use only one color, your project is complete once the paint is totally dry.


Dry upside down on a piece of paper or paper towel. Excess paint will drip onto the paper. Leave for at least 12 hours, or more if needed.

, It may take up to 24 hours to ensure the paint is ready, but don’t add the next color until you are sure it won’t mingle with the previous color.,


Keep an eye on the exterior of the vase so ensure you can see the new color and it is distributed in the correct areas.







, This step is optional but can complete your look. Add small dots, stars or other symbols or words to personalize the vase.


If touch-ups are needed, do these now.

Wash the glass well in warm, soapy water.,
Clean the surface of the wine or martini glass with rubbing alcohol and a paper towel.,
Place masking tape on the rim of your glass.",How to Paint Wine Glasses1," Whether you're using a new glass or one of your old favorites, it can accrue a layer of dust or dirt just sitting in storage. Make sure it's sparkly clean -- run it under soapy water and rinse it well.


Allow it to adequately dry. You don't want to paint on glass that's streaky or wet.;
, Remove any oil, dirt, soap film, or fingerprints that will mess up your paint work. Let the glass sit to dry for about 7-10 minutes after rubbing.


If you don't have rubbing alcohol, use white vinegar; it has similar cleaning properties.

, You want a solid 3/4"" (2 cm) of your rim to be paint free. As some paint is toxic, it's important not to paint on any surface that could reach your mouth. What's more, the paint will be more likely to deteriorate if it meets drink or your lips.


Make sure the tape is even. If it's not perfect, it's super easy to adjust. Use masking or painter's tape for best results.

, Once you have your kit, follow the instructions on the packaging to put it together. Some will require you to paint the parts and glue the figurines to the base. Once the scene is set, you will usually need to glue the glass (or plastic) dome to the base and then fill the dome with water (and snow or glitter) from a hole in the base. You will then use the stopper provided to seal the snow globe.

Decide on the type of vase you'd like.,
Buy jute rope.,
Hot glue one end of the jute ball of twine at the top mouth of the vase.,
Wind the jute ball tightly around the vase while holding the initial end in place (just in case).,
Work your way around and down the vase with the jute adding a drop or two of hot glue along the way.,
Complete the jute covering at the lowest point on the vase (not underneath the vase but close).",How to Design a Jute Covered Vase1," Would you prefer to use a jute-covered vase or bowl? Determine if you need to purchase a vase, a bowl or if you already have an old container or vase you can transform––the jute is very forgiving and will allow you to cover all manner of old containers so that nobody will suspect what's underneath originally.;
, Jute comes in a wide variety of colors so purchase a color that will complement the room or your design. If you need more hot glue tubes, pick them up at the craft or fabric store.


Find your sharpest pair of scissors to cut the jute. You’ll need to make a clean cut so the jute doesn’t unravel or rip.

, Hold the glued end in place until you're confident it had adhered to the glass.

, Use your fingers to push twine upward so you achieve a tight pattern.

, You don’t need to glue the entire jute rope, however it may be a good idea to add a drop every few rows to hold it into place.

,


Use sharp scissors to cut the jute and then add a large glob of glue to hold the end in place.

Sketch your design first on a piece of paper.,
Secure your stencil to the glass.,
Sketch the design onto the glass.,
Choose your paints.,
Prep the area.,
Start coloring.,
Remove paint with nail polish remover if corrections are needed.",How to Paint Wine Glasses2," If you draw the pattern on a piece of paper or tissue paper, this will allow you to insert it inside the glass, secure it, and use the pattern to transfer and paint over the design. Tissue paper will be easier to work with as it bends much more easily.


You by no means need to create a design that requires a sketch. Geometrical and abstract patterns are just as beautiful, if not more so. If it'd be helpful, use tape to devise a pattern on the outside of your glass; you can then easily paint around it. Same goes for the stem and base!

, There are so many products out there, it's tough to know where to get started. The simplest way is to sketch your design and secure it with tape on the inside of your glass. You have a couple more options, however:


Place your sketch inside your glass and fill it with something like a sock or quilt batting. The soft interior will keep it in place, intact.
Buy self-adhering stencils at your local craft supply store. If you can fathom its existence, it can be found. Stencils come in sticker form nowadays, and you can just plop them onto your glass and paint away.

, Use a fine point sharpie (or marker that will not wipe off) to sketch a design on the glass. If you don't like your sketch, you can use a q-tip or cotton ball dipped in rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to ""erase"" the marker or paint.


This outline will probably remain visible. If you want to go for a more of a ""One Stroke"" method, skip sketching directly on the glass, and just paint using the sketch underneath.

, As with stencils, it's easy to walk into the paint aisle and feel absolutely overwhelmed. There are a handful of varieties to choose from and the differences are really only nuanced -- they'll all create something pleasurable to the eye. What you choose is just a matter of current mood and taste.


Enamels (like Folk Art or Martha Stewart) are water-based and especially geared toward glass painting.They can handle the dishwasher if cured (not necessarily the microwave, however) -- but some require a primer and top coat (like PermEnamel), so note the label.Acrylics work, too. However, it generally depends on the quality of the paints you choose -- some are more prone to washing off. If you do go the acrylic route, spray a high-quality varnish on top (they have sparkly ones!) to secure the paint to the glass.There are acrylics that are designed more for glass painting. If acrylic is your jam, use this variety.


Regardless of what type of paint you end up using, you'll probably encounter air dry and heat dry forms. In general, the glasses that are baked (require heat drying) last longer.To add more spice to the mix, you'll also have the option of choosing transparent (light will pass through), opaque (light will not pass through), and frosted paints. Decisions, decisions.
They've officially thought of everything -- glass paint markers are available, too. They bake on and make even the most detailed of glasses beginner-doable., Though it should go without saying, paint isn't fun to pick off your favorite sweater or your grandma's mahogany table. Go change your clothes, and lay down several layers of newspaper or wax paper -- anything to protect those surfaces. And take the dog outside.


While you're at it, open the windows. Being high on paint fumes isn't the state you want to be in for this project!

, Glass painting methods number no fewer than canvas painting methods. This part is entirely up to you. But if you're looking for a little inspiration, here's a few jumping off points:


Create a marbleized glass by pouring your paint over your piece, top to bottom. Pour in a thin even layer, rotating the glass consistently. Alternate colors as desired. Liquid fill paints will be best for this method.Use just one color and pour on until completely covered to create a solid painted glass.


Use tape to make stripes. Just after you've painted between the stripes, take it off; if the tape is taken off when the paint is dry, you risk chipping the paint. If you have any quirks in your stripes, just take your craft knife and carefully chip away until the lines are straight.
Get polka-dotting. The blunt end of your paintbrush is great for dots, or you can use a dauber or spouncer. To do this effectively, never come in or go out at an angle. Always place your tool straight down and take it straight back up.
Use sponges. Whether it's a dish sponge or a sponge brush, you can create interesting, layered designs with a dab of paint -- little skill required.
Add colors on top of each other to create shading and highlighting. That's just painting 101.

Don't forget the stem and base! Half of your ""canvas"" isn't the actual glass (if you're using a wine glass). For the base, consider painting the underside to achieve an is-it-there-is-it-not-there look. You know the kind.

If you were wondering about paintbrushes, unless you're an avid painter, they're all pretty much the same. But if we're splitting hairs, the synthetic ones will be more stroke-y; natural-haired brushes will paint a smooth, complete picture., Resin-based paints are incredibly temporary until baked and can even be removed with warm water.If you absolutely must remove the paint, do so quickly.

"
"
Let it dry.,
Heat set the glass.,
Embellish your creation.",How to Paint Wine Glasses3," Allow the glass to dry for at least 24 hours before proceeding to the next step of heat setting. Stand them upside down on a soft surface such as a folded tea towel to allow them to dry. Try to keep them away from the kitchen or bathrooms, where moisture could affect the drying.


If you're air drying, it may need to be left to its lonesome for up to three weeks. Follow the instructions on the paint's label., If you chose the kind of paint that needs baking to be set, you've reached that time. The process is very straightforward and no, your glass won't melt!


Line a cookie sheet with aluminum foil.
Turn your oven to 350ºF (180ºC). There is no preheating required. The idea is to put the glass in a cold oven -- this will gradually increase heat as opposed to placing the glassware in a hot oven, which might cause the glassware to break.
Immediately put the glasses on the lined sheet and place in the oven.
Set a timer for 30 minutes. Turn off the heat after 20 minutes, but leave the glass in for a further 10 minutes. Then, remove the glasses after the 30 minutes is up.

Or, do as as instructed by the manufacturer on the label of the paints you've used (this is done to make the item washable).



, Since some of your glasses might be suitable to give away for birthdays and other occasions, you could fill them up with candy, confetti, or birthday horns, etc. They make for great pieces to be used and taken home.


Consider signing your name or adding the name of the recipient to the bottom of the glass. Add a dab of glue and secure on a bow. A gift too pretty to be wrapped!

Cut three pieces of fusing glass.,
Stack the clean glass pieces evenly on top of one another.,
Place the glass in a warm glass kiln making sure it is on a clean shelf, or use thin fire shelf paper to prevent the glass sticking to the shelf.

,
Bring the temperature up to about 500°F (260ºC) reasonably quickly.,
Close the vent, bring temperature up to about 1500°F (815ºC) and fuse the glass.,
Check after about five minutes to see if the glass is beginning to fuse.,
Open the glass kiln lid or door once the glass has fused, and vent the kiln until the temperature drops to about 1000°F (538ºC).,
Remove the pendant from the kiln when completely cool.

",How to Make a Stacked Fused Glass Pendant," Make one 1 x 1 1/2"" (2.5cm x 3.81cm) square, one 1 x 1 1/4"" (2.5cm x 3.17cm) square, and one 1 x 1"" (2.5cm x 2.5cm) square. The glass needs to be very clean; even if it looks clean, oils from your fingers or cutting oil can ruin your beautiful project!;
, This will allow the glass to move more or less evenly as it spreads to its natural thickness of about 1/4"" (0.635cm). The glass is now ready to be fused.

,, Hold for 5 minutes, then bring up to about 1000°F (538ºC).


Hold, with the kiln vented, to allow the burnt binder fumes from the shelf paper to escape.

, As this is a small stacked piece, it can be fused fairly quickly.

, When fully fused, the glass should be nicely rounded with no sharp edges and with a smooth top surface.

, Close the kiln and allow it to cool to room temperature. Be careful of the hot air escaping from the kiln when it is opened. Wear heatproof gloves and dark kiln safety glasses.

Find jars that you want to keep.,
Purchase jute webbing.,
Measure the circumference of the first jar.,
Cut the webbing to length.,
Repeat for as many jars as you're making.,
Place hot glue down one edge of the jute webbing.

,
Attach to the jar.,
Run another line of hot glue over the top of the glued on jute webbing.,
Wrap the rest of the webbing right around the jar and back onto the glue line.,
Done.,
Finished.

",How to Design a Jute Covered Vase2," Choose shapes that are appealing and will be large enough to hold the things you'd like to keep in them. If you haven't saved your own, ask your neighbor, a friend or family member for theirs. Some jars also end up in thrift stores, so you might be able to find some good ones there.

, This will wrap around the jar. The amount needed depends on how many jute jars you intend making. As for the width, this will depend on the end use. If you're using the jar for a vase or for stationery, then the webbing could cover all the way up. But if you're using it for a candle holder or to hold pretty pebbles, you'll probably only want it covered about halfway up.

, This will be the length of the webbing, plus an overlap allowance of 1/2 inch/12 mm.

, Check that it still fits properly by wrapping it around the jar.


If you don't want to cover the whole jar, cut the webbing down to half or three quarters the size of the jar.
If the webbing doesn't cover all of the jar and you want it to, do it in sections, carefully layered one on top of the other until the whole jar is covered.

, Or, skip to the next section if only making one.

,, Hold in place for a few seconds to ensure that it has set.

, Do this only at the edge, where it will overlap when wrapped.

, Once again, hold firmly in place for a few seconds to set.


If gluing more than one section of webbing, carefully align each new layer flush with the last glued layer, to avoid any glass glinting out from the join.

, As well as using this as a vase, you can now use the jar for various other purposes, such as:



A candle holder: Fill three quarters of the way with sand and place a tea light candle on top. (This only works with jute webbing done halfway up the jar)

Stationery holder: Add pencils, pens and other writing implements for ease of finding

Funky storage jar: Keep buttons, pebbles, craft bits and pieces, stationery pieces, etc. safely together in the jar

Gift: Give the jute jar/vase away as a gift. Create a label to say what it is and that it's handmade and wrap the label around the top of the jar using raffia.

Draw an eight-by-four inch rectangle on a clear plastic report cover.,
Fold the plastic along the lines to form a triangular shape.,
Slide the triangle into the cardboard and create your peephole.,
Cut out a four-inch square of plastic wrap.,
Fill the pouch with beads, sequins, and confetti.,
Place a square of waxed paper over the pouch.,
Decorate the outside of your kaleidoscope.,
Use your kaleidoscope.",How to Make a Kaleidoscope1," Cut it out, using scissors. Draw three horizontal lines across the rectangle, splitting it into three 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) pieces and one 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) piece.








Note that you'll need to make it this size to fit your paper towel roll.
To make these lines easier to fold later, you may wish to measure and trace these lines in marker first, then use a paper cutter or box cutter to lightly score these lines into the plastic. Do not cut completely through the plastic, however.;
, The quarter-inch strip should stay on the outside and act as a flap. Tape the strip along the edge using transparent tape, so the triangle hold its shape.







, Cut a paper towel roll down to 8 inches, the same size as your triangle. Slide the plastic triangle into the paper towel roll. To create your peephole, turn the paper towel tube on one end, standing straight up. Trace a circle around it on black construction or contact paper. Then, poke a hole through the center of the circle, using scissors or a sharp pencil, and making it large enough so you can see through it. Tape the circle over one end of the tube.








If you'd like, make the circle a little bit bigger. You can then cut tiny slits along the edges so the circle lies flat on the end. Then you have some wiggle room to work with and won't have tape on the visible part of your kaleidoscope.
And if there is tape that's visible, you can always cover it in glitter.

, Place the square of plastic wrap over the other end of the tube. Use your fingers to poke it down into the plastic triangle, until it forms a little pouch.







, Anything small and shiny will do the trick, but translucent objects are best. You also want different shapes and sizes. Your kaleidoscope won't be shoved in a drawer anytime soon if there's infinite variations as to what can be seen!








If this doesn't end up looking like you want it to look, you can always go back into your kaleidoscope and make adjustments!

, Place a four-inch square of waxed paper over the pouch and around the cardboard tube, sealing in the beads and sequins. Stretch a rubber band over both the waxed paper and the plastic wrap. Make sure it’s on tight so nothing spills out!









Trim the corners of the squares. This will make the kaleidoscope look neater. You can replace the rubber band with some sticky tape, if you like.

, You can use stickers, wrapping paper, contact paper (just be diligent in bubble prevention!), or construction paper. Some contact paper looks like wood, metal, or gold. But why stop at paper? You could add glitter or sequins on the outside, too!







, Hold the tube up to one eye, facing the light, and look through it. Turn it slowly -- what happens? It's your own light show! The light is bouncing back and forth against your report cover, creating this constantly changing display in front of your very eyes.








Take it away from your eye for a second, give it a quick, gentle shake, and put it back up to your eye. Just how different is what you're seeing? What happens if you do it again? Can you recreate anything?

Wash the shot glasses.,
Wipe the surfaces of the glass, both outside and inside.
,
Design the outside of the glass.,
Add any decorations if you want.,
Allow the decorating medium to dry if necessary.
,
Add quality potting soil and seeds (or plant) and water.,
Care for the plant.",How to Make Plant Pots with Shot Glasses," Whether freshly bought or used, soak the shot glass in a tub of steaming hot water and soap. Wash off the soap completely. Dry thoroughly before using.

,, This step is optional, especially as you might have purchased a shot glass that has a design or brand mark on it already. If you do choose to add a design, use glass suitable paint or markers to ensure that the design stays in place. Leave any design work to dry before proceeding to the next step.

Any design added should be simple. The addition of the decorations and plant risks overwhelming a complex design.

, In the image shown, a ribbon band, bow and a chenille butterfly are added to great effect. Use non-toxic glue when gluing on decorations, to prevent any harm to the plant.
,, Choose the plant wisely. It needs to be a plant that can tolerate slightly waterlogged soil as there is no drainage hole and it needs to be a plant that will tolerate the small growing space. (See ""Tips"" for a drainage hole suggestion.)

This idea works best with succulent plants and cacti as they can tolerate a small, drier growing environment, appreciate misting and won't be hassled out when you transplant them.

, Only mist the plant, to prevent over-watering; the frequency of watering depends on the plant you've chosen. If the plant outgrows the shot glass, transplant it to an appropriate pot and start again.

Wash the window thoroughly.,
Tape a border along the inside of the window frame, using painter's tape.,
Cover the interior walls of the work area with masking paper or plastic sheeting.,
Shake the frosting spray can for the suggested length, usually 1-2 minutes.,
Spray the window using large, back and forth motions to cover the surface evenly.,
Apply a second coat of frosting after your first coat has completely dried.,
Spray acrylic sealer onto the frosted window after it has completely dried.,
Remove the painter's tape carefully from the glass after the frosting has dried.",How to Frost Glass1," Scrub to remove all dust and debris from the surface.After washing, dry the window completely. Make sure there is no paper or fabric left behind on the surface or else this will affect the final appearance of the frosted glass.;
, This border will be the portion of window you don't want frosted.


Blue painter's tape. Painter's tape is specifically designed to endure wet applications. It has a weak adhesive allowing it to be easily removed.For windows with lattice work or muntin bars (strips of wood between the glass), cover the wood with tape.
If the 1-in. painter's tape width isn't a thick enough border, lay another piece alongside it. Use a tape measure to ensure that borders are symmetrical; uneven borders look bad.
If your window does not have a frame, simply tape along the outside edges until you have created a border.

, Use painter's tape to hold it in place.


Don't leave any openings or gaps where the spray could enter.
When working indoors, open doors and windows and turn on fans to help circulate fresh air. Consider wearing a particle mask to protect your nose and mouth. The spray fumes are hazardous to your health.Take the window outside, if possible. This ensures a healthy work space and decreases the likelihood of ""overspray,"" and frosting spray drifting onto other objects.

,


Find frosting spray at craft and home improvement stores.
While shaking the can, you should hear the small ball inside begin to rattle. Test spray on a small piece of cardboard.If it sprays correctly, prepare to frost your glass. If it is not spraying at a steady rate, continue shaking and testing in 1 minute intervals.

, Hold the frosting can at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) from from the window's surface to avoid splotches and runs.


Apply a light coating at first. It is easier to go back and add a second or third layer to even out the frosting, but it is difficult to remove gloppy or runny patches.
Expect 5-10 minutes for the frosting to become visible on the glass.

, Use the same back-and-forth motion to create a smooth frosted surface.


If necessary, apply a third or fourth layer of frosting until you get the desired effect. Follow the spray can's directions regarding the wait time required between coats.

, If you are satisfied with the appearance of the frosting, apply sealer.


Acrylic sealers protect glass from the elements such as moisture and dirt. The protective gloss coating is often permanent.If you are unhappy with the frosted surface after the sealant has already dried, you will need to scrape it off with a razor blade., Peel slowly to avoid accidentally removing the frosting.


If you worked indoors, remove the painter's tape cautiously. This will prevent removal of paint from the walls.
Use mineral spirits to clean any overspray from your hands and other objects. Do not use mineral spirits to clean items with paint or nice finishes, as this could damage the quality.

Gather the supplies you need in order to bend the acrylic with a heat gun.Sheet of acrylic large enough for your needs
A heat gun, which is an electrical tool that heats and softens a variety of materials
Scrap wood
Cutting tools, such as a Dremel saw, circular saw, table saw, and/or razor knifeA vise and clamps
Chinagraph pencil, also known as a grease pencil, or permanent marker
Acrylic glue and an applicator;
,
Determine the dimensions of what you are creating with the bent acrylic.,
Set your acrylic between two pieces of scrap wood, one of which is your jig, and clamp it all together using the vise.,
Prepare your heat gun for bending the acrylic.,
Repeat the heating process if you have additional bends to make in the sheet of acrylic.,
Trace the sides of your newly bent piece of acrylic in order to make the side pieces.,
Set the bent acrylic piece and the cut sides together with acrylic glue and the applicator.",How to Bend Acrylic1,", If you are creating an enclosure, then you need to do the math to determine its size and where you need to bend it to make your desired shape.You may need tools such as a ruler or other measuring stick, a square, a compass, or a protractor to find these dimensions.
Once you have calculated your dimensions, mark them up on the acrylic so that you know where to cut. A Chinagraph pencil or permanent marker works well, but the marker will not be able to be removed.
If you want any holes in your acrylic enclosure, it is better to drill or cut them into it before bending, as this process is easier while the acrylic is still flat.

, Cut the jig to help you bend the acrylic to the correct calculations, if necessary.This is where you can use the circular or table saw, if you are cutting a jig. A jig is a box or frame meant for holding a material and guiding a machine tool to the material.The jig will be cut at a particular height and and its edge at a particular angle, based on your calculations, so that you bend the acrylic correctly.
Make sure you have a spare piece of scrap wood to help you with the heat bending process. You will use it to push on the acrylic while it is heated.

, Heating is a slow process in order to make sure that you get a straight bend in the acrylic.Use the spare piece of flat scrap wood to push the acrylic back and down while you aim the heat gun at the acrylic. Make your pressure on the acrylic as even as possible while you push.
Move the heat gun slowly side-to-side while you push back and down on the acrylic.
Note that the acrylic will likely bend slowly at first, but the more heated it becomes, the more quickly in will bend. You may eventually need to only push down with the scrap wood in order to achieve a straight bend.

, This will be necessary if you are making an enclosure out of the acrylic, for example, but it will not be necessary in every situation. If you have no further bends to make, then move on to the next step, or you may be done with your project at this time.


It will be helpful to allow each bend to completely cool before going onto the next bend so that you do not lose the initial bend.

, Lay the bent acrylic on its side on a new piece of flat acrylic and trace the sides using a permanent marker or Chinagraph pencil. Cut the side pieces out using a Dremel saw or razor knife when you are done tracing.It is important to trace each side of the bent acrylic. Do not assume that both sides are the exact same shape.

, This can be a tricky process.


Be very careful while bending the acrylic and cutting your side pieces, as the acrylic glue requires perfect seams in order set correctly.The acrylic glue requires at least five minutes to set, so it is recommended to clamp the enclosure together to help it set correctly."

Cut the mirror into 3 strips that are 1 ½"" wide.,
Lay the 3 strips side by side and upside down.,
Cut your cardboard roll to the length of your mirror plus 1/3"" (.85 cm).,
Create your peephole.,
Create your plastic lenses.,
Assemble the inside of your kaleidoscope.,
Decorate your tube.,
Put your kaleidoscope to good use.",How to Make a Kaleidoscope2," That's about 3.8 centimeter (1.5 in). The best kind of ""mirrors"" for this are acrylic -- or those cheap little locker mirrors they sell everywhere when it's back-to-school season. They're not really mirrors, so they're fairly easy to cut into with a box or paper cutter.

, Be sure to leave a small gap between each strip. ""Small gap"" here means about 1/8"" (.3 cm). Then, tape the mirrors together (along the gaps), bend them into a triangle shape, and set aside.

, This is easiest with a box cutter, but scissors will do. Just be careful not to stab yourself!

, Here's how:


Place one of the circular ends of your tube flat on a piece of paper -- contact paper is best, but construction paper or even gift wrap will work, too.
Cut about 1"" (2.5 cm) around the traced circle; with that extra 1"", cut little notches around the circle so it bends more easily (it'll sort of look like a firework).
Cut a triangle or circle in the center of the paper to view through. Center the cardboard tube on top of your circle and secure the edges with tape (unless you're using contact paper, of course).

, Get an empty plastic container or two and trace two circles using the end of your tube (permanent marker is easiest to see). With an object that's about ½"" (1.25 cm) larger than your tube, draw around the previous ones. Then, cut around the each of the larger circles with scissors. Lenses!


With one of the circles, cut notches all the way to the inside of the smaller circle -- this'll be called lens 1. It should sort of resemble a gear. With the other circle, cut notches to the outside tracing of the smaller circle — this'll be lens 2. Lay them flat against the table and bend the notches upwards.

, To begin, slide your triangular mirror inside the cardboard tube. Take lens 1 and place it inside your tube against the edges of the mirror, notches facing up; this should form a sort of makeshift pouch. Place your selected beads, sequins, glitter, gems, and/or confetti on top of this plastic lens. Cap your gems using lens 2, notches facing down, and use masking tape to secure it all together.

, The easiest way to make this kaleidoscope look as impressive as possible is contact paper -- so long as you work out the bubbles! But you can also use construction paper or even gift wrap to jazz it up. And then add on some glitter or stickers if the urge strikes!


If there's some tape exposed where you secured your lens, cover it in glitter! It's easy and mess-free if you pour your glitter in the crease of a folded piece of paper. Just coat the very tip of your kaleidoscope in glue and place it in the crease, rotating it around until it's fully coated.

, Done! Now all you have to do is hold it up to the light and look through it. The light bounces off the mirrors, creating the kaleidoscope effect you see inside. What happens when you jostle it? When you turn it slowly? Can you ever create the same image twice?

, Get a piece of foam rope that's half an inch in diameter. Cut it into one inch pieces. You will need three of these for the kaleidoscope.







, The petri dish should be 60 mm by 15 mm and should be made out of plastic. Use PVC cement to attach the petri dish to the tube, being careful not to get any cement on the dish.








You can either leave the glass clear to create a ""world view"" kaleidoscope or you can create a colored kaleidoscope by drawing on the inside face of the petri dish using colored permanent markers before you attach it the the PVC tube., Gather the three mirrors, long sides together and gently fold them into a triangle with the shiny sides facing in. Make sure you have removed any protective film first. Neatly tape the mirrors together using transparent tape, so that the edges of the three mirrors form an equilateral triangle.

Cover the door frame and the individual muntins with tape.,
Shake the spray can for 1-2 minutes.,
Spray the glass with a slow, sweeping motion.,
Remove the tape from the door frame, muntins, and glass.",How to Frost Glass2," Face the door so that the surfaces you intend to frost are facing up.


A garage or backyard patio are ideal areas to frost glass. This will prevent inhalation of hazardous fumes and limit the amount of accidental spray.

, Any residue left on the window will appear in your frosting and will not look as professional.


Even if there is no dirt or residue on your windows, you should still wipe it down to ensure that it is dry. Frosting will not adhere well to windows that are moist or oily.

, One tape edge should always be against the muntins (wooden frames separating panes).


Since individual window panes are typically small on glass paneled doors, stay within the 1-inch margin of the painter's tape. Using too big of borders will allow more light in but will also reduce the surface area of the frosting.

, The only visible parts of the door should be the glass surfaces.


Be sure to overlap tape strips and press firmly to avoid penetration of overspray to the wood.

, Though each can's label advises a specific time, the spray generally requires just a couple of minutes for preparation.


Spray some frosting onto something clear, like a piece of plastic, before applying to your window. Make sure that the nozzle sprays steadily and evenly. This will ensure that your frosted glass is smooth and consistent.

, Hold the spray can about 1 foot (0.3 m) from the surface so that the coat is light and even.


Pay attention to the pressure you put on the nozzle, as this will affect how much and how quickly frosting is sprayed. Try to apply enough pressure to spray a steady stream, and do so in short bursts. This will help you apply a light coat that can be sprayed over with another light coat, if necessary.
Let the first coat completely dry before spraying on a second coat. Apply each successive coat with the lightest possible amount, even if you have to spray on a third or fourth layer. Gradually applying frosting will limit areas with heavy paint and blemishes., Be sure that the frosting has dried first before removing the tape, as this could damage the outline.


The drying process typically takes about 5 minutes, though you should allow an extra few minutes just to be certain. Also take into account how many layers you've applied and how heavy, as these factors will also affect drying time.
If you are still uncertain about whether or not the paint has dried, leave it for half an hour in which the paint should most likely be dried by then.
Avoid touching the frosted area to test its wetness. This will create a smudge in the frosting and will require more layers to repair it.

, Keep in mind that complex designs will be difficult to create with frosting spray, though it is possible with a lot of time and patience.

, Use a razor knife to cut out the design, making sure to leave the outline intact.


Keep in mind when cutting that you are creating a large stencil so you will want an inverted image.

, This will prevent any dirt smudges or flakes from appearing in your design.


If your window has a filmy coating, clean it with vinegar first in order to strip away the oils. Window frosting spray will not stick to a window that is oily.

, Make sure it is positioned exactly where you want the design to be.


Tape around the perimeter of the stencil to create a strong hold. If the stencil should slip when the window frosting spray is drying, it will cause the image to smear.

, The closer you are to the glass, the thicker and darker the frosting will be.


If you are using multiple colors in the design, spray the colors one at a time and allow each one to dry before spraying the next color.

,


You can speed up the drying process by directing a fan at the window, making sure it is on the low setting to prevent the stencil from shifting.

, Slowly peel off the tape while holding the stencil in place to prevent it from sliding across the image. Lift the stencil off the glass in a fluid motion.

Gather the materials that you need in order to bend a piece of acrylic with a strip heater.,
Calculate the dimensions of your craft or enclosure, if necessary.,
Mark the location of the fold on the acrylic with the Chinagraph pencil or permanent marker.,
Cut and assemble your jig to the correct shape and dimensions you need using scrap wood.,
Set the sheet of acrylic across the rests on the strip heater and turn it on.,
Remove the heated, flexible acrylic from the strip heater and move it to the jig.,
Repeat the heating process as necessary for any other bends in the sheet of acrylic.,
Trace the sides of your bent acrylic in order to create side pieces for an enclosure.",How to Bend Acrylic2,"


A strip heater, which is a tool that has a heating element along the length of it and rests on which to lay the material you want to heat so that they are not directly on the intense heating elementSheet of acrylic that is large enough for your needs
Chinagraph pencil, also known as a grease pencil, or permanent marker
A jig, which is a box or frame meant for holding holding a material and guiding a machine tool to the materialScrap wood
Cutting tools, such as a Dremel saw, circular saw, table saw, and/or razor knife
Clamps
Acrylic glue and an applicator

, Cut down the sheet of acrylic to the size or shape that you need for your project using a Dremel saw or razor knife.


It may be helpful to overestimate your dimensions, since you will be heating and bending the acrylic. Heating may cause a slight change in where the bend lies and how it fits into other pieces.

, This is where you will heat the acrylic on the strip heater.Make sure that your line exactly follows the shape you desire. If you want a straight line, make sure it is perfectly straight. If you need it to be angled, then make sure the line runs at the correct angle. The line will still appear on the acrylic after it is heated, when you need to bend it.
The Chinagraph pencil markings can be removed later. Remember that permanent marker will not come off.

, You will put the heated acrylic in the jig to help it form to the right shape.


Use the circular or table saw for this process. You may need to use wood glue or nails to assemble your jig into the shape you need, depending on how you plan to bend the acrylic. For example, you might adhere two pieces of scrap wood together at a 90-degree angle along their long sides if you want your acrylic bent in that shape. If you need a more acute or obtuse angle, then you will likely need to cut the edges of your scrap wood at slight angles instead of perfectly straight across.
Set the jig aside until you need it. Be sure to leave it close by and easily accessible.
Have a piece of scrap wood nearby, as well, for helping to form the shape of the bent acrylic in the jig.

, Be sure that the marked line is above the heating element.Turn the sheet of acrylic over on the heating element every 30-60 seconds in order to avoid damaging it. Wear gloves as you do this to avoid burning your hands.
Only keep the acrylic on the strip heater long enough for it to become flexible, at which point it is ready for you to bend.
It may be helpful to clamp the acrylic in place while it is being heated so that only the marked area is heated and the sheet of acrylic does not move., Remember to wear gloves so that you do not burn your hands.


Bend the acrylic to match the angle of the jig. Then, set the acrylic into the jig so that it will form to that angle as it cools.
Set the flat piece of scrap wood on top of the acrylic to keep it in place in the jig while it cools, so that it forms to the correct angle. You could also use clamps, if you have your jig set up on a table surface with room to apply the clamps.
Do not remove the acrylic from the jig until it has cooled, or it might lose its new shape.

, If you have no other bends to make in the acrylic, then move onto the last step, or you might be done with your project.


Remember to wait until the initial bend in the acrylic has completely cooled before attempting another bend in the same sheet of acrylic. Moving it while it is still warm and flexible will cause it to lose the bend.

, You will need to trace them onto an additional piece of flat acrylic.


Remember to trace both sides of your newly bent acrylic, as they may not be the exact same shape and size.
Cut out the side pieces using a Dremel saw or a razor knife. Take care not to crack the acrylic, which may cause you to have to start over.
Fit the side pieces into the bent acrylic to create your enclosure. Secure the sides with acrylic glue and an applicator, and use clamps to hold them in place to set for several minutes.

Select suitable jewelry.,
Select or purchase a plain mirror.,
If you plan on hanging the bedazzled mirror, check the hanging apparatus on the back of it.,
Sketch or plan the mirror's border design.,
Disassemble your jewelry as needed.,
Prepare the work space.,
Glue the costume jewelry to your mirror.,
Allow the bedazzled mirror to dry while still laying on the flat surface.,
Display the bedazzled mirror.",How to Bedazzle a Mirror With Costume Jewelry," Be sure that it's okay to use all the pieces you select (you don't want to be gluing a family heirloom to the mirror) and that they can be arranged around the mirror in a stylish and interesting way. You will need to decide whether you'd like color continuity or just a jumble of colors and whether size uniformity matters or not. It really depends on how eclectic a result you're happy with, what pieces are available for use and the décor where you'll be hanging the mirror. For example, the room you plan to house the mirror in may have a warm color scheme but your jewelry is darker, in which case, you'll need to find different pieces.


Other bits and pieces that align well with the costume jewelry can be included too, such as beads, buttons, rhinestones, etc.
Group jewelry based on design. You may have certain eras of vintage jewelry (such as pieces from the 1940’s versus items from the 1970’s) that may not work harmoniously together.
Avoid choosing pieces that are flaking or chipped unless you're willing to paint or decorate them back to good condition. Broken pieces might actually be okay if you can glue them back into their original formation or if the broken pieces actually look okay separated.
If you don't have enough pieces of costume jewelry of your own, there are plenty of budget sources, such as local thrift stores, online auctions and live auctions of estate items.;
, If you already own a mirror that you don't know what to do with, this might be the perfect solution. Otherwise, head down to a mirror supplier, a local garage/yard sale or thrift store and purchase a new or used mirror that could be massively improved. There's no need to spend a lot––this mirror will turn into something spectacular after you've glued on the costume jewels. Importantly, this mirror needs to be able to accommodate the amount of jewels you intend to use, and their size.


Be certain that there is sufficient space for the mirror in your house. That said, it is actually recommended that you start with a small mirror for your first project, as you're more likely to find it an easy starter project.
Some frames around mirrors may accommodate the costume jewelry, while others might not. This will require sizing up the benefits of a framed or non-framed mirror at the time of purchase. Which type will look better with the type of jewelry you own?

, The mirror will need to be able to support the added weight you're going to glue onto it and it's easiest to deal with this aspect before adding the costume jewelry. If the mirror already has strong hanging hook or wire on the back, that's great. However, if not (for example, it only has string stapled to the back of it), you'll need to strengthen it. The recommended hanging equipment is eye hooks with wire threaded through. This will provide the maximum strength needed.

, Once you're happy with the jewelry pieces and have the mirror, it's time to plan. Planning will help you to decide for sure which pieces are going to be useful and which need to be broken down further or not included at all. If you're not feeling particularly inspired, it's recommended that you do an online image search for ""jeweled mirrors"", which will return many ideas to inform your design.


Place the jewels around the frame of the mirror to get an idea of how it will eventually look.
Move pieces around and create designs until you are satisfied. Think symmetry when putting together two pieces that are the same (same color, shape, size, style, etc.), such as aligning them in exactly the spot on either side of the mirror.
If you have many pieces, you may want to label each piece with a small piece of tape and a corresponding number to avoid forgetting the placement.
Create a map on a piece of paper so you will know where each piece will eventually go. Alternatively, take a digital photograph of your end design, for ease of reference as you begin gluing the pieces into place.

, In many cases, you'll need to remove findings and other elements from the costume jewelry, just so that it sits flat and glues on tightly. In some cases, you might even need to break down certain pieces of jewelry into smaller elements (your planning should have revealed where this is needed). To remove findings, use a wire cutter and needle nose pliers.


Remove any findings that will simply get in the way, such as the studs/fasteners on earrings, brooch pins, settings around jewels, etc.
If a jewel is of especial interest but the setting is broken or undesirable, remove the jewel with care.
Be careful, especially handling older pieces, which may be particularly delicate.
Place discarded chains or jewelry pieces in a bowl or separate area Don’t automatically toss what you may not think you need––you never know until the mirror is complete and even then, these pieces may come in handy for a different craft project.

, Lay down newspaper to collect wayward drips when making the border.


Lay the mirror on a flat surface. Make sure the surface is very sturdy and is an easy-to-access work area.






Place your design plan next to your work project for ease of following.






For a glue gun rest, use a tin lid, piece of foil or similar item to rest the glue gun in/on between use, to avoid a build-up of drips on your work surface.







, The easiest way to add the costume jewelry to the mirror is using a hot glue gun. However, you can also use rubber cement or liquid nails, especially for any items that don't seem to stay put with just the hot glue gun backing. To apply:

Place a dab of glue on the back of the jewelry piece. Then gently press it down against the glass or frame in the position shown by your design.






Hold in place for a few seconds until it adheres to the mirror.






Continue around the mirror, taking care to shift items to their exact position before the glue sets.






Infill any gaps with small items such as buttons, broken pieces of jewelry, beads, etc., if desired. Alternatively, leave the original surface beneath to shine through.







, Leave the mirror on the surface for up to 24 hours to ensure the glue has completely dried.

, If hanging, ensure that the wall mount is strong enough for the mirror before hanging. If not, replace it first. Have another person help you to hang the mirror, holding it underneath while you check that it's level, etc. This will also help should the wall mount prove unsteady––your helper can catch the mirror if it falls. Once you're happy with the placement of the mirror, stand back and admire the final result!


If your mirror is going to lean against a wall, sit in a stand or has its own stand, again be sure to test that the placement is level and safe for the mirror before walking away.

Make the base of the basket.,
Bend the reeds.,
Split a center spoke.,
Weave the basket.,
Foot the base.,
Continue weaving.,
Pack the base.,
Finish the top of the basket.,
Trim the basket.,
Make the rim.",How to Make Baskets1," You'll need to lay out 5 reeds parallel to one another, with about 3/8ths of a space between them. Weave a sixth reed perpendicularly through the other 5. Bring the sixth reed over the first reed, under the second, over the third, under the fourth and over the fifth reed. Weave 4 more reeds in this manner, making sure that they are parallel to the sixth reed.Ensure that the squares formed by the base weaving are no bigger than 3/8 inch (.9 cm).;
, Bend the reeds that stick out from the square base into an upwards position. These bent reeds are called spokes. Bending them will make it easier to weave and these spokes will act as the supports for the basket.

, Split one end of either the third or eighth spoke, starting where it comes out from under the last spoke to cross it. You will now have eleven spokes. You'll be putting the weaver into the split.

, Put the tapered end (the smaller end) of a weaver reed into the split spoke and hold it in place with a clothespin. Keep the weaver reed near the base of the basket and weave, by going over one spoke and under the next.


If you're going for a square shape, hold the base corners together with clothespins. This will help maintain the shape of the base.
Continue to attach and weave new reeds through the spokes for 3 or 4 rows, depending on the desired height of the basket. Each new reed should be stacked above the reed woven before it.
Do your best to make the weave snug and tight, but not too tight or you can screw up the base of the basket. You, also, want to make sure that the weave isn't too loose.

, This means closing up those square holes that are still in the base. Starting in the left corner of your basket, take the corner spoke and tug it gently. Tug more firmly on the second spoke. You want to tug quite firmly on the middle spoke because this will create an arch in the bottom of the basket. Move to the 4th spoke and tug gently again.


Straighten your spokes and repeat on all 4 sides of the basket, until the holes in the base are closed.

, Keep attaching and weaving new reeds through the spokes. Make sure that you don't pull too hard on the corners, because that will make your spokes bend inward and you'll lose your basket's shape.


You also don't want your corners to be too loose, which can happen if you aren't keeping your spokes upright and parallel while you weave.
Stop weaving once you've reached your desired height.

, Push or pull the woven rows down towards the base as you weave. Ensure that there is no space between the base and the rows. Start pressing or pulling from the base and move up to the newer reeds as you go.


A properly packed basket should have a nicely arched base, straight, parallel spokes, properly spaced corners, and tight weaver rows.

, Stop weaving your last reed after you have woven 4 spokes past the split spoke. Taper the reed with scissors, moving from the fourth spoke to the end of the reed. Weave until all of the final reed has been woven into the spokes.

, Cut the spokes with scissors. The spokes should be 1/2 to 2 inches (1.3 to 5 cm) higher than the last woven reed. Fold the spokes towards the inside of the basket over the top row of reeds. Insert the end of each spoke into the third row from the top. Ensure that each spoke lies flat against the inside of the basket.

, You'll wrap a reed around the top row of the basket and pin it to the basket with a clothespin. Now, anchor the new reed by weaving its bottom end into the top few rows inside the basket. This reed is called the lacer.


Bring the lacer up and over the reed pinned to the basket and insert it through the front of the basket into the woven rows. Now pull the lacer inside the basket.
Continue wrapping the lacer around the pinned reed, circling the circumference of the basket.
Glue the end of the lacer inside the basket.

You can cut your own willow or buy dried willow shoots from a craft store.You'll need a great big bundle of thick, medium and thin shoots for the different parts of the basket. Make sure you have plenty of long, thin shoots - the longer the better, so you don't have to add new ones as often.
If you cut your own willow shoots, you'll need to dry them before you use them. Willow shoots shrink when they dry the first time. Lay them out to dry for several weeks before using.;
, In order to use willow shoots to weave, you'll need to rehydrate them to make them pliable. Soak the shoots in water for a few days, until they will easily bend without breaking.

, Choose several thick shoots that will serve as the basket's base. Use a hand pruner to cut 8 pieces of willow of equal lengths. The size of your base willow pieces will determine the circumference of your basket's bottom.


For a small basket, cut each length to 30 centimeter (11.8 in).
For a medium basket, cut each length to 60 centimeter (23.6 in).
For a large basket, cut each length to 90 centimeter (35.4 in).

, Start by laying one piece in front of you on your work surface. Use a very sharp knife to make a 5 centimeter (2.0 in) vertical slit in the center of the willow piece. Do the same with three more of the base pieces, so that you have 4 pieces with slits in the middle.

, This is the foundation of the basket base. Line up the 4 slitted pieces so that the slits are adjacent. Thread the 4 remaining pieces through the slits so that they lie flat and are perpendicular to the slitted pieces. You now have a cross shape composed of the 4 slitted pieces threaded through with the other 4 base pieces. This is called a slath. Each limb of the slath is called a spoke.

, Now it's time to actually start weaving your basket! Find two long, thin shoots of similar length. Insert the ends of the shoots into the left edge of the horizontal slit in your slath, so that the small shoots extend outward next to one of the spokes. These two thinner shoots are called ""weavers."" Weavers are woven around the spokes to create the basket shape.

, ""Pairing"" is a type of weaving that uses two weavers, creating a secure base for your basket. Separate the weavers and bend them to the right over the adjacent spoke. Place one weaver over the spoke and one weaver under the spoke and gather them on the right side of the spoke. Now bring the bottom weaver up over the next spoke on the slath, and bring the top weaver under the spoke. Turn the slath and keep weaving, bringing the weaver that is now the bottom weaver over the next spoke, and the top weaver under the spoke. Keep pairing around the 4 spokes until you've created 2 rows.


Make sure each twist in the weave goes in the same direction.
Weave tightly so that the rows lie snugly next to each other.

, The third time around, it's time to separate the individual spokes to form the round shape of you basket bottom. Now, instead of pairing around the grouped spokes, separate them and pair around each one individually using the exact same weaving method.


It might help to first bend each spoke outward so that they fan out like bicycle spokes. Ensure each spoke is separated by the same amount of space before you start weaving.
Continue pairing around the spokes until the basket base has reached the diameter you want.

, When you run out of length and need to add a new weaver, select one as close as possible to the side of the old weaver. Use a knife to create a pointed tip on the new weaver. Insert it between the weave of the last two rows and bend it to follow the path of the old weaver. Make sure it's securely in place, then use the hand pruner to trim off the end of the old weaver. Continue weaving using the new weaver.


Don't replace more than one weaver at a time. Replacing two or more weavers in the same place could create a weak spot in the basket.

, Choose 8 long, medium-sized willow shoots to serve as the basket's ""stakes."" These are the vertical pieces that form the structure of the sides of the basket. Use your knife to sharpen the ends of the stakes into points. Insert a stake alongside each of your spokes, pushing each one down into the weave as close to the center as possible. Bend the stakes upward so that they are pointing toward the sky. Use the hand pruner to trim the spokes back so that they're level with the edge of the weave, then tie the stakes together at their tips to keep them in place.

, This weave requires three weavers, which are woven among the stakes to set them in position. Find three long, thin shoots. Sharpen the ends into points. Insert the shoots into the base of the basket on the left side of three consecutive stakes. Now do two rows of the weave as follows:


Bend the far left weaver to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front.
Take the next far left weaver and bend it to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front.
Continue weaving this way, always starting with the far left weaver, until you have two rows of three rod wale.
Untie the stakes at the top.

, Find 8 long, thin shoots. Use your knife to sharpen the ends into points. Insert one weaver into the basket behind a stake. Bend it over the next stake to the left, pass it behind the stake to the left of that one, and pass it back to the front. Now insert a second weaver behind the stake to the right of the starting point of your first weaver and do the same - pass it over the stake to the left, under the stake to the left of that one, and back to the front. Continue adding weavers this way until there is one weaver next to each stake.


When you insert the last two weavers, you'll need to lift up the first weavers a bit to make room to add the last weavers underneath. Use an awl or a long nail.
This type of weaving is called French Randing. It's a popular weave that results in even, upright sides.

, Take a weaver and pass it in front of the stake to the left, then behind the stake to the left of that, and bring the end out to the front. Take the next weaver to the right of the starting weaver and pass it in front of the stake to the left, then behind the stake to the left of that, and bring the end out to the front. Continue weaving this way around the whole basket, always starting with the next weaver to the right.


When you get back to the start, you'll see that there are two weavers behind the last two stakes. Both weavers need to be woven around the stakes. Do the bottom weaver first, then do the top weaver. For the last stake, do the bottom weaver first, then the top weaver.
Continue randing until you've built up the sides as high as you'd like them to go, then trim the tips of the weavers.

, Find three long, thin shoots. Sharpen the ends into points. Insert the shoots on the left side of three consecutive stakes. Now do one row of waling as follows:


Bend the far left weaver to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front.
Take the next far left weaver and bend it to the right in front of two stakes. Pass it behind the third stake and out to the front.
Continue weaving this way, always starting with the far left weaver, until you have a row of three rod wale.

, Bend one of the stakes to the right and pass it behind the first two stakes. Pass it in front of the third and fourth stakes. Pass it behind the fifth stake, then pass it back to the front. Repeat with the next stake to the right of your starting stake.


The last two stakes won't have other stakes to weave around, since they'll all be woven into the rim. Instead of weaving around stakes, follow the same pattern but thread the tip in and out of the border.
Cut the tips of the woven stakes even with the side of the basket.

, Find a thick shoot to use as the base. Bend it over the basket, holding the ends in place, to find out how high you want the handle to be. Cut it to size, leaving several inches of extra length on each side. Sharpen the ends into points and insert them into the basket next to two stakes directly opposite each other.

, Sharpen the ends and insert them deep into the weave so that they lay right next to each other.

, Gather the shoots and wrap them around the handle like a ribbon until you reach the other end of the handle. Make sure the shoots lie flat right next to each other. Tuck the tips under the top of the woven rim.

, Working in the other direction, wrap the shoots around the handle to fill the the gaps where it isn't already covered by the first set of shoots. Keep wrapping the handle until you reach the other side, then tuck the ends into the top of the woven rim.

, Insert a thin shoot into the weave alongside one side of the handle. Bend toward the handle and wrap the base of the handle several times to secure the wrapped shoots in place. Keep wrapping tightly until the base of the handle is secure, then pass the end of the shoot under the last wrap and pull it tight, then trim the tip. Secure the other side of the handle the same way.

Start by understanding some basic terms:



Weaver - these are the basket strands that weave through the spokes; they are lighter, thinner and more flexible than the spokes, to enable them to be woven in and out;

Spoke - these are the strands that stand upright and form the side supports of the basket; they are much stiffer than the weavers and are strong.,
Be familiar with under-and-over-weaving.,
Note that double weaving is the same form but two weavers are used at once.,
Note that pairing may be used with an odd or even number of spokes.,
Identify the triple twist.",How to Understand Basic Basket Weaving Techniques,";
, This is the most commonly used technique. It is also the simplest. The illustration indicates its form.

, This is an effective weave on large surfaces, and in bands or patterns of the same or a contrasting colour on plain rattan baskets.

, Two weavers are started behind two succeeding spokes, and crossed between them, so that what was the under weaver becomes the upper weaver each time.

, Here, three weavers are placed behind three consecutive spokes, starting with the back one, over two and under one spoke, each on its way to the back of the third spoke being laid over the other two weavers. In turning up the sides of large baskets where separate spokes or additional spokes have been inserted, or as a strong top for scrap baskets, this weave is invaluable.

Make your newspaper sticks.,
Make the base.,
Begin weaving.,
Make the newspaper stick longer.,
Finish the basket.,
Paint it.",How to Make Baskets2," You'll use these rolled up sections of newspaper as the spokes and weavers for your basket. Get a thin stick, like a thin knitting needle or a pine skewer or 3mm dowel.Cut the newspaper in half horizontally and then again horizontally.
Place the stick at a corner of the piece of newspaper at an acute angle to the newspaper. Start rolling the newspaper around the stick, making sure that you're doing so tightly.
When you've rolled it all the way to the other corner, glue it onto the newspaper roll to hold it in place. Remove the dowel or knitting needle.
One end will usually be a bit narrower than the other on the newspaper sticks, but that's how it is supposed to look. When you're weaving you'll stick the narrower section of one newspaper stick into another to make them longer.

, Cut out two rectangular pieces of cardboard whatever size you want your basket to be. On one side of one of the cardboard pieces, put double sided tape. Lay out your newspaper sticks along the sides (you'll want to do about 13 on the long side and 7 on the short size).


Always use an odd number of sticks when making your base.
Use double sided tape on the second piece of cardboard and press into place a piece of fabric, whatever color you'd like. Put glue on the side that won't be facing out and glue the two pieces of cardboard (one with the fabric and one with the sticks) together. Put something heavy on them and leave to dry (about and hour).

, Start at one of the corners. Take a newspaper stick (a weaver) and fold it in half. Thread it around the corner stick. Using each half of the weaver weave around the upright sticks, with one half of the stick and the other half in back.


Keep the upright sticks parallel to one another and pulled upright, and keep the weavers pulled tight. You don't want them too loose.
At the corners you'll want to do an extra twist (over and under) before continuing the twist down the next side.

, As you reach the end of a tube, you'll need to add another stick to it, so that you can keep going. This is a lot easier than it sounds! All you have to do is insert the narrow end of the second stick into the first and push it in enough that it is secure.

, Once you've added rows until you've reached the height you want, it's time to finish the basket. This is very easy. Cut the leftover upright newspaper sticks to about 1 inch (2.54 cm).


For every other upright stick you'll fold into down into the basket and glue it in place. Use a clothespin to dry it in place.
For the sticks you didn't fold into the basket, you'll fold down on the outside and weave into the upper part of the basket.

, This is a completely optional step, as newspaper baskets look cool just as they are, but you can also paint them a color of your choosing. You could use a white acrylic paint and add a tinted varnish (which makes them look like a more 'authentic' basket), or you could use a bright, bold spray paint."

Start with an empty, ""naked"" basket.,
Clean the basket.,
Examine the basket for any broken slats or reeds.,
Select the stain product and color you will apply to the basket.,
Dip your brush into the stain, allowing any excess stain to drip back into the can.,
Repeat the procedure on the interior sides (or walls) of the basket.,
Move on to the exterior of the basket.,
Examine the basket, looking for any bare areas that stain did not trickle through the reeds.,
Set the basket aside or fashion a hook/hanger from a wire coat hanger and suspend it to thoroughly dry.

",How to Give New Life to a Faded Wicker Basket," (Remove any ties or ribbons, artificial flowers or other decorative items that may be tied, wired, or glued to the basket. Remove all contents from inside the basket.);
, Give the basket a good brushing with a small household brush to remove soil or dust. (Do not use a dusting spray or furniture polish. If the basket has excess soil, wash it with ordinary dish detergent in warm water. Allow it to thoroughly dry – inside and out – before you apply the new finish.)

, Repair them if you’re able with carpenter’s glue, raffia, wire or any product compatible with the fiber content of the basket.

, (See tips.) Stir the stain (or shake it) thoroughly to mix the colorant throughout the can.

, Beginning on the inside and on the bottom of the basket, apply the stain. Start with back and forth strokes across the reeds, then ""push"" the brush bristles into the reeds, forcing stain between the reeds. Yes, the stain will drip through the bottom of the basket. Reload your brush as needed.

, (For an easier reach, lay the basket on its side; apply stain to the new ""bottom"" side, periodically repositioning the basket as needed to completely stain the interior.)

, Stain the bottom first, then the exterior sides of the basket. If your basket has a handle, do the handle last.

, Tap additional stain into those missed areas with the brush.

Wrap the fabric strips around the clothesline in a spiral.,
Begin coiling the clothesline into the shape you'd like the finished piece to be.,
Machine sew a zigzag stitch across the space between one wrap and the next.

,To create walls, simply tilt the finished coil up as you sew.",How to Make Clothesline Coil Baskets," It may be circular or oblong, and it may be flat or have sides that come up. Really the only requirement is that you be able to get your sewing machine inside to stitch it together.
, A ruler and a rotary cutter will help with this process., When you reach the end of one strip, simply start the next. There is no need to finish the edges. You can wrap as you go and use a pin to hold the end in place while you stitch the coils together. Make sure each wrap overlaps the previous one.

, For a round piece, simply coil the rope into a spiral. For an elongated or oblong piece, start by folding the clothesline back onto itself in a straight line, then build the coil working out from that.,,"

Pull each piece of yarn across the opening of the box and tape it securely to the bottom.
,Secure the top of the warp to the loom with tape.",How to Weave Hemp1,",, Setts are how the vertical yarn, or warp, are held in place on the loom. The spacing between the setts depends on the thickness of the hemp yarn you are using.

For thin yarn, the sett should be 5 to 6 ends per inch (epi).
For thicker yarn, the setts should be 4 epi. For example, if you are working with thick hemp yard, the setts should be every ¼ inch (.63 cm).

Use any yarn you would like to create a header.,
Insert a knitting needle to pick up the warp yarn.,
Follow the path of the needle by weaving over and under with the header until you reach the other side of the box.,
Insert the tines of a fork in the warp and draw the fork toward the bottom of the box, forcing the header against the bottom edge of the box.
,
Remove the knitting needle and reinsert it in the warp when you weave with hemp, but this time insert the needle on the left and go under the first strand, over the second, under the third and so on until you reach the other side of the box.
,
Rest the point of the knitting needle on the edge of the box.,
Feed the hemp yarn, starting on the right, through the lifted spaces by the knitting needle.
,
Allow the hemp to arch a little in a curve rather than straight across the warp.,
Beat the yard by inserting the tines of the fork and pushing the yard down against the previous row.
,
Continue the process by threading the yarn from the left to right and back again, being careful to alternate going under and over at the start of each row.
,Cut the excess yarn when you finish weaving, and tie knots in the top and bottom of the warp to keep your woven fabric from unraveling.",How to Weave Hemp2," The header is the first strand against which the rest of your hemp yarn will be “beat” or pressed against when you weave hemp.
, Put the point of the needle over the first strand on the left, under the second strand, over the third and so on until the point of the knitting needle overhangs the right of the box while the other end of the knitting needle overhangs the left of the box.
, Let the yard hang down over the side.

Cut the top flaps off of a cardboard box.You can do this with a pair of sharp scissors or with a box cutter.,
Draw a short line of hot glue along the bottom edge of the box.,
Quickly press the end of some jute cord into the glue.,
Continue gluing and wrapping the cord around the box until you reach the top of the box.Squeeze out another 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of hot glue, and press the cord against it.,
Trim the excess rope off.,
Measure the inside of your box to get the dimensions for a lining.,
Draw your pattern on the wrong side of a large piece of fabric.,
Cut your pattern out.,
Pin and sew the ""walls"" of the lining together.,
Fold the top hem down by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters), and topstitch it.,
Insert the lining, and secure it with more hot glue.",How to Turn a Cardboard Box Into a Basket1," If your box is not very stable, now is the time to reinforce it with duct tape or packaging tape.

Your box can be any size, but be aware that the bigger it is, the more glue and rope you will need.;
, Plug in your hot glue gun, insert a hot glue stick, and let the gun heat up. Once it's hot, draw a 1 to 2-inch (2.54 to 5.08-centimeter) line of hot glue along the bottom edge of the box, close to one of the corners., You can use any thickness of cord you'd like. Thinner cord would work better for smaller boxes, while thicker cord will work for larger ones., Keep going around the box in rows until you reach the top of the box. Make sure that there aren't any gaps between the rows.

If you don't have a lot of glue, you can glue the cord down every few inches.Avoid squeezing out too much hot glue at one time; hot glue sets fast.

, If you need to, secure the end with more hot glue. Your basket at this point is essentially complete, or you can read on to learn how to make a lining and give it a nicer finish., Use a ruler or measuring tape to measure the length and width of the bottom of the box. If the sides are different sizes, be sure to take their measurements too., Draw the base of the box in the middle of the fabric, and the walls to each side of the base. You will end up with something that looks like a giant + sign.

You can use any type of fabric you want. Because of how rustic jute cord is, cotton, linen, or canvas would work best.

, Leave behind a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam on every edge. If you don't, your lining will be too small., Fold each of the walls together, so that their edges meet, and pin them in place. You should have something that looks like a box. When you're done pinning, sew the four corners using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Remove the pins when you are done and don't turn the lining inside out., Fold the hem down all the way around the top edge of the lining, and pin it in place. Make sure that you are folding towards the wrong side of the lining, where the seams are. Topstitch close to the raw edge, then remove the pins., Set the lining into the basket. If the fabric is flimsy, like cotton, clip the hem to the edge of the basket with clothespins or binder clips. Hot glue the hem, inch by inch (2.54 centimeters) to the top edge of the box, removing the clothespins/binder clips as you do so."

Trace the base of a box onto a sheet of fabric or felt, then cut the fabric out.,
Cut the top flaps off of the box, then cut the box apart at the corners.,
Glue your fabric/felt to the base of the box.,
Cut ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) thick slits into each flap.,
Punch a hole into the each finger, close to the upper, narrow edge.Try to center each hole as much as possible.,
Hot glue the end of some jute cord to the base of one finger.,
Begin weaving the cord over and under each finger.,
Continue weaving until you are partway up the holes you punched.Every so often, use your fingers to push down on the rows.,
Begin weaving over the top edge of the basket.,
Skip a hole, and feed the rope through the next one.,
Finish the top of the box.,
Cut and knot the cord when you are done.",How to Turn a Cardboard Box Into a Basket2," This will make the inner lining of your basket. For a neater finish, cut two pieces of fabric or felt. Set these aside when you are done.You can use any size of box you want. Keep in mind that, the bigger your box is, the more rope you will need to use.

, You can use a pair of sharp scissors or a box cutter to do this. Cut the flaps off first, then cut straight down each of the four corners. Flatten the box, so that you end up with something that looks like a +., Coat the base of the box using tacky glue and a stiff paintbrush, then place the material on top. Smooth out any wrinkles. If you cut two pieces of material, be sure to glue the other one to the underside of the box as well., Cut the slits from the edge of the flap all the way to the crease. Make sure that the slits are evenly spaced apart—including the side edges of each flap. About 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) apart should work for most size boxes. These will make the ""fingers"" of your basket.Be sure to cut slightly into the fabric/felt lining as well. This will allow you to ""catch"" the lining as you weave and prevent raw edges.The slits need to be about ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) wide to accommodate the string you will be weaving around the ""fingers.""
If you are using a very big box, you may have to use thicker cord so that it will be more proportionate. Make your slits about ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) wide to accommodate the thickness of the cord.

, You will be weaving the cord through these holes at the end, so make them as close to the edge of each finger as possible—about ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) will be enough.

Depending on the thickness of your box, you may be able to use a regular hole puncher. If your box is too thick, you can punch the holes with a nail instead.

, Choose a ""finger"" at the edge of one of the flaps. Draw a 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) line of hot glue across the finger, right next to the crease. Quickly press the end of your cord against the glue.

The thinner the cord is, the better.

, When you reach the opposite end of the flap, fold the flap and the one next to it together to make a corner, and continue weaving. When you are done with your first row, the walls should be standing in their original positions.Be sure to weave tightly at the corners.
Be sure to weave over the fabric/felt. This will pin the material to the ""fingers"" and wide the raw edges.

, This keeps your weave nice and right, and prevents gaps. Make sure that the gaps left inside the holes are still big enough for the cord to fit through.

If you run out of cord, tie the end of a new cord to it, and continue weaving. Tuck the tail ends of the knot under the cord as you weave.

, Weave the cord under a finger, then pull it up through the finger's hole. Pull the cord up, then feed it through the hole again.Keep your weaving on this part loose.

, Pull the cord past the adjacent hole, bring it behind the finger, and push it out through the hole. Keep weaving the cord through every other hole until you are back where you started., When you get back to where you started, every other finger should have an empty hole. Continue weaving your cord over the fingers, and through the empty holes. You may have to make several rounds like this, until the holes are filled, and tops of the fingers are covered., Once the top of the basket is to your liking, cut the cord, leaving a tail that is a few inches/centimeters long. Tie the tail to one of the cords on the inside of the basket, and trim it off. If you are worried about it unraveling, secure it with a drop of glue."

Identify where this outdoor “basket” will be helpful.,
Choose a color according to your reason and use of your basket.",How to Make a Basket from a Garden Hose1," Is there an area in the backyard where the gardening tools get thrown in the corner or do you need a handy holder for swim items like goggles, flippers, and/or pool toys? Figure out how you will integrate the basket into your outdoor décor, as this will likely effect the color and style of the basket you create.;
, While you could just create the basket from an old garden hose you have laying around, it's probably best to spring for a new hose in a color that matches your outdoor décor. If you hit the lawn and garden store such as Bunnings or Masters ect, you will most likely have several colors to accommodate your needs––they may even have some fancy patterns!


Consider matching the zip tie color to the hose color or purchase zip ties in a complementary, contrasting color.

Cut off any excess ends of cane.,
Singe the work.,
Wash the piece with warm water.,
Ensure that the basketry work is fully dry before placing into storage.",How to Finish off Basketry Work," This part requires good balancing to ensure that they are not cut off too short or left too long.


Use a sharp knife, clippers, or hand shears to perform this.;
, Finished basketry work should be carefully singed to remove the thin fibers that tend to stick out after working with the cane. Do this using the tip of a Bunsen burner or small craft flame.


Avoid using a wax taper such as a candle, as this will blacken the cane-work.

, This will remove any dirt and improves the look of the basket. Do not use soap.

, If it isn't, it will discolor and it may attract mold or mildew growth.

Bend the blunt hose nozzle in half.,
Wind the hose around the initial circle twice.,
Continue to wind the hose around itself to create the basket base.,
Wind the hose until you are satisfied with the size of the basket's flat base.,
Wind the hose around the top of the outer base circle.,
Add twist ties in fours for every loop you create.",How to Make a Basket from a Garden Hose2," Then bend it underneath itself. This will be the basis for winding the basket, so secure the nozzle snugly.

, Then add twist ties around the perimeter of the initial base to hold everything in place; wind tightly.


Don’t let go of the hose as you secure the wound-up hose reel in place; keep the rest of the hose in the other hand.
Use approximately four twist ties per circular round. Space the ties evenly around the perimeter for the firmest hold.







, Add twist ties around the perimeter of each circle and tie on tightly.

, The base size will depend on personal preference and need; obviously larger baskets require more hose but can also hold a lot more.

, This will begin to build the side of the basket.

, Ensure that the twist ties are aligned and staggered. Continue up the sides of the basket until you consider it to be high enough for your needs.

Finished.",How to Make a Basket from a Garden Hose3," Depending on how large or high you made the basket, allow for approximately one foot (30.5cm) of hose to remain to create the handle with.

, Start where you want the handle to begin and twist the hose around so it is facing the exact other side of the basket.

, The loop should resemble a basket handle. Secure the bottom portion of the hose along the other side of the basket top.

, Consider placing a twist tie toward the end of the hose to avoid having the hose's mouth snag on items.

, Carry it out to its new spot in the garden and place items, plants or whatever else inside it.

Prepare a large, clear area for organizing your projects.,
Take out all your incomplete knitting and crochet projects and place them in your sorting area.,
Take out your entire yarn collection and place each skein or ball of yarn in your sorting area.,
Go through each of your projects, and decide whether to keep or scrap them.,
Scrap all of the projects that you do not want to complete.,
Divide the remaining skeins of yarn into groups based on projects.,
Put each project in a separate storage place.,
Organize any ""uncommitted"" yarn.,
Decide what you need to finish the remaining projects.,
Make a plan to finish the current projects.",How to Organize Your Knitting and Crochet Projects," This will be your sorting area. Make sure it is clean and dry. The more projects that you have, the more room you will need. Good examples of places include a made bed, a clean dinner table, or a clean couch. A good rule of them is this: don't use any surface that you don't want your yarn touching.;
, Go through all your bags, closets, and boxes for all those incomplete knitting and crochet projects. Search every corner in your house for your projects; you'll want to see every project in the same place for the following steps.

, Again, go through all your drawers, baskets, and any other place that holds yarn. It is important for you to visualize what you have. If you find any yarn that is not in a ball, hank, or skein, this is the time to ball up your yarn.


Line up all your yarn and take a photo while you have it out. If you can, store it in clear bins. That way, you will know what you have without getting it all out, and you will be able to find yarn later without too much digging.

, There are some projects that you will want to keep and other projects that you will want to get rid of. The decision of whether to get rid of a project or not is up to you.


If you are not sure whether or not you want to keep the project, keep it for now; you can always get rid of it later.
Date-specific projects whose date has passed should definitely be rid of. For example, an incomplete newborn-sized baby hat for a friend's two-year-old son should be gotten rid of if you cannot give it to another newborn baby; the same son won't be a newborn again. ""Millennium"" projects slated to be done in the year 2000 or 2001 should be scrapped, since the new millennium has already started.
If you haven't shown any interest in the project for a year, it's time to let the project go. The yarn can be used to make a new project.

, Just remove any needles or hooks, grab on one of the loose ends, and pull. Ball up the yarn; most of it can be reused for something else.

, Go through your whole pile of yarn and ""assign"" each skein, ball, or hank of yarn to a project. Choose yarn from your stash that will fit the each project's needs. Always assign a few extra skeins of yarn to each project just in case you need that extra yarn. Be sure to check the dye lot numbers of all the skeins.


If a project needs more yarn than you have, put the project and its yarn to the side; you can deal with it later.

, Use whatever storage method works for you, but make sure that yarn from different projects don't mix together; this will make it easier to find what you need for your projects. For example, if you use shelves to organize your yarn, put yarn for one project in each cubby in the shelf. If you do not have shelves or any storage container that can easily be divided into small parts, put the yarn for each project into separate gallon-sized resealable storage bags, and label the bags with the project name.

, All of the yarn left in your storage space should be yarn that hasn't been assigned to any project. There are many ways to organize your yarn; pick the one that fits you the best. If you want to start a new project in the future, look to this pile first for your yarn needs; you might be able to make the project without buying new yarn.

, Turn your attention back to your projects. Check the pattern for each project to see what supplies you need. Do you have all the needles, hooks, yarns, et cetera needed to make the project? Write down everything you need that you don't have so that you will remember to pick up these items the next time you go to the craft store. Remember that you may need to use a different size hook or needle to get the gauge, so be prepared to have different sizes of needles and hooks.

, No matter how tempting, try to finish the projects that you do have before starting other projects. A good rule of thumb is this: finish half of your current projects before starting any new projects.

, Fold both strips in half, lengthwise, with the right sides facing in. Sew along the long edge and one of the short ones using a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) seam allowance. Do this for both strips of fabric., Clip the corners between both of the sewn edges first. Next, turn the tube inside out. You can do this by scrunching it up into a disk, placing the sewn end over a dowel, and then rolling it back down--sort of like putting on a pair of tights., Use a dowel to push the stuffing into each tube.Try to get the stuffing as even as possible, or your tube will end up lumpy. When you are done, tie a rubber band around the open ends.

If your tubes are too lumpy, roll them across a table with your palms from end to end.
You will eventually remove the rubber bands. They are there simply to keep the stuffing in place while you work.

, Set both tubes down side-by-side, vertically. Loop both ends towards the left to form a ""4"" shape at the bottom. The tubes sticking out on the right side should be much longer than the ones sticking out at the bottom.You will treat both tubes as a single tube.
Keep the tubes flat and side-by-side.

, Pull the tubes back up. Bring them over the top of first loop, then pull them back down. They should be to the left of first, vertical strands.

Pull the bottom (short) ends over the top (long) ends., Bring both of the long ends up. Point them to the left, towards the loops. Weave them through the loops: over and under, over and under, until they come out on the other side., Pull the ends downward, and give them a gently tug. This should tighten the knot. If you need to, give the other two ends (the shorter ones) a tug as well. This ends the semi-Turk's Head knot.The real Turk's Head knot is a bit more complex. This is a simplified one.

, Remove the rubber bands first, then fold the ends of the tubes until they touch each other. Tuck the sewn other tube into the open outer tube. Repeat with the inner tubes., Fold the cut edges of the open tubes in by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) first. Sew around the seam with a needle and a matching thread color. You can also secure the seams using fabric glue or hot glue instead.

If you are using fabric glue, use safety pins to hold the tubes together until the glue dries. This should only take about 15 minutes or so.

, Separate the six strings of yarn into sections of two. Braid these together until you match the length of the fringe in the beginning of the strings. Tie a knot to match the same fringe length as the knot in the top., Starting in the middle of the top of the poncho, pull the braided string gently through each ch2 that's between the tr stitches.

Pinching with two fingers, pick up the yarn roughly 6-8"" from the end.,
Twist your fingers clockwise to make the yarn cross over, forming a loop.,
Put your two fingers inside the loop, expanding it out.,
Using the fingers in the loop, grab the standing yarn and pull it partially through.,
Pull the tail of the yarn to tighten the knot about halfway.,
Slide your knitting needle or crochet hook into the loop and pull both ends of yarn tight.",How to Make a Slip Knot1," It should drop down into a U-shape as it falls under your fingers. You don't need to measure the yarn precisely; just give yourself enough extra yarn to work with.This U-shape is called a ""bight"" in knot tying.;
, All it requires is a half turn or so, and the yarn should naturally cross over itself.








, Make sure your other hand is holding onto the strands of yarn below your loop, keeping the shape intact.








, The standing yarn is the line that leads back to your ball of yarn. The shorter side, leading to the end, is called the tail. Pulling the standing line through will form another bight (U-shaped bend in the yarn).









You only need to pull a few inches of yarn through.

, You don't want to cinch the whole thing down yet. You can, however, pull on the tail to bring the knot closer together and ""clean it up.""









It should look a bit like a noose, with a knot on the bottom of a yarn loop.

, A slip knot almost always goes around something, as the beauty of the know is how easily it tightens and loosens around an object. Pull both the tail and standing line simultaneously to tighten your slip knot.







"
"
Pick up the yarn approximately 12 centimeter (4.7 in) (5in) from the end.,
Create a loop by taking the long end of the yarn (standing line) and winding it over the top of the shorter end (tail).,
Using your right hand, pick up the standing line of yarn to form another bight.,
Feed this second bite through the back of the loop.,
Pull on the tail of the knot to tighten the first loop around the second.,
Feed your knitting needles or crochet hook into the remaining loop and pull the long end of the yarn to close the loop over the needle.",How to Make a Slip Knot2," This will create a U-shaped ""bight"" in the yarn.

, Hold the point where the yarns cross tightly between your left thumb and forefinger.








, Remember, the standing line is the part leading back to your yarn ball. Form another half-loop here, like you did in step one of this method.








, This will create a loop in a loop.








, This will make the knot much cleaner and easier to manage.








, This is all you need for your slipknot.

Pull out about ten inches of yarn from your yarn ball.,
Make a 1"" loop in the yarn by tucking the end of the yarn under the rest of the yarn.,
Flip the loop back down so it lays on top of the rest of the yarn.,
Pick up the yarn inside the loop and pull it through.,
Pull the end of the yarn to get the knot tight, keeping the loop at the top open.,
Slip the knot onto a knitting needle or crochet hook and pull both ends to tighten the knot.",How to Make a Slip Knot3," The exact amount doesn't matter -- you just need enough to work with comfortably.

, Simply double the yarn back on itself, then slide the end underneath the rest of the yarn to make a circle.








, Make sure you flip it towards the side with the rest of the yarn, not the side with the end of the yarn.








, Simply pinch the straight line of yarn underneath your loop and pull it through 1-2"". It should naturally form another loop.








, You only want to tighten it enough to close the first loop you made, leaving the other loop open on top. It looks a bit like a noose.








, Put the knitting needle in through the remaining loop and pull both ends of yarn to make it snug.

Start by choosing something to wind your yarn around.,
Starting with your yarn at the top, begin winding the yarn around the book.,
Cut the yarn away from the skein.

,
Cut the yarn at the top of the book/item.

,
Now you have several pieces of yarn, all the same length.

,
Decide how many pieces of yarn you want to use together.,Fold your pieces evenly.,
Always begin with the right side of your project facing up.,
Insert your crochet hook into the first loop from the bottom up.

,
Take the two pieces of yarn folded in half, hook them with the crochet hook and pull them through the loop.

,
Take the ends of the two pieces of yarn and push them through the loop made by folding the two pieces in half.,
Pull on the free ends to draw them down snugly, but not too tightly.,
Continue in this way until you've added as much fringe to your project as you like.",How to Add Fringe to a Crochet or Knit Project," You can use a small book, a CD or DVD jewel case, a stiff piece of cardboard or an old address book. It should be something that is approximately 5x7"", depending on the length you want the fringe.;
, Wind it several times, but not so many times that you won't be able to cut through all of it with a pair of scissors. End with the yarn at the top of the book.


Wind loosely enough that you can get scissors underneath it to cut.

,,,,


Two pieces together are being used in this example and for this scarf.

,, The way to tell if it is the right side is to go back to your foundation chain, and position your piece so the beginning tail of yarn is on your left side. This makes the right side up.

,,, You can also hook the free ends with the crochet hook and pull them through the loop you just made.

, Pull on both ends evenly.

, Trim the ends to even them up, if you want to.

"
"
Start with a spool of craft wire or straighten a paper clip or two.,
Grip the very end of the wire in the pliers.,
Grip the wire just past the loop you just formed and fold it over the other way.

,
Grip the wire and turn it one more time.,Curl the wire out a little at the loose end.,
Cut the wire off where you want it, generally a bit past the bottom of the second loop.,
Curl the wire back toward itself.",How to Make Wire Stitch Markers," Any small paper clip will do, whether or not it is plastic coated, as long as it it is made of wire. Craft wire, if you have it, is a little softer and easier to work.

, Loop the end of the wire closely around the tip of the pliers.

,, This time, grip it higher up and turn it a little more loosely.

,, Many pliers have a wire cutting edge like these do.

, This will help when inserting the marker and it will help keep the marker from catching things.

Sort your tubs by yarn type.,
Sort by project.,
Place all the stray balls and skeins together.

,
Follow the new system.,
Gather up your pattern books.,
Organize the knitting needles.,
Arrange the knitting tools.,
Keep track of your pile of works-in-progress.",How to Organize Your Knitting Supplies," A good sorting process will be to place your alpaca, wool, cotton, novelty, etc. yarn types so that you can easily find the right yarn type for the right project. Keep wool, cashmere and alpaca together. Store with cedar balls, cedar and lavender essential oils (not moth balls, they are highly toxic). You don't want moths eating your yarn!;
, This is another alternate method. For instance, you can sort by sweaters, scarf or knitted toy, with each set of skeins bagged together before being put in the tub, etc. If you've got the pattern handy, you can put the pattern into the bag with the yarn for that project before putting it in the tote, so you don't forget what you were going to knit with that yarn.

,, Once your totes are ready, it will be simple to add new yarn in an organized fashion, including the leftovers out of the works-in-progress basket, the treasured skein off your dresser, the yarn still in its mailer under the bed, the yarn store bags out of your car etc. Put all these yarns in their matching tote. If you have a small stash, or are just really ambitious, you can use Excel to make a spreadsheet of all the yarn you have in store for new projects.

, Put all your loose paper patterns into a clamp-ring notebook, a magazine box or folder. Choose an order that suits you best - by project, what to knit next, by weight, etc. Shuffle other books around on your bookshelf so that all your knitting books can be shelved together. Put your books together on the bookshelf, in a suitable order.Store your notebook(s) of patterns here with your books.

, Try making a knitting needle roll up. Or, get strong, plastic freezer bags - choose those that are made of thicker plastic and are thus harder to poke holes in. Put all the needles of one size in one bag. Label the bag with a permanent marker. If you have a great many of one size of needle, make two bags - one for circular and one for DPNs. Put all the bags in numerical order (2,3,4, etc.), then use a strong hole puncher to punch through all the bags below the ""zipper."" Tie a piece of strong yarn through the holes or insert the bags into a notebook (make enough holes for this). The greatest part about this is when you're knitting a project that will utilize several of one size, you will have everything together. A hat, for example, may use circular and DPNs needles. Just take the whole bag with you, and you've got all you need. Put straights into a pretty vase, but to prevent the ""where's the second no. 4?!"" syndrome, place a rubber band around the tip of pairs to keep them together. Face this end down in the bottom of the vase, so it doesn't show. This will keep the needles all together.

, The tools will include the many tape measures, point protectors, stitch markers, and other ""stuff."" Store them in a commonsense manner. Collect small, zippered accessory bags or strong freezer bags. In each bag, place scissors, a tape measure, some stitch markers and other items as appropriate. Put each bag in a place where you like to knit. For example, you might leave one in your car, one in your nightstand, and one in the table next to the couch. You will never have to hunt and will always have tools at hand. This is easier than simply dumping them all into one bag, this means less to sort through in each individual bag.

, If you only have four or five, you can keep them in a smaller plastic bin. Your favorite current project might go in a bowl in your nightstand, and it's ready to be knitted, with needles, tools, etc., all placed together and waiting. Enjoy your newly organized knitting!

Wear the bolero.",How to Crochet a Bolero," Determine how much of your arm you wish to cover, then measure the full span using a measuring tape.

This pattern is easy to customize, and you can use it to create a bolero with cap sleeves, short sleeves, or long sleeves.
Hold your arms out straight, then measure along your back from one desired stopping to the other, crossing over your shoulder blades in the process.
You may need someone else to measure the appropriate span. Alternatively, you can approximately measure the desired span by extending the measuring tape over the sleeves and back of a well-fitting shirt.

, Locate the widest part of your upper arm and loosely wrap the measuring tape all the way around it.

You'll need to crochet the height of the bolero so that it is at least as long as your arm circumference.

, Determine where you want the bolero to stop. Extend a tape measure from your desired stopping point to the base of your neck to determine your desired bolero height.

To be a true bolero, the height must be somewhere between your bust and natural waist.
Note that this measurement must be equal to or longer than your arm circumference. It shouldn't be more than double that circumference, however, since the sleeves might become too baggy.

, Tie the yarn onto your crochet hook using a standard slip knot.

You can create this bolero using any yarn weight and any size crochet hook. The crochet hook should be chosen based on the manufacturer's recommendations for the type/weight of yarn you use.;
, For an adult medium bolero with short sleeves, you'll need to work approximately 192 chain stitches.Alter the number of chain stitches to roughly match the length measurement you took previously. Make sure that your stitch count equals a multiple of five, plus an additional two (e.g. 127 chains, 172 chains, 212 chains, etc.). When finished, your chain should be long enough to extend across your back and over your desired arm length on either side.

, Turn the work over and single crochet once into the second chain from the hook. After that, single crochet once into each stitch until you reach the end of the foundation chain., Turn the piece, the work one no-turning-chain double crochet into the first stitch of the previous row. Double crochet twice into the same stitch as the no-turning-chain double crochet.

Work a double crochet pattern across the row:

Skip four stitches.
Work two double crochets into the next stitch.
Chain one.
Work two double crochets into the same stitch as the previous set.


Repeat your double crochet pattern until you reach the last five single crochets of the previous row, then skip over four of those stitches. Work three double crochets into the final stitch of the row.

, Turn the piece and work one no-turning-chain double crochet into the first stitch of the previous row. Work two more double crochets into the same stitch before progressing into the row pattern.

To complete the pattern for this row:

Skip over all the double crochets of the previous row.
Work two double crochets, one chain stitch, and two additional double crochets into each chain-one space of the previous row.


Continue this row pattern until you reach the last double crochet cluster. Work three double crochet stitches into the final double crochet of that cluster.

, As with your previous two rows, turn the piece and work one no-turning-chain double crochet into the first stitch. Follow this with two double crochets into the same stitch.

Work your row pattern as follows:

Chain two.
Single crochet once into the space above and between your row-two double crochets. Note that these stitches should still be worked into your previous row (row three).
Work two double crochets, one chain, and two additional double crochets into the next chain space.
Chain two.
Single crochet once into the space above and between the next row-two double crochet clusters.


Repeat this pattern until you reach the final cluster of double crochets, then double crochet three times into the final double crochet of the previous row.

, Continue working rows two, three, and four in the same sequence until the resulting rectangle matches your previously measured desired height.

For an adult medium or large bolero, you'll likely end up with roughly 70 to 73 rows. This amount can vary depending on your needs and preferences, but keep the final row count as a multiple of three plus one (e.g. 55 rows, 61 rows, 80 rows, etc.). When finished, the height of the rectangle should be able to join loosely around your upper arm.Do not fasten off the yarn at the end of the final row unless you do not plan to add any ribbing to the bolero.

, Chain one, then work one double crochet into each stitch across the final row of your main body piece.

Your stitch count should remain even with the stitch count of the final body row. Do not decrease or increase the row length while working any portion of the ribbing.

, Chain two at the end of the row, then turn the piece over. Front post double crochet once into the next stitch, then double crochet once into the stitch after that; repeat across the row.

A front post double crochet is essentially the same as a standard double crochet, but instead of inserting the hook through the indicated stitch and to the back of the work, you'll only insert it through the front of the stitch. The hook will remain at the front of the work and will not poke through to the other side., Chain two and turn the piece over. Double crochet once into the next stitch, then back post double crochet into the stitch after that; repeat across the row.

The back post double crochet is essentially the same as a standard double crochet, but instead of inserting the hook through the indicated stitch from front to back, you'll insert it through the back of the work and across the indicated stitch, keeping the hook at the back of the work the entire time., Chain one, but do not turn the piece. Front post single crochet into the next stitch, then single crochet into the stitch after that; repeat across the rest of the row.

The front post single crochet is the same as a standard single crochet stitch, but instead of inserting the hook through the indicated stitch from front to back, you'll insert it through the front of the stitch, keeping it only at the front of the work instead of extending it through to the back.

, At the end of the fourth row, cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the final loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Do not trim the remaining tail end. Instead, you'll weave this end into the piece toward the end of the project.

, Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using another slip knot, then slip stitch into the first stitch of your first body row to join the new yarn to that row., Work an identical four rows of ribbing along the top edge of the rectangle, then fasten off the yarn.For the first row, chain one, then double crochet across.
For the second row, chain two and turn. Front post double crochet once into the next stitch, then double crochet once into the stitch after that; repeat across.
For the third row, chain two and turn. Double crochet once into the next stitch, then back post double crochet into the stitch after that; repeat across.
For the fourth and final row, chain one. Front post single crochet into the next stitch, then single crochet into the stitch after that; repeat across the row.
Fasten off the yarn at the end of the fourth row, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail.

, Fold the entire rectangle in half so that the ribbed edges meet.

Position the bolero so that the joined edges meet along the horizontal bottom of the piece. You'll be joining these horizontal edges only; do not join the vertical edges together.

, Attach free yarn to your crochet hook, then slip stitch the across a portion of the horizontal joined ends at the left of the piece.

The exact amount of slip stitches you make will depend upon the sleeve length you wish to have. For cap style sleeves, you may only need to slip stitch across the first three or four sets. Short sleeves might be double that amount, and long sleeves will require four times that amount or more.
You can check on the amount by measuring the distance from your shoulder down to your desired end point on your arm. Create a sleeve that matches that distance.

, Attach free yarn to your crochet hook, then slip stitch across an equal portion of the horizontal joined ends at the right of the piece.

Make sure that your second sleeve matches the size and stitch count of the first sleeve.
If done properly, there will still be enough joined space between the two sleeves to cover the width of your upper back.

, Use a tapestry needle to weave all loose tail ends into the underside of the adjacent stitching. Doing so hides the ends while making them more secure., Open up the unjoined edges and try on your new bolero. The joined portion of the sleeves should fall over the inside of your arms, and the body of the shrug (the open space between the two sleeves) should span across your upper back."

Cast on 15 to 20 stitches.,
Measure around the body just below the armpits, over any garments you will be wearing under the sweater.,

Put these stitches aside.,
You now have a body and 2 sleeves.,
Knit across the front, across one sleeve, across the back, across the other sleeve and you should be back where you started at the front again--all the stitches should be on one set of knitting needles.,
Before you get any further, measure from below the arms (where you have knitted to so far) to the top of the shoulder.,
Divide the number of stitches that you will need to decrease by 4, since you will decrease four times per row, once at each stitch marker.,
Continue knitting, making sure to decrease at the markers.,
Keep trying it on, stopping when it fits right rather than when you may have planned to stop.

",How to Knit a Raglan Sleeve Sweater," Using the needles you are going to knit with, knit a square. The circular needles will cause you to automatically make a stocking stitch, so that is the stitch you will use to make this little sample square, or swatch. It might be a good idea to block the square before you measure it. Measure how many stitches per inch and how many rows per inch. This will be your guide when you want to know how many stitches to cast on initially. An example of this, which is called gauge, would be ""5 stitches and 4 rows for one inch"".;
, Multiply this by your stitches-per-inch. For example, if we use the ""5 stitches and 4 rows for one inch"" and your measurement under the armpits is, say, 37 inches (94.0 cm), you would multiply 37 by 5 and get 185 stitches. Write this number down too. It is your Key Number.

, If you like, you can do a couple of rows of rib stitching first. But if you don't, the edge of the sweater will roll just a little, creating a neat, casual effect.

, That is, leave them on the first set of circular needles and leave them, making sure they won't fall off.


Measure around your wrist and, multiplying the number of inches by the number of stitches-per-inch, cast on those stitches on the second set of circular needles.
Before you actually start to work, measure the upper part of your arm and increase the stitches as you work the sleeves so that when you are done with the sleeve, it will fit over your arm to the point where you will join the body with the sleeve.
An alternate way to do this is to just measure the widest part of your arm and, using that measurement, find the initial stitches you will need. This will create kind of a wide, casual, comfortable sleeve that will look nice.
Work the sleeve until you have the length you want and keep trying it on, to make sure it will fit.
In order to make the second sleeve, you may want to get a thick piece of yarn and run it through all of the stitches on the first sleeve to hold them in place, because you don't want to bind them off.
Make 2 sleeves in this way, leaving the second sleeve on the needles.

, Cast off two inches worth of stitches at the part of the sleeves that would be considered the underarm, or the part that would connect to the body at the armpit. ( **It appears that there's a direction missing here. In order to have the 2"" space to attach the sleeve to the body of the sweater, 2"" sections at the underarm need to be caste/bound off on the body of the sweater for each sleeve. 4/5/09)

, (Your bound off stitches from sleeve will align with the bound off stitches on the body.) Tie 4 little loops of colored yarn for stitch markers around the needle at the places the sleeve and body met. These will be where you decrease.

, Multiply this measurement by the number of rows to the inch. This will tell you how much further you must knit. You will need to have enough stitches to go round your neck when you get there. You need to measure your neck and multiply that by your stitches-per-inch. That is how many stitches you will need in order to be sure that the sweater neck will fit. Count how many stitches you already have on the needles and subtract the amount of stitches you will need at the end--the number of stitches you just found by measuring your neck. The remaining number after this subtraction is the number of stitches you will need to decrease by the time you get to the neck.

, This will give you the number of rows you need to go before you reach the desired number of stitches.

, You don't have to be too exact with the neck. Just keep trying it on and decrease until it is comfortable. If you want a 'turtle' neck, or 'mock' neck, continue knitting after you are done decreasing until the neck is as tall as you want it.

,, If you don't, the neck will just roll a little, as said before, witch creates a casual look. Use smaller needles if you want it to close in a little. Cast off.

Round 12 gets 12 increases.
Round 13 gets 13 increases.


Note that if the rug begins to seem too loose or floppy, you can reduce the number of increases you use at the ends of each round.
To change the color, cut the yarn you are currently working with, leaving a tail 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Slip this end through the back of the next stitch, turn the rug around halfway, and begin single stitching your next round with the new color. Tie the next color onto the crochet hook using a slipknot.

When you reach the tail from your previous color after working your way around, weave it into the new color as you make your next stitches.



, Change colors a third time after finishing round 13. Afterward, make another five rounds by single crocheting into each stitch of the previous rounds, including the increases.


Continue adding increases at the ends of each round.

Round 14 gets 14 increases.
Round 15 gets 15 increases.
Round 16 gets 16 increases.
Round 17 gets 17 increases.
Round 18 gets 18 increases.


Note that if the rug begins to seem too loose or floppy, you can reduce the number of increases you use at the ends of each round.

, Switch your yarn color one final time. Make another six rounds using the same method of single crocheting once into each stitch of the previous rounds.


Continue adding increases at the ends of each round.

Round 19 gets 19 increases.
Round 20 gets 20 increases.
Round 21 gets 21 increases.
Round 22 gets 22 increases.
Round 23 gets 23 increases.
Round 24 gets 24 increases.


Note that if the rug begins to seem too loose or floppy, you can reduce the number of increases you use at the ends of each round.

, Even out the edge by making a slip stitch into each stitch of the final round.

, Cut the yarn so that a 3 inch (7.6 cm) tail hangs off the edge of the rug. With a loop still on your hook, grab this tail and pull it through the loop, tightening the loop over it. This will create a knot and tie off your project.


Use a darning needle to weave the remaining end into the underside of the rug to hide it.

Using a yarn needle sew the yarn square to the foam square, weaving in and out of the holes.,
Stuff your pillow.,Sew your pillow up for good.,
Add tassles.",How to Knit a Pillow (for Beginners)," Four of them should be a solid color and the last one should be ""variegated yarn"". ""Variegated yarn"" is simply yarn that is different colors. Choose colors that coordinate with one another.
, Each square is approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) in length and width. Knit one square for each of the solid colors. Also knit an extra square with any solid yarn, and four squares with the variegated yarn.


Cast on 12 stitches.

Knit 12 rows.

Cast off Yarn from a Knitting Needle


, Place the variegated squares in the corners. In the middle of the square, put one of the solid colors that you knit twice., This step is optional and can only be done if you're using wool yarn. Felting makes your knitting softer and harder to differentiate the stitches. To felt, simply throw your work in the washer and put in a pair of jeans. The more friction the better!, You can simply cut out a flower from felt. Also, it doesn't have to be a flower. It can be a felt star, circle, or whatever matches the theme of the room you'll be putting the pillow in.,, Make sure not to sew the top of your pillow, so you can fill it with stuffing., You can use anything soft you find at the crafts store.,, Do this if you have extra yarn left. Just cut out a piece of yarn and fold several pieces of yarn over it. Tie another yarn around the folded yarn. Secure tassel to your pillow."

Go with a medium worsted weight yarn.,
Consider a bulky yarn.,
Try cotton yarn for washcloths.,
Experiment with a specialty yarn.,
Opt for some metallic or plastic needles.,
Use bamboo or wood needles if you are just starting out.,
Try out circular needles.,
Choose a pattern.,
Get a pair of sharp scissors.,
Buy some stitch markers.,
Try out cabling with a cable hook.,
Grab some end protectors.,
Keep a tapestry needle on hand.,
Buy yourself a nice knitting bag.",How to Choose Knitting Supplies," Whether you are just getting started or working on your 100th sweater, medium worsted weight yarn is a safe bet.You can find this kind of yarn in almost any color and it comes in a variety of materials, such as acrylic, wool, alpaca, cashmere, and bamboo.To figure out if a yarn is medium worsted weight, check the label on the yarn. It should describe the weight with a term like medium, bulky, or super bulky.;
, If you want to finish a project faster, or you just like the bulky look, then opt for a bulky or extra bulky yarn. These yarns are popular as well, so you will have lots of different colors to choose from. Most often, bulky yarns are acrylic, but you may be able to find them in other materials if you go to a craft or specialty yarn store., Cotton yarn does not give the way that other types of yarn do, so it is not usually a good type of yarn for hats and other garments that need some stretch to them.However, cotton yarn is excellent for making washcloths and hand towels. If you feel like making a washcloth, try picking up a ball of cotton yarn., There are some really fun specialty yarns available, so try one out the next time you are feeling adventurous. You can find yarn that is made from t-shirt material, woven with metallic ribbon, or that looks fluffy like feathers or fur., Metallic and plastic needles are the cheapest and most widely available, so these are great for knitting on a budget or building up your supply of different size needles. You can even find sets of three or more pairs of metallic needles if you want to buy in bulk.

Metallic needles can make it easier to knit faster, but plastic needles are lighter in weight.Try starting with a standard size 8 needle. This is a common size for patterns that use medium worsted weight yarn.

, Bamboo and wood needles are incredibly popular among knitters.They are often easier to grip and some knitters prefer the texture of wood or bamboo to plastic or metal. If you are new to knitting, or if you have never tried using bamboo or plastic needles, give them a try.

You can get bamboo needles in all sizes.

, Circular needles are knitting needles with a length of nylon suspended between them. They are mainly use for knitting in the round, such as making sweaters or hats. However, some people also like to knit on circular needles when doing a big project like a blanket because it is easier to fit all the stitches.You can also use double ended needles for small scale knitting in the round, such as for making mittens or a hat for a baby.

, You can find tons of free knitting patterns online, or you can purchase knitting pattern books for everything from washcloths to hats to lap blankets. Browse through some patterns online or in a pattern book to find a project that you want to make.

A pattern is also a helpful guide for the supplies you will need to complete a project. Always check you pattern and get the exact type of yarn, needles, and other supplies indicated for the project.

, Sharp scissors are a must for knitting. You may only need to use them once for your project, or you may find yourself using them every 15 minutes if you have to switch your yarn out a lot. Keep a pair handy while you are working., Stitch markers are little plastic rings that go around your needles to mark the beginning of a stitch. They are especially useful for complex projects and for marking the start of your stitches when knitting in the round., Cabling intimidates many knitters when they are first starting out, but cabling is much easier than it looks. A cable hook is essential for cabling, so make sure to pick one up when you feel ready to try out this technique. They come in many different sizes., End protectors go on the ends of your knitting needles to keep the yarn from sliding off when you are working or taking a break. These are especially useful when you are knitting on double ended needles, but you can place them on the ends of any type of needle when you are ready to put it away for the day., You can buy large eye plastic tapestry needles in craft stores to help with finishing your knitting projects. These are essential for weaving in the ends of your knitting project and adding embellishments like pompoms on hats., You will need someplace nice to keep all of your supplies, so pick up a knitting bag for yourself. If you don’t want to purchase a bag, then you can also designate a canvas bag or tote as your knitting supply bag."

Move the second glass forward or backward until the print comes into sharp focus.,
Wrap the paper around one of the magnifying glasses.,
Measure along the edge of the paper from the first mark.,
Cut down the marked line on the paper to the other side.,
Cut a second slot in the tube the same distance from the first slot as was written down between the two glasses.,
Place the two magnifying glasses in their slots (big one at front, little one at back) and tape them in with the duct tape.,
Glue first length of paper around one of the magnifying glasses.,
Make the second magnifying glass tube.,
Slot the 1st tube into the 2nd.",How to Make a Telescope1," You'll need a piece of corrugated paper that is about 24 inches in length (this is a ridge material, easily available from paper stores or craft stores). You'll need two magnifying glasses that are NOT the same size. You will also need strong glue, scissors, and a pencil.If the magnifying glasses are the same size, the telescope won't work.;
, The image of the print will look blurry. Place the second magnifying glass between your eye and the first magnifying glass.

, You will notice that the print appears larger and upside down.

, Mark the diameter on the paper with the pencil. Make sure that it is pulled tight.

, You will need to measure about 1 1/2 inches from the mark. This will create the extra length to glue around the magnifying glass.

, You should be cutting across the width of it (don't cut lengthwise). The paper should be about 24 inches in length on one side. Cut a slot in the cardboard tube near the front opening about an inch (2.5 cm) away. Do not cut all the way through the tube. The slot should be able to hold the large magnifying glass.

, This is where the second magnifying glass will go.


You should now have two lengths of corrugated paper. One piece should be slightly larger than the other.

, Leave about 0.5 - 1 inch (1 - 2 cm) of tube behind the small magnifying glass and cut off any excess tube remaining.

, You'll need to glue the edges of the paper together as well, since you've left about 1 1/2 inches of paper.

, This one will need to be slightly bigger than the first one. Not too much bigger, only so that the first will fit into the second one.

, You can now use this telescope for looking at things farther away, although it will be difficult to view the stars clearly. This type of telescope is really good for viewing the moon.The images will be upside down, since astronomers don't care about up and down in space (there is no up or down in space, after all). if you wish to align the image with gravity, you can use two prisms aligned in an ""N"" shape to correct the image, but you will have to re-position the lenses.

For best results get a concave-convex lens with a diameter of 49 mm, and a focal length of 1,350 mm and a plano-concave lens with a diameter of 49 mm, and a focal length of 152 mm.
It's very easy to order lenses off the internet and they aren't very expensive. You can get the pair of lenses for about $16.
The coping saw is the most effective for making clean, straight lines, but you can use any other kind of saw or cutting device if you need to.

, You'll need both sections, but the inner tube will act to space them out. The lenses will go in either section of the outer tube.

, These will be your spacers and they should be about 1 to 1.5 inches in diameter. Make sure you cut clean and straight with the coping saw (or other tool).The spacers hold the second lens in place at the end of the outer section of the mailing tube.

, Use the drill to apply light pressure to the middle of the cap to create your eye hole. Again, this will need to be as smooth and as clean as possible to create the best viewing results.

, You'll need to make the holes where the lens is going to be placed in the outer tube, because the holes allow you to put glue into the inner part of the tube. Near the end of the inner tube is the best place, about an inch in.


You'll also need to the make holes at the end of the outer tube for the eyepiece and the cap.

, The eyepiece lens is the plano-concave lens and the flat side needs to be against the cap. You'll glue through the holes you made and turn the lens to spread the glue. Press tube against lens until the glue is dry.

, You'll end up sticking the inner tube into the outer tube through this hole.

, The spacer will need to lie flat on the inside of the outer tube to hold the concave-convex lens in place. You'll need to drill the holes and put the glue in like you did with the eyepiece.

, You'll need to make the holes, put the glue in and spread it around. Press firmly until the glue has dried.

, You can slide the pieces as necessary to get the right focus. Since this is about 9x you should be able to see the moon's surface really well and even Saturn's rings. Anything else will be too far away for your telescope.

Be comfortable.",How to Use a Telescope," Different telescopes are better for different types of viewing. There are really on three basic telescope types: refractor, reflector and catadioptric. Which one you choose will be based on what you want to observe, where you are, and so on.


The refractor basically has a long thin tube with an objective lens at the front that collects and focuses the light. This one is better for viewing the Moon and planets, usually giving a nice, crisp image. It travels well and doesn't need much maintenance. Unfortunately, it is very hard to see faint objects like galaxies and nebulae.
The reflector employs a large concave mirror rather than a lens for the purposes of accumulating and focusing light. This is one of the better beginner telescopes and it usually has pretty good visibility, although water has a tendency to condense on the optics of the telescope which can be irritating. Also, you can't view terrestrial objects with this telescope.
The catadioptric is a compound telescope, combining both lenses and mirrors. They are good photographic telescopes and they are a lot easier to carry than the reflector. This one tends to be more versatile, but they do tend to be more expensive than the other types.;
, You'll need different power levels considering where you are. If you have an area where the light pollution is better or worse. If you are in an area where it rains more, etc.


If you want to bird watch (for example) with your telescope, you'll be better off not choosing the reflector telescope because it won't show you terrestrial objects.
If you're in a place where it dews frequently and you're planning on using your telescope at night, you'll need to consider whether choosing a refractor or catadioptric telescope might be your best option.

, Objects like the planets, the Moon, and closer stars need a high power, good contrast and sharp resolution in a telescope. So if this is what you want to look at, your best bet is to go with a refractor or a reflector. If you're looking at faint objects such as galaxies and nebulae, you'll need a bigger aperture and choose a big reflector telescope.

, People generally have the mistaken impression that more power automatically means higher resolution and better viewing, but this is not actually true. High power simply dilutes the brightness of the image and amplifies any blurriness.For any telescope the maximum amount of magnification equals 50-power per inch of aperture. So say you have a 6-inch reflector. 300-power is as high as you should go (for a 3-inch reflector it would be about 150-power).
Even if you're using a Barlow lens, magnifying it too far will only result in a blurred image. The telescope's image can only be blown up to a certain point.

, This is typically attached the side of the telescope. It displays more of the sky than the scope itself. For instance, a 50 power telescope covers an area about as small as the fingernail on your little finger, whereas an 8x finderscope covers an area about the size of a golf ball., Telescopes typically come in two types: equatorial or altazimuth. You'll need to know which kind of telescope you have so you can learn how to operate your telescope.Altazimuth mount operates my going up and down and side to side, making it easier for beginners to operate. It is more simple than the equatorial telescope.
Equatorial mount swings across the celestial North to South and East to West. The polar axis (which is the rotating part closer to the telescope's base) needs to be aligned to Polaris, the North Star. It will then follow the motion of the sky around this point, moving from east to the west (as the stars move).
It takes more time to get accustomed to the equatorial mount each time you want to look at a different star or planet you have to unlock the axis and take aim at the heavenly body using the finderscope and lock it once you have the general location. From there you'll use the slow motion cable controls or panhandle controls to make the smaller movements. The equatorial mount is generally considered to be more helpful.

, You'll need to make sure that the three legs of your telescope are properly balanced otherwise the telescope can fall over and become damaged. When you're scouting out locations, always look for areas that have a flat, level area for your telescope.

, Before you start tromping around in the dark with your expensive telescope, you'll need to figure out what you're looking for. Maybe you want to have a gander at the moon, or want to check out the planets. Maybe you're interested in a meteor shower. You'll need to find out timing, place, weather, etc.


If you're trying to observe the stars, for instance, going out on a moon-lit night won't get you very far.
Look at books on stars and constellations. These will tell you when the best viewing times are and when the planets are easiest to be seen.
Examine sky charts so that when you are out in the dark you know where to point your telescope.
Train your eye. To do so, make sketches of the moon and the planets. You don't have to be a great artist to capture them as accurately as possible. This will help you to look more closely at the sky and observe details.

, You'll need to choose your spot carefully, once you've decided what you're looking for and where it will be. It will need to be accessible at night and have a place with solid level ground for your telescope's tripod.


You'll need to consider light pollution. For instance, if you're in a big city, going up on a high roof (As long as it is safe) can get you away from the worst of the light pollution and allow you to see more clearly.
Try to avoid decks and blacktop driveways and concrete. Footsteps on a deck can cause vibrations in the image. Blacktops driveways and concrete can create thermal issues for your telescope.

, You'll need to practice setting up your telescope and pointing to the correct part of the sky before you start fiddling around at night. Otherwise it is very easy to lose bits of your telescope and forget how to do something.


For practice set up your telescope and, using the lowest power eyepiece, point the main scope at something about 100 feet (30.5 m) away like a tree (not the sun!). Center the object in your crosshairs and make sure it's clear. Switch to a higher powered eyepiece and try again.

, Make sure that when you're having your big night out with the stars that you have dressed appropriately. If it is going to be cold, make sure you have the right clothes on and bring along a canister of something warm.

Close the base of the fish.,
Add a dorsal fin.,
Add two pectoral fins.",How to Crochet a Fish1," This pattern starts with a standard magic ring using six chains.


Wrap the yarn around your fingers, creating a loop. The attached end should be to the right and the tail should be to the left.
Insert the hook through the loop from front to back, then use it to pull yarn through the ring, creating a second loop.
Chain stitch six times. If you do not know how to chain stitch, please consult the ""Tips"" section of this article.
Hold the attached end of the yarn taut while gently pulling down on the tail end. The stitches should close together at the center and complete the ring.
Slip stitch into the first stitch of the magic ring to advance to your first official round. If you do not know how to slip stitch, please see the ""Tips"" section of this article.;
, Work one single crochet into each stitch of your magic ring to complete the first official round.


Check the ""Tips"" section of this article for information about single crocheting.
This round should have six stitches in it.

, Work one single crochet into the first stitch of your first round, then single crochet increase by two into the next stitch. Repeat this pattern a total of three times to complete this round.


To do a single crochet increase, simply work two single crochets into one stitch.
When done, this round should have nine stitches.

, Work one single crochet into each of the first two stitches of the previous round, then work two single crochets into the stitch after that (making a single crochet increase). Repeat a total of three times to complete the round.


When finished, this round should have 12 stitches.

, For the fourth round, work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous round.


This round should also have a total of 12 stitches.

, Work one single crochet into each of the first three stitches, then work two single crochets into the stitch after that. Repeat a total of three times to complete the round.


When finished, this round should have 15 stitches in it.

, For the sixth round, simply work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous round. Repeat this same pattern to complete rounds seven and eight, as well.


Each of these rounds will have a total of 15 stitches.

, The head of your fish is finished at this point, so you should be able to place the safety eyes accurately. The eyes should go on either side of the fish head and should be placed somewhere in between rounds three and four.


To place the eyes, slide the rod of the eye through the correct placement from the front of the work. Place your second eye in, as well, and adjust the two as needed to get them looking the way you want.
Once the eyes are placed as you'd like, push the washer onto the rod of the eye from the back of the work. Push it down as far as possible until the washer rests against the yarn. Repeat this step for the second eye, as well.Note that the eyes will no longer be movable once you put the washers on.

, Work one single crochet into each of the first three stitches, then single crochet decrease into the next two stitches after that. Perform this process a total of three times to complete the round.


Essentially, a single crochet decrease is a standard single crochet stitch worked into two stitches instead of one. To make a single crochet decrease, draw a loop up from the next stitch, then draw a second loop up from the next stitch immediately after that. Yarn over the hook, then draw that yarn-over through all three loops on your hook to complete one single crochet decrease.
This round should have 12 stitches in it when finished.

, Enough of the fish body should be finished at this point to begin the stuffing process. Add as much stuffing to the head and body as you can without interfering with the remainder of your stitch work.


From this point on, you will need to gradually add more stuffing as you go.

, For rounds 10 and 11, you will need to continue decreasing your stitches. In doing so, you will bring the body of the fish to its end.


For round 10, work two single crochets into each of the first two stitches, then work one single crochet decrease over the next two stitches after that. Perform this process a total of three times to complete a round of nine stitches.
For round 11, work one single crochet into the first stitch of the previous round. Work a single crochet decrease into the next two stitches after that, and continue decreasing for a total of four stitches. When done, this round should only have five stitches.

, For rounds 12 and 13, you will work two single crochet into each stitch of the previous round.


Work two single crochets into each stitch for the twelfth round, repeating the increase process five times and giving you a total of 10 stitches.
Work two single crochets into each stitch for the thirteenth round, repeating the increase process 10 times and giving you a total of 20 stitches.
Slip stitch the last and first stitch of the final round together before closing off the fish.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a yarn tail measuring at least 4 inches (10 cm) that you can use to close the base of the fish.


Weave the excess yarn into the center of the caudal tail using your crochet hook.
Catch five stitches in the center of the caudal tail using your crochet hook, then pull the excess yarn through all five stitches to tightly draw the hole closed.
Pull the excess yarn through the remaining loop on your hook to form a secure knot.
Weave any remaining yarn into the stitches of the tail, hiding it from sight and completing the closing process.
Make sure that you have added all the plush stuffing you need to the head, body, and tail of the fish before closing it off.

, To make the fish look more realistic, you'll need to add one dorsal fin along the top edge of the fish.


Use a tapestry needle to weave the yarn under one stitch along the top edge. This stitch should be centered in between the eyes and on the same round as the eyes.
Make a slipknot to attach the yarn to the hook. If you do not know how to make a slipknot, consult the ""Tips"" section. Keep a long tail behind this slipknot.
Insert the needle into the round directly behind your current stitch, maintaining your current alignment as best as possible. Work one single crochet into this stitch.
Work three half double crochets into the stitches behind your current one. Complete these stitches in a straight line along the top of the fish. If you do not know how to work a half double crochet, please check the ""Tips"" section of this article.
Work one slip stitch at the base of the fin to smooth it out.
Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail. Weave the excess yarn into the center of the caudal fin at the back of the fish, then draw the remaining excess through the loop on your hook to knot it off.

, You will need to make one pectoral fin on either side of the fish body. When you complete these fins, your amigurumi fish will be finished.


Use a tapestry needle to weave the yarn under one stitch lying two rounds behind the eyes and lying one stitch below the eye on one side.
slipknot the yarn onto the hook, leaving a long tail of yarn.
Work five half double crochets into one stitch.
Cut off the yarn, leaving another long tail. Weave the excess yarn tails into the center of the caudal fin on the back of the fish, then draw the excess yarn through the loop on your hook to make a knot.
Repeat on the exact opposite side of your fish to make a second pectoral fin.
This completes your project.

If you do not know how to make a slipknot, slip stitch, or chain stitch, please see the ""Tips"" section of this article for instructions.

, Work 12 double crochets into the center of your ring to complete the first official round. Join the first and last stitch together with a slip stitch before advancing to the next round.


For instructions of working a double crochet, please see the ""Tips"" section.

, Make two chain stitches. Double crochet twice into the next stitch of your previous round, then continue double crocheting twice into each stitch after that until you reach the end of your round.


Working two double crochets into one stitch can also be called a ""double crochet increase.""
Do not repeat the initial ""chain two"" at any other point in this round.

, Chain two. Double crochet once into the next stitch, then work one chain stitch, and repeat this pattern until you reach the end of this round.


Note that the initial ""chain two"" should not be repeated a second time in this round.

, Chain two. Work two double crochets (or a double crochet increase) into the next stitch, then repeat as needed until you reach the end of the round.


Do not repeat the initial ""chain two"" of this round.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot off the work, then weave any excess yarn into the back of the project.


This step completes the body of the fish. You should have a standard round dishcloth at this point.

, Choose any point along the outer perimeter of the fish body and tie on the yarn for your tail. Attach the yarn to the hook using a slipknot.


Work one single crochet into each of the next nine spaced to form a foundation for the tail.
Chain three, then turn the work before continuing.
Work one double crochet into the first space and two double crochets into the space after that. Repeat as needed until you reach the last space.
Chain three, then turn again.
For the final row, work one double crochet into the first space and two double crochets into the space after that, as you did for the previous row. Repeat until you reach the end of the row.
Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail. Pull this excess yarn through the loop on your hook to fasten off the fishtail, then weave any remaining excess into the back of your work.

, Flip your fish over so that the back side faces you. Fold the body in half with the tail centered along one side. Find the point along the opposite side of the body aligned to the center of your fishtail and count two spaces down. Tie the yarn for the lip to that space, then attach your hook with a slipknot and prepare to crochet the lips.


Working up along the side of the fish body, make a single crochet into each of the next four stitches.
Flip the fish over to the front. Chain four, then work four double crochets into one space.
In the next space, work one single crochet. If you do not know how to single crochet, check the ""Tips"" section.
Work five double crochets into the following space.
Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail. Pull the excess through the loop on your hook to knot the fish lips and weave the remainder into the back of the work.

, Fold the body of the fish to find the center top of the circle. Attach the yarn to the body and to your hook, then crochet the fin. When finished with the top fin, repeat this procedure to find the center bottom of the body and work the bottom fin.


For each fin, work five single crochets into the body, moving from right to left. Turn the work, then chain three.
Work one double crochet into the first space and two double crochets into the next space. Repeat across the row, then chain three and turn the work.
Work one double crochet into the first space and two double crochets into the space after that. Repeat across the row to finish it.
Cut the yarn and draw the excess through the loop on your hook, tying it off. Hide the remaining yarn in the back of the work.
Once you finish the top and bottom fins, your project is complete.

Locate the finder on your telescope.,

Focus the telescope on an object in the (near) distance.,
Adjust the finder to center the large object in the crosshairs.,
Look up star charts and planet guides for that month.,
Adjust the telescope to its lowest magnification.,
Locate the planet in the telescope finder.,
Find the planet through the telescope’s eyepiece.,
Sharpen the planet using the focus knobs.",How to Focus on a Planet With a Telescope," The finder is usually a smaller tube that sticks off the side of the telescope. It has a wider viewing range, so it can be used to find small objects in the sky. It only works if it is properly aligned to the telescope itself.


When you look through the finder, you should see crosshairs. After properly aligning the finder, you can center an object in these crosshairs and then look at it magnified in your telescope.;
, The lowest magnification on the telescope has the widest range of view when looking through the eyepiece. On a smaller scope, the eyepiece will have a number written in millimeters, such as 20 mm or 25 mm. The higher numbers have the lowest magnification. Look at the eyepieces on your telescope and make sure the one with the lowest magnification is in place for viewing., It is easiest to do this process during the day when you can more easily see many different objects in the distance, but it does not have to be day time. Choose a distant object such as your neighbor’s chimney or cell phone tower and find it in your telescope.If your telescope can lock in place, engage these locks to keep it from moving away from object you have found.

, Now that the telescope is focused on something, you want to move the finder until you see the exact same object centered in the crosshairs. Most finders will have screws on the side that will allow you to adjust its position. Once you have adjusted the finder, look back through it and make sure you still see the object centered in the crosshairs. Then, look through telescope and make sure it is still pointed at the object.If both views are of the object, you have successfully aligned your finder.
The finder is easily jostled out of place, so you may need to repeat this process again if the telescope is moved or bumped.

, Different planets are more or less visible depending on what time of year it is and where you are in the world. There are many websites and guides that will tell you what is visible for the month and location you are in. Use this as a guide to choose what you want to find.,These guides will give you an idea of where to look in the sky to find the planet by eye.

, Just as you did to align the finder, make sure the eyepiece with the lowest magnification is in place. Magnification on telescopes is measured in millimeters and the lowest will likely be around 20-25 mm.You want to adjust the magnification before you locate the planet in your finder because you could jostle the telescope out of position when making the change.

, Once you have found your planet of interest by eye, position the telescope so that it is pointing in that general direction. Look through the finder until you find the planet and center it in the crosshairs.


Avoid jostling the finder out of place as you try to find your object. Move the telescope to adjust the finder’s position otherwise the finder position will no longer match up with the telescope.

, If the finder has been properly aligned with the telescope, you should be able to see the planet through the telescope eyepiece. You might need to move the telescope a little bit to see the planet, but it should be pretty close to where you focused with the finder.If you get too far away and still can’t find the planet through the telescope, make sure the planet is still visible in the finder. If it is and you can’t find it in the telescope, try realigning your finder.

, Using the knobs on the side, you can shorten or lengthen the distance between the eyepiece and lens of the telescope. Changing this distance allows you to focus on the object in question. Adjust the knobs until you see the image come into a sharp focus.


Try changing the eyepiece to increase the magnification and refocus. You may find that while the image is larger, you cannot focus as well. For smaller home scopes, the more you increase the magnification, the lower your resolution of image will be. Smaller scopes just aren’t powerful enough to sharpen the focus of a highly magnified planet."

The diameter of the objective lens or mirror is the most important number describing a telescope.,
Magnification is relatively unimportant and is often hyped in advertising claims for inexpensive telescopes.,
Too much magnification just gives you a useless blur.,
The better eyepieces have larger ""eye relief,"" which represents how close you have to get your eye to the eyepiece to observer clearly.,
Look for a steady mounting, an unstable or shaky mounting will ruin your observing experience.,
Join an astronomy club and learn to use someone else's telescope before buying your own.

,
Start with a pair of binoculars and learn to find things in the sky before buying a telescope.,
Don't expect a small telescope to show the same images that you see in astronomy textbooks, which are usually long time exposures and may have been taken by much larger professional grade telescopes.",How to Choose the Right Telescope," Larger diameter lenses or mirrors allow higher resolution (ability to separate closely spaced objects) and will gather more light from faint astronomical objects. They also cost more. A good size for a first telescope is roughly four inches (100mm). Bigger tends to be considerably more expensive and more inconvenient. Bigger works better, of course, though not shockingly so.;
, In astronomy, the purpose of a telescope is mostly to collect light from faint objects, not to magnify them. Most visual observing is done between 50 and 200 power.

, A good rule of thumb to determine the maximum usable magnification is to multiply the diameter of the objective in millimeters by 2.5 (which means that the typical department store 60mm scope is only usable to 150x). In actual practice, on nights of extremely unusual atmospheric stability, you -may- be able to use a somewhat higher power, but don't count on it.

, If the eye relief is too small you will have to bring your eye very close to the eyepiece, and it will be all but impossible to observe for more than a few seconds at a time.

, In general, the more massive the mount looks, the better it performs. When in doubt, spend more on a mount.

,, (Or, if you just want to see pretty objects, get a GoTo mount.)

, No telescope practical for most individuals to own will show significant color in nebulae to the naked eye, although bigger ones will show shape well, and many can reveal color through time-exposure photographs.

Identify the latitude for your chosen viewing location.,
Measure the base of your telescope mount.,
From the edge of the plank, measure the distance to match the number of inches or mm calculated in step 2.,
Cut the plank.,
Mark the centers.,
Measure and mark the bolt holes.,
Drill the bolt holes.,
Install the hinge.,
Bolt the wedge to the top of the telescope mount, making sure you use washers on each bolt.

,
Decide how you will support the telescope mount base.,
Build the supports.,
Raise the board to the desired angle.,
At this point you should have a working wedge.,
You now have a platform for astrophotography!",How to Build an Equatorial Wedge for Your Telescope," For amateur purposes, you only need to narrow it down to an accuracy of one tenth of a degree, rounded up to the nearest tenth. For example, downtown Boston is located at 42.3 degrees north latitude. Write this down -- you will need it later on. There are several ways you can obtain the coordinates for the location.


With any GPS that can display your position (on a Garmin device, for example, the ""Where am I?"" screen will show your current coordinates).
Any smartphone app such as GPS Status that can do the same using the internal GPS.
With Google Earth

With Google Maps.;
, You will need to measure the length and width of the mount. Assuming that you already made sure your plank of wood is at least four inches wider than the mount, add four inches to the length of the mount at the base.

, Draw a line with the pencil across from edge to edge. From that line, measure twice the distance and draw a second line. Halfway between, draw a third line. The first measurement will give you the wood for the base mount, the second for the longer plank that will bolt to the top of the telescope tripod. In the end you should have three lines, all the same distance from each other.

, You will first cut one smaller piece for the telescope mount and a second piece, twice as long, for the tripod base. That piece will have the line you drew right across the middle.

, On the smaller piece, mark the center by drawing two lines diagonally from the corners. On the larger piece, do the same but from the edge to the line drawn halfway down its length.

, This part is tricky. You will need to measure the distance from the center of the telescope mount to the center of the bolt holes as well as the angles in order to mark and drill the holes. You'll need to do the same for the bolt holes on the top of the tripod, but keep in mind that the bolt hole layout may be different, so don't assume they are the same.

, You may have to adjust a bit and make the holes oversize to get them to fit properly. That's OK, as long as you use washers the boards will not move on the tripod. On the smaller board, use a jigsaw or small saw to cut from the edge of the board to the bolt hole whose radius is perpendicular to the edge, as shown in this image. The cuts should create a slot whose sides align with the edges of the drilled hole. This will make it easier to mount the telescope base to the wedge.

, If you have not done so already, cut the piano hinge to the width of the board for the telescope mount. Carefully align the hinge on the line you drew halfway down the length, clamp it down and install one side of it using two wood screws on each end. You can then remove the clamp. Place the telescope mount board next to the hinge with the slot cut away from the hinge, hold it as close to the hinge as possible and screw it to the side edge of the board. The hinge should touch the base and the telescope mount board should hinge up, as shown in the image.

,, At this point you can do one of two things. You can cut triangular pieces of wood to insert underneath the telescope mount board and hold it at a fixed angle, or you can cut larger pieces to attach on the outside of the long base board to support the telescope mount, but also give you the ability to modify the angle if needed. The tricky part here is the geometry. The top surface of the telescope base mount must be raised to an angle equal to the latitude of your location (you did write that down in step 1, right?) That angle needs to be as accurate as possible, but for amateur purposes the tolerances need not be microscopic.

, In my case, I used two pieces of wood, cut them roughly to the shape of a slice of pizza, with the radius about an inch longer than 1/2 the length of the telescope base mount board, and attached it to the outside of the wedge with screws. You can (and probably should) use a wood router to make dado cuts and apply glue. I used wood screws.

, Remember to measure the angle of the top surface of the board. Triple-check the angle, secure the board and drill holes on each side slightly smaller than the wood screws and into the edge of the board. Insert screws.

, All you need is a clear night, and an understanding of how to polar align the telescope. The shelf under the telescope mount board can be used to store eyepieces, or a larger battery to power the scope's electronics. Sand everything down to remove any splinters and sharp edges and finish to your preference.

, Enjoy!

Determine how you spend your time.,
Write down goals.,
Prioritize your goals.,
Plan your time.,
Realize that your time is valuable.",How to Use Your Time Wisely1," There are a variety of ways to do this. Try keeping a log or journal for several days. Or make a chart or graph illustrating how your time is spent. Be sure to keep track of everything that's taking up your time: sleep, work, eating, chores, school, etc.


Be honest with yourself here. This will show you how best to manage your time, especially if you find yourself upset at spending so much time in one area of your life.;
, Now that you know where your time is going, how would you like it to be spent? Mainly, what do you want to change about your current routine? If you noticed any wasted time, start by making a goal to address it.For example, if you found yourself spending several hours responding to pointless emails, taking extra breaks, or waiting for things, make it a goal to rescue that wasted time.

, This doesn't have to be incredibly detailed. Just rank your goals in the order in which you'd like to complete them. Try to put at least 30 percent of your weekly time towards accomplishing a goal.Re-evaluate your goals periodically. You may find after accomplishing some tasks that your priorities have shifted. Don't be afraid to alter your goals or plans.

, Give yourself a manageable range of time and make a list of the goals you must accomplish. Keep a separate list of things you'd like to get done. Then, look at your week and assign tasks for each day that get you closer to achieving your goals.


Remember to include time for family, relaxation, or personal time. While you don't need to detail what you'll be doing, you should be sure to block out the time.

, Don't allow your schedule to fill up with things that don't get you closer to your goals or that don't make you happy. If something seems like a waste of your time, try to cut it short or get out of it.


Likewise, don't feel like you have to accomplish everything yourself or it won't be done correctly. You'll most likely need to learn how to trust and let go in order to accomplish your tasks."

Research refractor telescopes.,
Read about reflectors.,
Consider getting a compact telescope.,
Try different telescopes before you buy.",How to Buy a Good Telescope1," Refractor telescopes are considered the best model when compared to telescopes with similar attributes (aperture, focal length, etc.). They are the best type of telescope to use to view planets or the moon. The design consists of a convex lens at one end of a sealed tube and an eyepiece at the other end. Refractors are also the most expensive kind of telescope., The reflector design is cheaper than the refractor telescope, but the images are less clear. This telescope might be a good purchase for a beginner. The reflector utilizes a set of concave mirrors in place of a lens. The primary mirror gathers light and sends it to the secondary mirror. The secondary mirror shoots the light out the side of the telescope to the eye piece., Compact telescopes combine both designs to create a solid middle choice. They are generally somewhere between the refractor and reflector in price and quality. The compact telescopes also use a technique of “folding” the light so that they can be made much shorter than other telescopes and keep the same focal length.Focal length is the distance between the primary lens and your eye.

, The best telescope to buy is the one that fits your needs most effectively. Locate a local astronomy club or observatory and ask to try out different telescopes. This way, you discover what you like before you buy your own telescope, and you make some contacts in the local astronomy arena."

Prepare yourself for the collimation process.,
Build your own collimation cap: pick the eyepiece's protection cap that came with your telescope, and drill a little hole in the exact center.,
The first mirror to be aligned is the secondary mirror (the diagonal flat one, under the eyepiece).,
In most of the cases, it's not the secondary mirror that needs to be aligned (jump to step 8).,
If you're confused with all the reflections, block the primary mirror with a piece of white cardboard.,
Align the secondary in the exact center of the image through the eyepiece: unscrew the three screws that lock the secondary mirror, and screw/unscrew the center screw to make the mirror go up/down.,
Take the piece of white cardboard off the tube.,
Now you need to align the primary mirror.,
You need to center the reflection of your eye in the center of the primary mirror.,
Remember: it is the image of your eye that needs to be centered in the primary mirror, not the spider!,
At this point, your scope is ready to go for deep-sky (except binary stars) and moon observing.,
Most people pick a stationary bright star like Polaris to do the fine tuning.,
Point your scope to your pseudo-stationary star.,
You need to center this target-like image.,
If you did everything right, your Newtonian telescope is now completely collimated, and you've spent absolutely zero money.",How to Collimate a Newtonian Telescope Spending Zero Money," You will need to be rested and your patience gauge must be full. Don't expect to do observing in the same night you start collimation if your telescope is way out of alignment, otherwise you'll rush things.;
, Remember: a LITTLE hole. You can do it using a pointed scissor. Put it into the eyepiece.

, You realize it needs collimation if you don't see the entire secondary mirror through the collimation cap and if you don't see the three locks over the primary mirror (the concave one, in the back of the scope).

, So don't mess around with it unless you're certain of its misalignment! You may need to collimate the secondary if you bought the scope second hand or if you have already messed up with it.

, Place a colored paper behind the secondary mirror, inside the tube of the telescope. For this step, you'll need to open your scope.

, WARNING: keep your scope in a horizontal position, so the secondary mirror won't fall on the primary.

, Now you need the center the reflection of the primary mirror in the secondary. Still using your homemade collimation cap, screw one of the three secondary screws, and start screwing the other two gradually until you see the three locks over the primary mirror. These locks are 120° apart from themselves, so they're easy to spot.

, It is a little easier then the secondary. Most new telescopes come with the exact center of the primary already marked, but if yours is not marked, you can do it by simply sticking a round piece of white paper in the exact center (take your time doing it: it must be the EXACT dead center). It won't trouble your observing as long as your piece of paper is smaller then the secondary mirror's diameter. I recommend using a piece of paper with half inch diameter (or 1 cm).

, Use the screws under the primary to do that. In most telescopes there are six screws, grouped in pairs. In this pair, one them is a locking screw, and the other is the adjusting one. Take your time to learn how they move the mirror.

, If your telescope has what we call a ""secondary offset"", the spider may be off center in the final results. But don't be bothered by that if the reflection of your eye is centered.

, You may stop the collimation process here. But if you want to observe the planets in the Solar System and binary stars, you NEED to do a fine tuning in your collimation, in a process called ""star test"".

, People in the Southern Hemisphere are not as fortunate, because finding a stationary star is way more difficult for them. But worry not: be smart! You can use any bright dot-sized light source to do the fine tuning, like antennae or far (really far) away street lights. This way you can do the fine tuning in cloudy nights and the light source is absolutely stationary. The results are the same.

, Use your highest magnification lens. Focus it. Now continue gradually rotating the focusing knob until you see a pattern that resembles a target (it may be off center) or a Doppler-effect illustration. If your scope is way out of fine alignment, you won't see this effect. But any slight over-focus will do the trick.

, Use the screws in the back of the primary mirror to do that. Be aware that your light source will MOVE A LOT and go out of view. Keep track of where it goes so you can find it again. This process may take a few hours of trial and error, but it is rewarding.

, No need to buy a 50$ piece of plastic or an abhorrently expensive laser collimator (even this laser may need collimation!).

Start with your most important goal.,
Say no.,
Multitask smartly.,
Be prepared.,
Delegate or ask for help.,
Remove distractions.,
Reward yourself.",How to Use Your Time Wisely2," This may be easy to determine if a big deadline is looming or a big event is coming up. Put the bulk of your energy towards completing the vital task, before moving on to less important items.Work on your biggest project at the time of day when you have the most energy. For some, this may be first thing in the morning. Others are night owls. Find what works for you and don't waste that valuable energy.

, Don't feel guilt tripped  into doing something you don't want to do. Job expectations aside, you shouldn't feel like you always have to agree to doing things. While simple requests might not seem like a big deal, they can pile up, leaving you overwhelmed and struggling to accomplish your actual goals. Learn to say no, without feeling guilty.


Don't feel like you have to explain yourself or give an excuse. Simply say that you can't do it, because it doesn't work out for you.

, While multitasking sounds like a great way to manage time, it's actually difficult to successfully pull off. Stick to multitasking when it comes to thoughtless jobs (laundry, dishes, making meals, etc).Don't try to write a memo while reading an article and talking on the phone. In other words, allow your mind to focus on one task at a time, preferably at a time of day when you work the best.For example, don't wait to do your homework at 2 am, when you're normally sleeping. If you realize your best window of working time is from 4 to 5 in the afternoon, plan to do it then.

, Don't let meetings, appointments, or deadlines surprise you. If you're prepared and have planned them into your day, they'll be more beneficial than if you were unprepared.When planning for a specific event, try to estimate how long it should take. If you find yourself going over time, try to wrap up the event or ask for another appointment.

, You may find that you have too many goals or tasks to accomplish. Try delegating responsibilities to co-workers or your family. This will free up valuable time for you to work on other projects or give you extra free time.Getting help will also provide you with people that check in on you. This can help you stay focused on the work you're doing while they're accomplishing their assigned tasks. Thank them and tell them how much you were able to get done with their help., This is increasingly hard to do. If you find yourself having trouble completing tasks, try turning off your cell phone, signing out of all social media sites, turning off the television, and go someplace quiet. You'll find that being able to focus on one task may increase your efficiency.Clear a visual space for work. This may be your desk, your office, or a room in your house. Having a clutter-free space will keep you from being distracted.

, If you've accomplished several goals or become more focused on your tasks, give yourself a small reward. This could be something as simple as a small personal break in the day, time out with friends, or allowing yourself extra sleep in the morning.

Know the aperture.,
Think about different eyepieces.,
Keep your telescope steady.",How to Buy a Good Telescope2," The aperture of a telescope is the diameter of it’s primary lens or mirror. The aperture determines how much light the telescope can gather. The more light the telescope can gather, the better you can see far off or small objects in the night sky., Changing the eyepiece on a telescope will alter the magnification of the instrument. Remember that magnification does not mean clarity. Blemishes in the image due to atmospheric conditions are also magnified, so a high magnification can quickly reduce the resolution of the image you see.Magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eye piece.
The maximum magnification for any telescope to show good resolution is two times its aperture in millimeters (or 50 times its aperture in inches)

, In order to see anything in the night sky clearly, you will need to have your telescope set on a sturdy base. Some telescopes use a tripod base. Other use a box shaped base. It is important that the base is secure and does not wobble or allow the telescope to drift."
"
Plot out your stargazing locations.,
List any celestial bodies you want to see.,
Remember you’ll be setting the telescope up in the dark.",How to Buy a Good Telescope3," If you are planning to stargaze in a busy city parking lot, you aren’t likely to see much with any telescope. Light pollution will disrupt the image and make it difficult for you to focus on any celestial objects. Find a place away from street lights, and busy roadways to do your stargazing., Not all planets, stars, comets, or other celestial objects can be seen at all times of the year. Make a list of the celestial bodies that are visible in your location when you go stargazing. Also, make a note of where those bodies are in relation to one another. This will make it easier for you to find them.Some telescopes come with software that will locate specific bodies, but they can be difficult to set up and orient properly.

, If you are a beginner, you should consider keeping your telescope design simple. Putting together a complicated instrument in the dark deters many people from using their telescopes. Alternatively, you could go out before sunset and set your telescope up, then wait for night time."

Studies show that time spent walking is more exciting than time spent waiting around for something. It helps if you can accomplish something productive along the way, but if not, it is still better than sitting around at home., Try “gamifying” chores and other work.

If people listen, you can begin selling advertisements for a bit of extra money or get your name out there as an expert on some topic.If you have strong opinions about politics, food, or culture, try writing about those things. Otherwise, try writing stories, or just expressing your feelings.
Similarly there are some websites that will compensate you for writing short articles.

, A number of survey websites allow you to make some money—usually not much—by telling them what you think. Some examples include SurveyMonkey, SurveySpot, My Survey, LIghtspeed Consumer Panel, Pinecone Research, Opinion OutPost, MyPoints, Springboard America, and Toluna. This is one way to spend your time and make a bit of cash on the side., Computer programs have bugs. To get out all the glitches and mistakes, programmers need people willing to play around with them. Websites like User Testing, WatusersDo, Enroll, and YouEye will compensate you for playing around with their programs. It isn’t a living, but it is one of the easiest ways to make money while wasting some time., Meditation might not seem like the most exciting activity, but it does increase concentration, which can help push away the sense of agitation that often comes with boredom. Try meditating about 20 minutes daily to increase your focus and clarity of mind.To meditate, close your eyes and clear your mind. Take one thing to focus on, perhaps an image in your head, a word, or a phrase. Think about that and whenever you mind begins to stray bring it back to the object of your attention.

Although it might defy our expectations, we also concentrate more on whatever we are doing when we doodling at the same time. This concentration will make whatever else we do, whether it be work or television, more interesting than it would be otherwise., Focusing on something artistic can be a good way to push away a sense of boredom.Generally, novelty also helps to alleviate boredom as well. So, try an online radio program that will play new songs with which you aren’t familiar. Alternatively, take the time to go through and listen to some classic music you’ve heard people talk about, but never listened to.

, Try making a cake or another complicated dish you’ve never tried before. This can be a good way to pick up a new skill and keep yourself busy. Even better, when everything is said and done, you have a tasty treat to eat, or, at least, a good story tell., Especially when it is cold outside, a warm bath can make quiet time fun. Aim to get the water to around 92 degrees. Turn off the lights and set some candles to create a relaxing atmosphere. Put on some music and toss some oil into the bath for a pleasant aroma., Boredom is easier to deal with than ever before, because the internet is something like a bottomless hole of activities. Read news websites, surf social media, or find aps and games that do novel things. Be careful thought; prolonged use of the internet will decrease your attention span, which will ultimately make it harder to be interested in the rest of the world around you., Once upon a time, reading was nearly the only reliable thing humans could turn to keep themselves interested. It is still a pretty good option. It requires more attention than the internet, which helps to keep you engaged. It will introduce you to interesting characters and in the end you might learn something about people, stories, or language.


Consider acting out what you learn by writing. As you read, break to take notes, write your own stories, or think about what your reading. This will make you a more active participant in the reading process.

Regardless of whether the sensation is good or bad, something novel is better at healing boredom than something that we are used to. In other words, you should be adventurous. Go somewhere or do something you don’t normally do, even if it is something you wouldn’t normally want to do.One good step in this direction is surround yourself with people who are, themselves interesting. This might mean people who are entertaining characters. Alternatively, it could also mean people who like to do new things, and will challenge you to come along and try something that otherwise wouldn’t even occur to you.

, One of the most natural solutions to boredom is daydreaming. However, evidence suggests that it only makes things worse. As our minds start drifting to an exotic locale, we just begin to think about how underwhelming what we are doing in the real world is, even if it is not actually that bad

, Studies have shown that quiet background noises that we barely hear actually have an important subconscious effect. Without us realizing, they distract us from whatever we are doing, making it seem more boring than it otherwise would. Turn off distant TVs or radios that might be distracting you. If the problem is harder to eliminate—like wind or a leaking faucet—trying moving somewhere else., In our modern electronic world, we are often so overstimulated that boredom is a rare phenomenon. Some people argue that boredom should be considered an opportunity to think more deeply than we otherwise would.That having been said, we all experience boredom differently, and some of us experience a much more disturbing type of boredom than others.You should judge for yourself whether a spot of boredom might be a good way to escape the concentration sapping distractions of the internet age."

We don’t always realize that we’re not giving certain persons enough time to talk, laugh and just “hang out”, so this is the time you’ll finally remember that friend you adore but can’t spend one hour with or that neighbour you always wanted to have a chat with. Find time for the people who matter, show them your support and most importantly show them that you do care about being with them because acts are certainly stronger than words.;
, For once, look for completely fresh music! We all agree that music is the most amazing thing ever, the universe itself agrees on this. It sounds crazy but it is now proven that music affects the way you conceive the world; so logically if your playlist is narrow, so is your perception. This is why it’s sometimes beneficial to search for music through the internet or on the radio or just type in random words on YouTube and see what you can tumble on.

, We’ll never say this enough: you haven’t truly lived unless you discovered how amazing books are. A proverb says: “Happiness is hidden in a book’s pages, in a mother’s arms and finally in a lover’s cuddle.”

, This is of course something to do with restrictions. You don’t even want to know all the side effects of eating too much dessert or food in general; but once in a while doesn’t hurt a bee. And don’t go on a diet, you wouldn’t want to miss this.

, Laughing is a remedy to everything! It helps the heart beat healthier, it lowers your blood pressure, it strengthens your facial muscles, it makes you look good… and you end up happier than the second before, so it’s a win win situation.

, People get more and more aware of the importance of keeping a healthy spiritual connection and how empowering meditation and contemplation can be. All your anger and anxieties disappear once you start doing these activities daily and efficiently. You start dealing with problems differently and with more confidence and stability than ever. So don’t forget that we are spirits trapped in a body, and make sure yours has peace and inner strength.

, If you’re under the same walls 24/7, don’t be surprised if nothing extraordinary happens to you. So to have action and rebounds you are actually going to have to get up, dress nicely, wear perfume and get away from home. If you don’t have money or can’t hang out with your friends, take yourself to the park, have a walk in your neighbourhood, visit friends or get them to come over… basically what you want to do is see different things, talk to different people and anticipate amazing events.

, Make your day memorable, stronger: why not making the day memorable for someone else as well? Give out your old clothes, volunteer in a shelter or association. Whenever you have the time, buy a meal for a homeless person, be polite to everyone you meet… And if you can’t go out, just help in house chores or give your mom a break at cooking for once.

, This is a very valuable advice. It will help you improve in ways you could never imagine and will keep on helping you involved as a person. Learning something new means that you need to fix a goal to yourself which is learning at least one thing everyday, and if you don’t you can pretty much double the goal next time. Learn a word’s meaning, a new ability, how to knit, the secret ingredient to your mom’s recipe, that player’s last name… Everything you add to your knowledge and experiment is useful in building your character and turning you into the person you always wanted to be. Remember to always make a recap of your day until you can fix the information in your brain. If not, they’re more likely to be forgotten.

Use old paint that’s been stored.,
Rearrange the furniture.,
Decorate with candles.,
Add plants and flowers to your space.,
Find beauty in new and unique ways.",How to Pass Time at Home1," Perk up a door, a table or a wooden chair that has seen better days by painting them. Try painting a concrete floor, perhaps in the basement laundry area. You can also use painter’s tape to make stripes to create borders on your walls. You are only limited by your imagination when redecorating your personal space.Unify your home with white paint. If the upper cabinets in your kitchen are different colors from either separate cabinet pieces, chairs or other pieces, think about painting everything white to bring them all together.Painting a room a different color than white, though, can really bring a space to life. Don’t let a fear of color make you choose beige, white or off-white all the time. Dark hues, for example, add depth and texture to a space. This is especially true if you have a large room with a high ceiling. Conversely, if you have a small room, lighter, brighter colors can really open up the space and make it look bigger.However, when painting, consider keeping the ceiling white or painting it a light color. Ceilings that are lighter help a room appear more open and larger.;
, Sometimes just moving your couch at an angle or into another corner can make a big difference in how a living room looks and feels. Think about how you can reposition the pieces you have to make a new look, even moving them into different rooms. Why not move that big, overstuffed chair into your bedroom near the window for a cozy, new reading nook?Before you rearrange, though, be sure to clear the clutter. Any disorganization in a room distracts from its beauty. When a place is cluttered, a person’s eye goes directly there, so all you’ll see is a pile of papers on the counter, laundry in the corner and toys on the floor versus your beautiful couch or amazing table.Figure out the focal point in each room. In some rooms, it’s a set of windows, a fireplace or a bed. In other rooms, it’s the television. Once you determine what it is, arrange your seating around it. You basically want the furniture to gravitate towards the natural focal point of each room.For rooms with more than one doorway, draw an imaginary line that angles through the room from opening to opening, creating a straight trail between the furniture. This keeps the dynamic arrangement of the furniture, but it also directs people through the space.Choose a face-to-face stance. Place two couches (or a couch and a pair of chairs) directly across from one another with the focal point at one end. Positioning furniture in this way is one of the best ways to facilitate conversation. If the TV is the focal point, then that’s also within eye’s reach but there’s still an emphasis on guests talking with one another., Candles look best with they’re all together, particularly on a large surface, like a dining room table. The larger the surface, the larger the candles should be. Also gather any small to medium-size mirrors that you’re not using, and place them underneath the candles for a nice, elegant look.Create a nice vibe in the eating area. Use a group of candles as a centerpiece on your table or even on your light fixture. Also using the same colors as the furniture pieces can help greatly in unifying a room.Group them together in a corner of your bathroom. Use vivid colors to brighten up a monochromatic bathroom, or match candles to the color of the walls.Create a warm glow with candles in the bedroom. Light them on a windowsill, a side table or add lovely sconces to create a nightly glow and a beautiful ambience. Candles almost always add an old-age appeal and a little whimsy to even the most modern and contemporary rooms., Greenery is a great way to liven up a home. Enlist the help of your friends or neighbors by asking them if they will divide up one of their plants up and give it to you. Then find a planter around your home for your new, organic friend.Think about moving any potted plants that you have outside, inside, and place them in a stairway, a windowsill or in a dreary corner. You also don’t have to go for the usual vases and pots. Chances are that your recycling bin has some cans in it. Take out a few, add soil and a young plant or two, and you’ve got some beautiful planters.Use clear, small glasses of different shapes and sizes for holding cut flowers, and group them together on a table to make an inexpensive and stylish statement.Save counter space by planting different herbs in mason jars. Then think about mounting them near your kitchen. This unique wall decor will really stand out when friends and family come over.Fill an awkward space with a planter. Put a large plant in a colorful container in a bare area of one of your rooms. Small ideas like this can really make a difference., Take a look around for items that have visual appeal. Whether it’s an old kimono or your collection of boots, displaying them in a conscious way will boost both the objects and the room. Even that wicker chair with a hole on the seat can be covered with a tray and put next to the bed for a shabby chic, night stand.Think about adding a cheeky piece of furniture to a room. Consider putting a playful, swinging seat in one corner of a room. It’s comfortable, fun and it’s the very thing people’s eyes will focus on when they come in."

Get rid of clutter.,
Take 30 minutes to think about your professional and personal goals.,
File your paperwork.,
Eliminate your concerns.",How to Pass Time at Home2," One of the reasons you may not be as productive or as creative as you may want to be in life is because you have too much clutter. Things you can do to get more organized include removing books you’ll never read from your bookshelf and deleting the apps that you’ll never use from your Smartphone. Not only will you have done some housecleaning, but also they will give you the motivation to move on to the next larger de-cluttering task.Also consider writing down the activities that take place in each room. Walk through your home with a notebook and pen, and jot down the different activities. Note your desired use for each room, and remove anything that doesn’t relate to the activities for that space.Pick an organization to donate to. Getting rid of things is easier if you can visualize someone benefitting from them. The rule of thumb is that unless it’s something that you only use once or twice a year, if you’ve haven’t used it in more than 6 months, then you probably don’t need it.The next time you’re putting away laundry, grab some of the clothes that you haven’t worn in a while, and try them on in front of a mirror. Put the ones back into circulation that you still like and that fit you well back into circulation, and donate the rest., If you don’t have a list of goals, begin one. If you already have one, review them. Write down a list of action steps you can take over the few weeks to bring some of these goals to fruition. The more you focus on them, the more likely they are to come true.Also be sure to do your goals as early in the day as possible. If you study highly productive people, you will find that a large number of them accomplish many of their goals early in the morning.

, If you’re on top of your game, you do it immediately. Or, if it’s not your thing or you’ve been really busy, you may have a bunch of files and documents lying around. Just doing this one task, especially if it has built up, will make you feel that you are controlling life versus it controlling you.Be colorful. Files with different colors for your tabs and labels can not only turn your organizing system into a work of art, but they’re also a lot easier to find.Put important papers in a place where you know they’ll be safe. Keep your documents in a safe place, but also make sure that you can easily get to them when you need them.

, Are you worried about something in particular? Is it getting in the way of how productive you are? Deal with the issues that are keeping you from spending your time as well as you probably would otherwise. By removing as many stressors as possible, your headspace will be a lot clearer to focus on other more positive aspects of living."

Teach yourself how to draw.,
Learn how to sew.,
Get into yoga.",How to Pass Time at Home3," Many people will tell you to take art lessons if you want to learn how to draw but that can be a little intimidating if you’re a complete beginner. So why not learn at home? If you browse on the Internet, you’ll see that there are lots of great websites offering free and paid lessons, and also YouTube has thousands of terrific videos on the subject.Have patience with yourself. Even for skilled artists, the beginning of a drawing can look frightening. But it almost always can be corrected. You’ll be surprised, too, at how well a drawing will turn out to be when you’re finished with it.Practice drawing a pet or roommate. Draw Charlie, your pit-bull dog, when he’s sleeping or when he’s playing in the backyard with a ball. Or, if you have a roommate, start sketching the person while they’re making dinner. Once they leave the room, then finish the drawing from a photo that you have of them. Consider enlarging it so that you can see the person or animal’s features better.Experts say that it takes about 10,000 hours of doing something before you become expert at it. If that amount of time overwhelms you, don’t let it because you have to start somewhere., One of the best things you can do is buy a good beginner’s book. Look for one that has clear, step-by-step instructions. You also want it to have simple patterns for some basic garments and home decoration items as well. Look for real pattern paper in the book, too. You will also need a good machine. There isn’t anything more discouraging when learning to sew than on a temperamental sewing machine. Vintage machines are actually some of the best but zig-zaggers work well, too.Start with small sewing projects. It’s a lot more fun to sew something simple and do it well then tackling something too advanced and being disappointed with the results. You’ll learn either way, but it’s easy to get discouraged when the results don’t match what your expectations were.Like any other skill, you’ll need lots of practice. After a while, sewing tasks that seemed difficult at first become second nature.

, It’s best to begin learning how to do yoga under the guidance of a qualified teacher; however that can either be by taking classes in your community or by watching videos from teachers who you know are highly qualified, along with being certified. The reason you want them to be qualified is to avoid possible injuries. Be sure that the teacher or video that you find provides gentle, warm-up exercises first. This is very important, as it helps to loosen up the body and prepare for the actual yoga set.


Even if you’re someone who can’t touch their toes, it doesn’t mean yoga is not for you. Actually yoga is for everyone regardless of how tight their body may be. In fact, yoga is even more for people who feel tight in their bodies. Yoga is a process of uniting with oneself, using breath, body and mind. With some practice, you’ll find that you become a lot more limber, too.

You can even start by writing something like, ""I'm so bored"" and describing your boredom.
If you enjoy creative writing, start writing that novel, poem, or short story you've always wanted to find the time to write.
Start a blog. If it feels a little silly to write with no particular goal, start blogging about a subject that interests you.

If you don't have any old DVD's online, you can stream many movies for free through services like Netflix and Hulu.If you don't have people around to watch old movies with, see if a friend wants to watch the same movie you're watching and chat about it via text. This can feel like having someone over.

, Oftentimes, people feel bored with friends because they lack the funds to do something. However, you don't need a lot of money to go shopping. If you're bored, but a little broke, hit up your local thrift store. You can find a variety of new clothing items for a relatively low price.Even if you don't end up buying anything, it can be fun to simply try on funny outfits you find at a thrift store.

, If you and your friends can't think of anything to do, pretend you've never been to your town before. Plan a day seeing all the local attractions and eating at local restaurants. This is a chance for you and your friends to revisit places in your town you may take for granted.Think of things to do that tourists frequently do in your town. Go to a local museum or go hiking on local nature trails.
Is there a staple restaurant or diner in your city? Try hitting that up for something to eat.

, If you and your friends can't think of anything to do, put on some fancy clothes and makeup and have a photo-shoot. You can use a camera or smart phone to take pictures of you and your friends in a variety of poses. You can even go outside and take fun outdoor pictures.You don't have to do a serious photo shoot if you're not in the mood. You can take funny pictures to laugh at later.

Look at funny or cute pictures online.,
Bake.,
Make unique mix CDs.,
Dance.,
Look through old photos.,
Watch funny videos online.",How to Overcome Boredom4," The internet can be a great way to entertain yourself. Try googling something like, ""Cute pug photos"" and spend some time looking at adorable pictures of dogs. You can also browse videos of cute animals or babies to pass the time.If you're talking to a friend who is also bored, you guys can share video clips and photos you find of cute things online.

, If you're at a loss for what to do, browse your cabinet. You probably have some flour and sugar. See what baking supplies you have and find a recipe online you can easily make. Doing some baking can be a fun and productive way to pass the time.If someone you know has a birthday coming up, you can try baking them something.

, If you have blank CDs lying around, try making some mixes. You can make mixes for friends, or make CDs for yourself. You can, for example, make a CD to listen to while driving.Go for creative mixes, as these will keep you thinking about what to add. For example, don't do a mix like, ""Best Songs of the Summer."" Instead, try something like ""Best Songs of the Summer of 1997.""
You can also just try mixes centered around a random topic or feeling. For example, you can make a mix of songs about animals, songs that make you sad, or songs that make you want to get moving.

, Turn on some music and start dancing around your living room. You don't have to worry about looking silly if no one is watching. Even if you don't usually like dancing, you may have more fun than you expect if you're just dancing alone for fun.If you're interested in learning how to dance, try watching someone online dancing videos and imitating the moves.

, Old photographs can be fun to revisit. You may be surprised, for example, to see how much you've changed since 8th grade. You may laugh when looking through pictures from your freshmen year of college, as you'll be amazed by how different your style is now.If you don't have physical pictures lying around, look through old digital albums. You can browse your oldest Facebook album, for example.

, There are many comedians who operate YouTube channels and post funny content. You can also watch clips of standup comedians online. If you're feeling bored, try looking at funny content online. Laughter will make the hours pass by more easily.If you don't know where to start, a simple Google search for something like ""best online comedians"" or ""funny videos"" should yield plenty of results to keep you busy.

Be aware that high arousal states can contribute to boredom.,
Get off the internet, computer, or couch.,
Avoid daydreaming.,
Keep a schedule of your day.,
Be social.,
Take breaks to keep tasks from becoming mundane.,
Quiet your work space.,
Regulate your blood-sugar.When your blood-sugar levels drop, you'll start noticing that it's increasingly difficult to pay attention to your work.,
Stay active.,
Get a job or volunteer.",How to Overcome Boredom5," You might associate boredom with a dull environment or feeling sleepy and lethargic, but people can also appear to be bored when they are overwhelmed by outside stimuli or when they are feeling really energetic on the inside and cannot focus as a result.For example, you might feel bored if you are at a busy café with loud music and lots of people talking around you. This might be the result of external stimulation from all of the noise overwhelming you or distracting you from completing a task.Or, you might think you are bored because you are bursting with energy and you can't seem to focus on one thing for more than a minute or two. Excess energy can come from normal sources, such as being well-rested or feeling nervous about an upcoming flight. When you feel this internal overstimulation, you might mistake it for boredom.
If you are feeling overwhelmed by outside stimuli, then try to reduce it. For example, if your environment is too loud, then you could put on headphones and listen to some music or white noise. Or, you could try to go somewhere with fewer distractions.
If you are overly energetic, then try doing something to expend some of your energy, such as going for a walk. Then, return to what you were doing after the walk.

, Unless you've got a show you really want to watch, avoid using TV or social media to fill time. This can lead you to start fantasizing about what you'd rather be doing. Studies have shown that this can make boredom seem more intense., Daydreaming about other places and more desirable activities will intensify boredom rather than alleviate it. Catching yourself in the middle of a daydream will likewise give you the impression that the activity you're engaging in is boring, even if you would normally find it stimulating.


If you enjoy the occasional daydream, repetitive tasks like scrubbing the floor or mowing the lawn are a good opportunity for daydreaming. Tasks that require little ""presence"" won't be noticeably affected by daydreaming.

, If you notice any large gaps in your schedule, try to fill them in with something that interests you. You may notice you feel bored and frustrated around the same times each day. It's a good idea to try to schedule in a particular activity during these times to prevent boredom., You can join a club or a youth group to have structured time or make plans with friends on your own. If you're feeling like there's nothing to do, there's no better way to overcome idle boredom than being with people. Call your friends and organize an outing, or bug one of your neighbors for a pickup game of basketball. Even if you're just walking downtown together, or getting coffee, you're doing something new. Hang out with your regular friends, or reconnect with old acquaintances to shake up your routine.


There's no substitute for face-to-face socializing. Avoid using social media sites to replace socializing, and meet with people in person.
Go to camps. What's coming up? Spring Break? Christmas Break? Summer? Look up fun camps to plan to go to during free time such as Cpacstudios.com.

, A recent study found that subjects who took two-minute breaks in the middle of a boring 50-minute task felt more focused, relaxed, and productive at the end of the task.If you're setting out on a long project, give yourself something to look forward to by queuing up a YouTube video, song, or article you're looking forward to reading and reward yourself for thirty minutes of work with a short two-minute break.


Get out of your work space for a quick minute. Even if you just walk to the kitchen for a glass of water, those few minutes can be refreshing. Go out to the garden and smell the flowers to get some fresh air.

, It's a common misconception that leaving the radio or television on quietly in the background will create a relaxing and productive workplace. Unfortunately, this tends to divide your attention on a subconscious level. You end up feeling more bored than if you were to work in total silence. Focusing on one task entirely, even if that activity is ""boring,"" is a smarter idea than dividing your brain with competing stimuli.


Use music or radio as a reward, rather than a distraction. Taking measured breaks over the course of a boring activity will end up making you more productive than trying to push through without one, but letting radio chatter along in the background throughout.

, Keep healthy snacks like nuts or fruit available in your work desk to keep your brain functioning at its highest level. Reward yourself with a bit of chocolate for finishing a particularly difficult homework assignment or series of memos at the office.


Energy drinks and other caffeine sources are popular, but the ""crash"" associated with high-sugar caffeine drinks will end up affecting your productivity in the long run. Avoid these stimulants to keep from falling back in the bored rut.

, Some people like working on exercise balls instead of computer chairs, or using other ergonomic office gear to stay active, but you don't have to spend a lot of money to get moving. Popping out of the office for a quick walk, or taking fifteen minutes to do a light stretching routine in the bathroom will increase your energy levels and keep your attention from waning.


If you have a treadmill, try working on a treadmill desk. Standing up and working has proven to be a healthy and efficient way to stay focused.

, If you consistently find yourself with too much free time, consider getting a part-time job or volunteering. Making money or helping people will fill up your free time in a productive way that leaves you feeling fulfilled. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Retail, such as stores and cafes, are great places to get a part-time job. They tend to offer flexible working hours, making them ideal for students.
Hospitals, nursing homes, soup kitchens, and animal shelters are almost always looking for volunteers. Aside from being rewarding and emotionally fulfilling, volunteer work like this looks very attractive on resumes or college applications.
Consider being self-employed. You can offer to mow people's lawns for them, walk their dogs, or babysit. If you are crafty, you can even make things, such as scarves or bags, and sell them online.

If you get motion sickness and/or vomit, take some Dramamine, which will make you super drowsy and clock out a few hours while you're sleeping.,
Bring your iPod.,
You can sleep.,
You can draw.,
You can read.,
You can even plug a Playstation or Xbox into a DVD player.,
Use laptops or anything, be creative.,
Try to get your parents to pick a good time to travel.,
Make periodic stops for food and to use the the restroom.",How to Stay Entertained on a Long Car Ride (for Teens)," When you start to read, draw, whatever, you won't vomit all over the place.;
, Add some new songs or movies so you have some new material to listen to or watch. Listening to the songs, reflect on your life and your dreams and passions, etcetera. Daydream to songs. Movies are super cool too. You can also buy some TV shows. I always make a wish list on iTunes for months and save money so by the time you have your road trip you have a ton of stuff in mind.

, You might think it wouldn't be fun, but catching up on sleep would be great, and no one would try to bother you. You'll probably already be at your destination when you wake up.

, Buy some new sketch books and writing utensils so you'll be excited for it! Write a comic maybe.

, Books really pass time! Driving is prime time to catch up on whatever reading. Just make sure that you don't get carsick and puke all over the place.

, To power it, buy an a/c adapter so you can plug normal plugs into the electrical plugs in the car.

, Use the a/c adapter and you can go on for hours. Enjoy yourself. Write a short story, or even start a novel! Write your life story. Beforehand download games, or install games, like the Sims!!! It'll be super fun.

, It makes a difference. The hardest trip to pull off, entertainment wise, is when you depart between 7am-3pm. You will be fully awake and energised, and traffic will make the ride less enjoyable. If you leave at around 7pm or sunset it is fun, because it's like pulling an all nighter. BUT, if you take a Dramamine, you'll be asleep anyway.

, Maybe stop at one quick attraction or landmark. Or keep on going, so you can get there faster. Stretch your legs whenever possible!

,Learn how to tie dye with the many different, fun, and creative designs!",How to Not Get Bored During Summer Vacation," You might have been thinking of doing it while you were in school, but you were probably too busy. Now that school is out, try re-arranging your room! A whole new look can be really refreshing, and it gives you a chance to let your creative juices flow.;
, This can help cure boredom in no time, just remember to block your caller ID.

, Pulling an all-night'er can be tons of fun. Just don't get caught, though.

, It's quite fun to have friends in your house.

, Do some pretty nail art - let those creative juices flow.

, This helps us contribute to the website, plus it is a lot of fun. However, don't stay on the computer for too long. It could make you really tired.

, Minecraft, Sims, and World of Warcraft are all good ideas. You could also play some in browser games, such as Animal Jam or Webkinz.

, Everyone needs a snack every now and then. Eat to your hearts content (just don't overeat - you don't want to get sick.)

, If you have one, chances are, your pet is just as bored as you.

, If you don't want to read a whole book, take it a chapter at a time, or skim the room for pamphlets or signs on the desk or captioned posters on the wall. Search for bottles of hand sanitizer or even read the labels on the bottoms of your shoes.

,, Not only did you beat boredom, you'll also have some nice cookies to nibble on.

,, It's surprisingly amusing and you can challenge yourself!

, Maybe they are really bored and want to have fun as well.

, Get in touch with an old friend in pen-and-paper form. Write a full letter, or find a funny postcard and adorn it with cartoons and drawings of your cat. Address your boredom in the letter. The fact that you thought to reach out to a friend will impress and entertain them. Catch them up on your interests, successes, and dreams.

,, Don't watch TV or use Facebook to ""fill time"". Concentrating on something like crafts can be fun and educational, a conversation you're really excited about having on the internet, or an article or website you're having fun exploring. Some studies show that spending time fantasizing about what you'd ""rather be doing"" makes boredom more intense, and that spending time online looking at your friend's vacation pictures can make those bored feelings worse.

, Learning the rules is somewhat complex, but it's a good skill to pick up. Then, you'll know how to play forever. If you don't like the game, nix it and learn another.

, What are your top ten films starring superheroes? What are your top five things to eat on rainy days? What was your worst Christmas? Writing out a list can be a fun way to pass the time.

, Organize your room or office, wash the dog, do some gardening, or work on homework. At the end of the day, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you did something productive.

, Grab a friend. Both of you get a 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle of Diet Coke. Both of you should put mentos in each bottle. When the fountain sprouts, see whose fountain goes up higher! (Make sure you each put the same amount of mentos!) Make sure to use mint mentos. They don't have a coating like the flavored ones do, so they explode better.

, These can be stubs which are always fun to expand.

, Especially if you live in an area where summers are hot, you can have fun and cool off at the same time!

, Play Marco Polo and have chicken fights, where people sit on each other's shoulders and try to knock each other off. Or play a sport such as cricket, frisbee or football. You can have swimming races and do underwater acrobatics or dive for pennies.

, Put on a swimsuit, or just wear some casual clothes you can get wet. Play some of the usual games you'd enjoy outside (such as tag, hide-and-go-seek, jumping on the trampoline, or red rover) with the added challenge of having a sprinkler or two going in the yard.

, Fill up some water balloons, buy a cheap water gun at the dollar store, or find a hose attachment that sprays water further than before, and start a water fight! (Just make sure you don't hit anyone in the face or throw water balloons at breakable surfaces, such as glass.)

,, Using light sheets and blankets, put up a blanket fort using chairs, tables and couch cushions for walls. If you want, set up a fan at one end, grab a cold drink, and read a book or take a nap inside.

, Experiment with different flavors as you get better at making them!

,, Create different colors using food coloring.

, These balloons can travel hundreds of miles in a day, and are very easy to make.

, You can figure out how to fold hearts, boxes, birds, and other great objects.

, Try different, even wacky combinations. Make an afternoon out of it: Go to the supermarket and buy weird, interesting ingredients like ketchup and pistachios. Experiment. Make a gross smoothie and dare your friends to drink it.

, Eat burgers, hot dogs, and iced tea. Play bingo on the porch. Have everyone bring in cool prizes that you can compete for.

, It's fun to try new things!

,, So open up your cupboards.

, It'll keep you busy, introduce you to new people, and you'll earn money for new stuff! Possibly the best option is to work at a festival.

, Take your pet for a walk, teach it a new trick, give it a bath, or just spend time relaxing together.

, By starting a band, you can make new friends and you can show off your skills.

, If they're away, make new ones. Ask your friends if they know anyone who's going to stick around for the summer, get their numbers, call them up and say ""I'm a friend of ______. He/she told me you were going to be around this summer. Wanna hang out?"" And if you're too shy, try calling people you've lost touch with over the years — these are people you already know you can get along with. Plus, you'll have a ton to talk about, either catching up on what you've both been up to or reminiscing.

, Helping your community will give you a good feeling about yourself and will also make good use of your time. Try something in the sun like a beach clean, or working with animals. volunteering also looks good on college applications!

, This may seem totally dorky (or totally weird), but it can be really fun. Ask your Dad to play catch in the park, or take your Mom to the spa for some manicures and facials! Try not to totally neglect them over the summer, and try to be nice!

, Invite some friends over, get some water balloons, a radio, strobe, bonfire, and bring lots of food!

, Books can transport you into a different world or let you see through the eyes of others.

, Solve puzzles, organize and clean, and learn new things (summer is an excellent time to get a head start on the next term). Studies have shown that your I.Q. drops significantly during long sessions of limited use, such as summer.

, It can be about anything at all. You could start a project with a friend where you both write a story along the same theme. If you don't want to share it with people you know you can upload it onto the internet and share it with others, or you could just keep it to yourself.

, Write a letter to your favorite friend or family member telling them why they're so awesome!

, If that stuff isn't for you then you could also do AP World History classes online. It's really fun and it makes you get in touch with your history loving side.

, Try Tichu, Pit or Bohnanza.

, If you can't go to a campsite, try your own backyard (but pick up the dog poop) or go wild camping. Get a tent and tell spooky stories. Have someone you know and trust sneak up on your tent and scare the heck out of your friends!

, Grab a couple friends and turn your room into a palace, or the jungle, or a hotel, or whatever. Buy some cool food and wacky ""souvenirs"", and have a vacation (i.e. sleepover) at your house. Ideas: complementary breakfast, set chocolates on people's pillows, fold towels, set everything up nicely.

, Make a bouquet. Be sure no one planted them!

, Sort through your clothes, and pick out the ones that you don't want/are too small for you. Have a garage sale with some friends, and ask them to bring some clothes/other items they don't want. Sell as much as you can, and whatever doesn't sell, give it to charity. With the money you earned, go to your favorite shop and buy some better clothes.

, Mario Kart Wii is a great time-waster. So is MLB Manager Online, if you like baseball. But don't let it take up too much of your time or you may become depressed.

, What do you want your grades to be like? Do you want to be more social? What do you want to achieve in your life? What do you want to be remembered for? What classes do you want to take for this year and years to come? Make resolutions and write them down so you remember.

, There are lots of people who have diaries, so why don't you?

, You can listen to the bands you like, or find others bands to listen to, too!

Draw something.,
Play with figurines.,
Dance.,
Play one-player games.,
Play video games.,
Use a hobby kit.",How to Play With Yourself1," Everyone has an imagination, but not everyone is good at accessing it. One of the easiest ways to have fun by yourself while tapping into your imagination is to sit down at a table with pens, pencils, markers, or crayons and start drawing. Be sure to set out plenty of scrap paper, and don't hold back: just keep drawing and drawing until you hit on something you like. Expand it, add details (and color, if you have colored items), and keep building on it until you're satisfied.


You don't have to show your doodles to anyone else if you don't want to. Just recycle them when you're finished, if you don't want to keep them.;
, Playing with dolls, action figures, and other such figurines is a time-honored children's tradition the world over, and for good reason: It's a great way to pass time when there's nothing else to do. If you don't own toys, you can buy some, make some, or use decorative figurines. Assign each of them a name and title, and move them around to act out stories. Give them distinct voices and personality quirks.


Try using a crumpled blanket or stacked books to create “scenery” for your characters. Perhaps one figure is a lone U.S. Marshal riding down a box canyon made of books, about to be ambushed by a desperado; maybe it's a witch on a broomstick, about to rescue someone from jumping off a bridge. The possibilities are endless.

, You're at home alone, so why not? Pick some music, crank the volume, and start shaking to it. You might be surprised how much fun it actually is. Mix things up by putting on music you don't think you could dance to (such as a slow piece of classical music) and try to dance to it anyway. Let your body express the sounds and emotions of the songs. This is a great way to improve your mood and get some exercise, too.


Be sure the front door is locked before you go wild, unless you want someone who lives with you to walk in and see you dancing around crazily. The time it takes them to unlock the door is all the time you need to stop dancing and try to make your face look serious.

Trying to look serious after dancing usually just makes you laugh even harder, but isn't having a good time the whole point?


Clear plenty of space before you dance. Once you begin to get into it, it's easy to lose track of where your body is moving.

, This includes one-player variants of social games. The best known one-player game is probably Klondike solitaire, a simple matching game played with cards. Other solitaire card games include Pyramid and Spider. Aside from card games, marbles can be played by yourself, as can checkers and even chess. Obviously, the challenge of such a game is limited, but the chances to learn and practice strategy are plentiful. You can also shoot hoops, throw darts, or practice trick shots in pool by yourself, provided you have the necessary equipment.


Solo marbles is as easy as setting an X of marbles inside a circle, and then taking shots from outside with a larger marble (the taw) and trying to knock out all the small marbles. It can be played indoors, provided you have tape for a square ring and enough smooth flooring to take shots.
There is a massive list of solitaire card games available on Wikipedia. Note that not every variant version of these games is actually explained.
Proprietary games, such as Magic: the Gathering and other collectible card games, can be played in solo matches in much the same way as chess or checkers. Playing decks against each other is a useful way to test strategies and deck balance.
Putting on music in the background is a great way to help time pass quickly while playing a solo game, as well as keep track of how much time has passed. Just make a note of the length of your playlist or album, and you'll know what time it is when it ends.

, Today more than ever, video games are everywhere. Even if you don't own a console (such as a Wii or PS3) for playing games, there are many thousands available for your computer and phone. Most of these are designed for one player. Some pit you against other online players; a few are best in the company of friends (especially go-kart racing games and fighting games). Avoid these if you truly want to play by yourself, and look into action-adventure games and role playing games instead.


There are many free games available to play online. Try Yahoo! Games for a large selection of recent and classic titles, or http://www.onemorelevel.com/ for a smaller, curated list that's easy to navigate and includes some lesser-known (but still fun) titles.

Some free games allow you to pay money to unlock extra features or get an edge. Don't pay for anything unless you're 100% sure you want to. Remember, it's just a free Internet game.


Don't discount older game consoles. Many fun games were made for consoles like the NES, Sega Genesis, and original PlayStation. These games, and the systems that play them, can often be bought for a tiny fraction of their original cost from garage sales and thrift shops.

, If you have free time and no one to spend it with, why not build or make something for fun? Try gluing and painting a model plane or car, or building a model rocket from a kit and then launching it behind a nearby school over the weekend. Some craft stores even sell kits that allow you to make working robots, grow neon-colored crystals in water, and do a whole range of other fun and offbeat things. Most of these kits cost less than $30, and are a great way to while away an afternoon.


Other kits include sand art, jewelry, and dreamcatcher kits. Shop around and see what's out there!
You can also make your own “kit” by purchasing basic parts and keeping them in a box or bag together. Try making your own scented soaps or bath salts, beeswax candles, T-shirt designs (with decals and fabric paint), or even wine (if you're old enough).

Play solo sports.,
Explore.,
Go down a hill.,
Sight see.,
People watch.",How to Play With Yourself2," With a bouncy ball, it's easy to play handball by yourself: just find a wall and bounce the ball off it at different angles, trying to keep it in play by swatting it back each time for another bounce. You can also shoot hoops at a park with a basketball, if nobody else is using the court. Practice your soccer (football) footwork by jogging across a field while kicking a ball ahead of you, or race yourself by running to a set point and back.


You can practice less traditional sports by yourself, too. Try keeping a footbag (Hacky Sack) in the air as long as possible, throw a flying disc (Frisbee) as far as you can, or play a solo game of horseshoes, if there's a public pit in your area.
If there's a public range in your area, archery is a great sport to play by yourself, since it's generally always a solo sport. Getting the basic equipment to play archery is a bit expensive, but you shouldn't have to pay more than around $150, which is still a lot cheaper than the cost of getting into certain other sports.

, Whether by car, bicycle, or on foot, exploration can be a fun way to pass time in your neighborhood. Try picking a direction and just heading that way. For a more outdoorsy experience, go to a park with a wooded area, then throw a baseball or flying disc as far into the woods as you can. Follow it in and search for it, then repeat until you've crossed the woods.


Be sure to read signs carefully. Some parks don't allow foot traffic off of designated paths in wooded or brushy areas. Always respect the rules.
If you plan to explore outside of town, be sure you have a compass and a topographic map, and know how to use them. This skill is called orienteering. It's easy to learn and can save your life.

, This is another popular pastime with children everywhere. By letting gravity do your work for you, you can enjoy fast movement speeds without having to exert yourself very hard. If you live somewhere with nearby snow, buy a sled or similar item and go sledding by yourself. If you have a city park nearby, find a hill there, lay sideways, and roll down the hill. (Be sure to check for dog poop first.)


You can bring a bicycle or scooter to go even faster, but be sure to watch out for others who might be in your way at the base of the hill, since it takes much longer to stop a speeding bike than it does to stop a rolling body.

, Use a bike, a car, or public transportation to visit places of local interest and beauty. Take a camera (or camera phone) with you, and snap photos of every pretty panorama or interesting feature you notice. Even just traveling alongside streets can sometimes reveal pretty houses and yards to photograph. Try keeping a record of where you go each season, and coming back to the best spots every few months to see how they change with the passage of the seasons.


To turn your sightseeing into a game, note any unusual feature you find (such as a rare flower or a four-leaf clover) at one location, and then try to match it up with a photo of the same feature somewhere else in town. If you have an eye for detail, you could spend months finding and matching all sorts of things.

, One of the best ways to spend time outside is to sit on a bench near a busy street and watch people pass by. Note their outfits, faces, and body language, as well as what accessories they have and which direction they're headed. Try adding details to their lives, such as whether or not they secretly wear crazy socks to work, or what they think of jazz music. Turn them into characters in your head. It's more fun than you might think from reading about it.


You can turn people watching into a game using the same method as you use for sightseeing.
Don't stare at people. The goal is to go unnoticed so you can continue to enjoy being outside and people watching. If you catch someone's eye, smile politely and look away. Consider bringing a cup of coffee or tea so you have something to shift your focus to quickly.

Explore.,
Play a pocket game.",How to Play With Yourself3," If you're stuck on a long shopping trip, you're there with someone else who's doing things that don't interest you. Excuse yourself by telling the other person you're going to have a look around, and agree on a meeting place and time to get back together. Head off and distract yourself any way you can. Even when nothing seems interesting, you can usually find things to look at. Try reading nutrition labels or looking at brand icons in a supermarket, for example.


Don't forget, you can also go outside the building and see what the back lot looks like.
Be sure the person you're with hears and understands you when you set a place and time. Ask them to recite it back to you so you know you're both on the same page about the location in particular.
If you're young enough, you can usually get away with sitting down in a corner and actually playing with die-cast cars or other small toys inside a store. Don't expect to get away with this if you're a teenager or older, though.

, Between phones and handheld game consoles like the Nintendo 3DS, there are many games available to play on the go. Prepare ahead of time and bring along an alternate game or two in case you get stuck on one. If you can't find a good place to sit and play your game, check for benches outside the front of the building, or chairs in the back near restrooms and fitting rooms.


As with console games at home, don't forget that there are several older handheld systems available for relatively little money, most of which had many fun games made for them. You don't have to buy a top-of-the-line system to have fun.

Chain two and half-double crochet into third loop.,
Chain two and half-double crochet into front loop.,
Alternate between HDC into third loop and HDC into front loop.",How to Crochet the Camel Stitch1," Start by making a chain appropriate for the length of your project.The length of the chain will depend on the gauge of your yarn as well as on the types of project you want to create.


For example, if you are creating a blanket with a 10mm hook and bulky weight yarn, then you will need to make a chain of 178 or more.;
, For the second row, skip the first stitch in your chain and then start your half-double crochet on the second stitch.Then, continue to half-double crochet to the end of the row.


To half-double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook before you insert it into the back stitch (top stitch furthest from you) and then loop the yarn over the hook again. Pull this yarn through the back stitch, then yarn over again and pull this loop of yarn through the other three loops on your hook., For the third row, first chain two stitches and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is on the back side of your stitches. Half-double crochet into this third loop.To locate the third loop, count three stitches moving from the front to the back. The first is the front stitch (the one closest to you and nearest the top), the second is the back stitch (right next to the front stitch), and the third stitch is right behind the back stitch.
Continue to HDC to the end of the row.

, For the next row, you will be half-double crocheting into the front stitch, which is the top stitch closest to you. First, chain two and then HDC. Continue to HDC to the end of the row., To complete your project you will simply be alternating your rows between half-double crocheting into the third loop and half-double crocheting into the front loop. Continue to crochet in this fashion until you have achieved the desired length."

Continue to chain two and half-double crochet into third loop.",How to Crochet the Camel Stitch2," Start by creating a chain of however many stitches you need to complete your project.Check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches you will need to chain.


For a thick scarf, you might make a chain of 30 to 50 stitches, depending on the size of your yarn and crochet hook. Then, you could work this chain in the round until it is the length you want it to be. You could also make a cowl in this way.
To work in the round for a hat, start with a chain of five. This will allow you to work the camel stitch outwards from a small circle. If you choose to work the camel stitch this way, then your garment will have a spiral look to it., After you finish your chain, use the slipstitch to connect in in a circle.Be careful not to twist the chain.


To do a slipstitch, insert your needle through the back loop of the beginning of the round, then loop the working end of your yarn over the hook, and pull this loop through the back stitch.This will connect the beginning and end of your round.

, To work in the camel stitch, begin by chaining two and then half double crochet. Continue to half-double crochet all the way around the circle. When your each the end of the round, use a slipstitch to connect the yarn back into the circle., For the third round, start by chaining two and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is the one behind the back loop. You can locate it by turning the stitches slightly. This stitch is called the third loop because it is the third stitch from the front. Continue to HDC into the third loop to the end of the round.Use a slipstitch to connect the end of the round with the beginning of the round.

, For the fourth round and each round after this one, chain two and then HDC to the end of the round. Finish each round with a slipstitch to connect the beginning and end of the round.Keep crocheting until you reach the desired length.

See the ""Tips"" section if you need instructions on forming slip knots or chain stitches.
You will use two yarn colors for this project: a base color and an accent color. For now, start with your base color.;
, For your first row, you will crochet up one side of the chain, then back down the other side. The top of the chain will be larger than the bottom and will eventually form the toe area of the sole.

Single crochet three times in the second chain away from the hook.

If you do not know how to single crochet, check the ""Tips"" section for instructions.

Join the first and last stitches of the row using one slip stitch.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3 to 4 inch (7.6 to 10 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to create a knot and secure the sole.

Weave the excess tail into the stitches along the wrong side of the sole to hide it from sight and hold it in place.
This step completes one sole.

, You will need to make three more soles using the same technique outlined for the first sole. One of these soles should use your base color. The other two should use your accent color., Place one base sole on top of one accent sole. Slip stitch the soles together through the center stitches at the back of the heels.

Use your accent color yarn to do this.
Note that your base color sole should be the top piece and your accent color sole should be on the bottom.
The wrong sides of the soles should face each other as you do this.

, Repeat all the way around the perimeter of the soles.

This should add a border to the soles while joining both layers together.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3 inch (7.6 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot it in place.

Weave the excess tail into the stitches of your bottom layer.

, Slip stitch the other two soles together at the back, then single crochet both layers together in each set of stitches around the perimeter. Fasten off the yarn as usual.

When finished, you should have two identical soles, each made with two layers.
Note that these two soles should be mirror images of each other, just like standard sandals would be.

, Examine your stitches at the back of the heel and find the center stitch. Count five stitches to the right of this stitch; this will be your starting point.

Note that you will be working into the trim you created when joining the soles together, so those are the stitches you need to count out in this step.
Also note that you should use your accent color when creating the back heel.

,

You will be working toward the center back of the heel at first. After your first five stitches, you will end up working past the center to its left.
This row of single stitches should be evenly centered along the back.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into each of the stitches of your original back heel row., Cut the yarn, leaving an 8 inch (20 cm) tail or so. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot the yarn.

The excess tail here will be used to help sew the pieces together later.

, Follow the same procedure outlined here to crochet a back heel onto your other sole., Work 7 chain stitches from your hook, then slip stitch the first and last together to form a ring.

Use your accent color yarn.
Note that this piece is worked separately from the rest of the sandal and will be joined to the body of the sandal later.

, For the first round, single crochet once into each of the stitches in your foundation ring.

Do not join the first and last stitches of the round together.

, You will need to make a total of 23 rounds. For each round, simply single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round.

Do not join the first and last stitches of any of the rounds together. You will use the ""continual round"" technique; in other words, the first stitch of the next round will be worked through the top loop of the first stitch from your current round. There are no ""in between"" steps to advance you to the next round.
The strap should curl up into a tube as you work.

, Fold the tube in half so that both open ends meet. Slip stitch the bottom four stitches together. Gradually work up the opening, slip stitching as you go, to close the tube and create a closed strap.

You will end up working through four sets of stitches.

, Cut the yarn, leaving an 8 inch (20 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot off the ankle strap.

This tail needs to remain long so that you can sew the ankle strap to the toe strap later.

, Position the ankle strap so that its tail is pointed toward the front of the sandal. Whip stitch the bottom loops of the ankle strap to the top loops of the back heel using your accent yarn.

You should whip stitch the pieces together using a yarn (tapestry) needle instead of a crochet hook.
Check the ""Tips"" section if you need instructions on whip stitching.

, Follow the same steps outlined above to make a second ankle strap. Whip stitch this second ankle strap to the back heel of the other sandal., Chain six using your accent color yarn, then join the last and first stitch together with a slip stitch to form a round.

This piece will also be worked separately from the rest of the sandal and joined later.
Leave an 8 inch (20 cm) starting tail when forming the slipknot attached to your crochet hook. This tail will be used to sew the strap to the sole later.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch of your foundation round to complete the first round.

You will do the same thing to form the next 10 rounds. Single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round.
Do not join the first and last stitches of each round together. Simply move from one round to the next without taking any extra steps to advance.
At the end of the very last round, slip stitch the first and last stitch of the round together.
As you crochet, a tube should form.

, Cut the yarn, leaving another 8 inch (20 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie a knot and secure the strap piece.

This tail should lie on the opposite end of your starting tail.
The long tail will help you sew the strap to the sole.

, Using a yarn needle and the tails on each side of the toe strap, whip stitch both ends of the ankle strap to the sole of the sandal, near the toe area.

Locate the center stitch at the front of the toe area. Count back five stitches from this center and attach the front of one strap end to this stitch. Sew the rest of the strap on, moving back toward the ankle strap as you work.
Count back five stitches from the center front of the sole on its opposite side. Sew the other side of the strap on in the same way you attached the first side.
Note that you should be sewing the open ends of the tube closed as you whip stitch the strap to the sole.

, Pinch the toe strap and ankle strap together at their natural centers. Use the tail of the ankle strap to whip stitch across four stitches in the center of the toe strap, joining the toe pieces together.

Knot the tail and weave it into the inside of either strap to help secure the stitching.

, Follow the same steps outlined here to create a second toe strap.

Attach this toe strap to the sole and ankle strap of the other sandal using the same procedure you used for the first.

, Weave in or cut away any excess tails you see. With this, the baby sandals should be complete and ready for use."

Understand that tension and gauge are the same.,
Be careful about stitches.,
Rewrite the pattern to 'translate' it.,
Take your time to avoid mistakes.",How to Understand the Difference Between American and British Crochet Terms," When reading a new pattern, crocheters familiar with American terms may be confused when reading a written pattern and seeing ""tension,"" while British crocheters will feel the same when they see ""gauge."" However, they actually are synonymous.;
, Various types of stitches have different names. In order to avoid mistakes, you need to know if your pattern is American or British. A simple way to handle the difference is to remember that British stitches are one step up from American stitches. An American single crochet identical to a British double crochet, which makes a British single crochet an American chain stitch.


Facing an entire written pattern with a terminology you're not familiar with can be daunting. The chart below will help you remember.







, As daunting as it may seem, if you need to translate from one terminology to another, the easiest way would be to rewrite the pattern for yourself. If it's not too daunting with rows and rows of different directions and repeats, it's easier to just sit down, rewrite it, and translate it yourself.


At the very least, you should be completely comfortable with the pattern before you even start. This makes for an easier and quicker project with a fewer chance of making mistakes.

, Translating on the fly can bend your brain in ways you never thought it could, and mistakes are easy to make if you're not careful. If you're not completely comfortable doing this, don't set yourself up for failure by trying to do more than you're comfortable with.

Success will come easily through practice, just as your comfort and speed with crocheting get better the more you do it.

Then, slide this loop onto the hook and pull the tail to tighten it. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull through to make your first chain. Loop the yarn over again and pull through to make your second chain.For a wider I-cord, you can chain more than two stitches, such as three, four, or five stitches.;
, You will be working into both of the chains you have created to make your I-cord. Slip the second chain onto the hook so that it is in front of your first chain. You should now have two loops on your hook.If you are making an I-cord out of a chain of three or more, then just slip the second chain on the hook for now.

, You will be chaining each of your loops separately in an alternating fashion to create your I-cord. Loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through your first chain to create the first new chain link.If you are creating an I-cord that is more than two chains, work on one chain at a time. For example, if you are making a chain of three, then you will need to chain into the second loop first and then slide the third chain onto the hook and chain into that loop.

, Next, grasp this new loop you have made and slide it off of the hook. Be careful not to pull on your yarn or the loop may come undone.If you are making an I-cord of more than two strands, then slip each loop off the hook as you create them and be careful not to pull on the loops.

, While one loop is off of the hook, loop the yarn over the hook and create a new chain with the loop that is still on the hook.If you are making a chain of three or more, then you will need to take this new loop that you made off of the hook as well and continue chaining your stitches one at a time until you reach the last one. Don’t take the last one off of the hook.

, For a two chain I-cord, you will just be slipping one chain on and off the hook and alternating which one you are working. If you are making a two chain I-cord, then you can slide your other loop back onto the hook and chain one. Then slide the loop back off and chain one into the other loop.If you are making a chain of three or more, then just slide one loop at a time back onto the hook and chain one for each loop. Then, slide all but one loop off again and repeat the process starting with the loop that is on the hook.

, When you have made your I-cord as long as you want it to be, chain one through all of the loops on the hook at the same time. Then, you can cut the tail and tie off the end to secure it.


Your I-cord should be finished and ready to use!

Use a half double crochet stitch to join the last stitch with the first.,
Continue to half double crochet.,
Slipstitch and tie off to finish.",How to Crochet an I Cord2," Start by making a chain of four stitches and then slipstitch to join the first and last chains into a ring. You will be working into the center of the ring to create your first round., To create the first round for your I-cord, you will need to work seven half double crochet stitches into the center of the chain ring.To do a half double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the center of the ring. Then, yarn over and pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook and yarn over again. Then, pull the yarn through all three loops to complete the stitch.Repeat six more times for a total of seven half double crochet stitches worked into the center of the ring.

, Instead of using a slipstitch to join your first and last stitches, use another half double crochet stitch to join your seventh half double crochet stitch with your first one. This will start a spiral pattern that will help to give your I-cord an interesting look.You will need to repeat this at the end of each round to continue the spiral pattern.

, After you have joined the round, continue to half double crochet into each of the stitches. Half double crochet for the entire round and then half double crochet to join.Repeat this for every round until your I-cord is the desired length.

, When you are done, slipstitch to join the last stitch in your round with the first. Then, cut he yarn a few inches from the loop and pull through to secure it. Tie it in a second knot to make sure it will stay put.Your I-cord is finished and ready to use!

Bind off stitches.",How to Tunisian Crochet the Crossed Stitch," You will need some yarn and a Tunisian crochet hook. In Tunisian crochet, you work the yarn onto the hook similar to how you would with knitting, but then you work the yarn off of the hook on your second pass. Most regular crochet hooks are too small to work in this way, so you will need a special Tunisian crochet hook.


You can use any size hook you like as long as it is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. If you are not following the hook and yarn recommendations of a pattern, make sure that you check the gauge before beginning a project.
If you do not have a Tunisian crochet hook, then you can try taking a regular crochet hook and wrapping a rubber band around the end. Just keep in mind that this will only work for a narrower project, such as a practice swatch, scarf, or washcloth.;
, Start by making a chain in the length that your pattern or project calls for. If you just want to practice the Tunisian crossed stitch, then start with a chain of 12 stitches.


Try starting with 30 stitches for a washcloth or scarf. You can work in the Tunisian crossed stitch until you have a square washcloth or keep going to make a scarf. Make sure to use cotton yarn if you decide to make a washcloth.

, Insert the hook into the first stitch on your chain and then loop the yarn over your hook. Pull the new yarn through the previous loop. Then, insert the needle into the next stitch and repeat.Remember that you will be working stitches onto your hook as you go. After each new stitch, you should have a new loop on your hook.
Keep crocheting and working stitches onto the hook to the end of the row.

, To close the stitches you have created and work them off of your hook, you will need to work backwards starting with the stitches nearest your hook. Begin to bind off your stitches by looping the yarn over the hook and pulling this new yarn through your first loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through two stitches.Continue to yarn over and pull through two stitches all the way to the end of the row. When you reach the end, you should only have one stitch left on your hook.

, Locate the vertical threads in your foundation chain and then count to the second stitch from the end. Insert your hook under this thread and then loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through. This will leave a new loop on your hook that is connected to the thread., To create the crossing effect for this stitch, double back and insert the hook into the thread you skipped. Loop your yarn over the hook and pull this new loop through. Now, you should have three loops on your hook.Repeat the process of skipping and returning all the way to the end of your foundation chain to complete the first row of Tunisian crossed stitch.

, After each new row, you will need to bind off the stitches that are on your hook. Start by looping the yarn over the hook and pulling it through the first stitch on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull this yarn through the next two loops.Keep yarning over and pulling through two loops until the end of the row.
There should be just one loop left on your hook when you reach the end.

Start a simple project.,
Show the child how to do the stitch you are using in your pattern.,
Allow them to try making the next stitch.,
Catch their mistakes and talk them through the solution.,
After the first stitch, some kids will give the project back to you.,
Keep trading it off between the two of you until they're comfortable with the basic stitch(es) you're teaching them, or you finish it and need to teach them how to tie off.

,
Show them how to start a project the same way you showed them how to do one stitch.,
Let them work on this project by themselves, only asking you for help if they need it.

,
Show them what the pattern looks like.,
Once they finish this project, ask them what they'd like to make next.,
Show them any new skills that this pattern might have.",How to Teach Kids to Crochet," It's easier to get the feel of how to hold and manipulate the hook if you don't have to worry about starting off or the flimsiness of a first row or round.


Granny squares are a good choice. They're not too repetitive, so they stay interesting, they end so quickly that it's easy to teach them the complete pattern, how to start, and how to tie off, and most of the granny square patterns are pretty easy to memorize.
Whatever pattern you pick, be sure you have a printed/photographed pattern for it, to teach them how to read it. It's great if you have symbol and written notation for the same pattern, but as long as you have one or the other you can just teach them that.
It's great to be able to show them on a project that you were actually working on, instead of creating a new one just to show them. This has the benefits of working on something that you want to finish (instead of something that'll sit around in a closet) and making the kid feel excited and useful.;
, Hold your project where they can see it, and slowly make two or three stitches.


This is where it's good to have a project where most of the stitches are the same.

, Help them hold the hook properly, and verbally coach them through the process.


They may not be able to hold the yarn, old the other side of the project, and make a stitch all at the same time. If so, hold the yarn in position for them, and if necessary hold one side of the project.

, Most stitches are simple enough that they'll be able to get the right number of wraps, and pull the yarn through the right number of loops, but there are a few common mistakes with technique, such as:


Not turning the hook when they're trying to bring it through the loops. After catching the yarn, many people don't realize that they have to turn the hook towards themselves in order to get it through the holes.
Holding everything too stiffly. Because it's a new skill, and a new way of moving their hands, they may be holding everything too stiffly. Not only is that not a particularly easy way to crochet, it's probably going to hurt in the long run.
Putting the hook through the wrong hole. Once they wrap the yarn around the hook (if necessary) and need to stick it into the top of a stitch in the row/round underneath, they may skip a stitch or put it in the same one they made the last stitch in. Show them how to tell where each stitch is, and if they've already put a stitch in it.
Making every stitch with different tension. Once they start going, you may notice that the whole project looks wavy. This is probably because they're adjusting their hands and tension after every stitch. Tell them what's wrong, and why consistent tension is important.

, Crochet a few more stitches (this will help balance out the new, erratic stitches they make) and offer it back to them.

,, If you've been teaching them on a project in the round, show them how to do a magic circle. If it's been in rows, show them a slipknot.

,, Tell them what all the symbols mean, and show them where to start and how to read the pattern.

, Help them find a simple pattern for it, pick out some yarn and hooks, and show them how to read this new pattern. If they can read it by themselves already, or with minimal help, that's the best way to learn, but others might need you to teach them again.


If you decided to teach them granny squares, and a pattern you're actually making, you can use the square they made for your own project (if it's not too shabby). Some kids might want to keep it, some might want to make more to actually make something, but others will just not care.

, Maybe this one's in rows instead of in the round, or has increases or decreases. Maybe they'll need to add on another ball of yarn, or they want to change colors.

Enjoy your finished product!",How to Tapestry Crochet," There are many designs for tapestry crochet available online but you can also just draw your own.Using graph or grid paper, create a simple two color design that uses only one color per square. It is best to start with a design that is not too intricate, perhaps using your second color sparingly.


If using a traditional crochet pattern, you will need to be able to read it. Look online for a key to abbreviations, such as the one on the craft yarn council website or see How to Read Crochet Patterns.
You can also use cross-stitch patterns as inspiration for your tapestry crochet pattern.;
, While any yarn will work for tapestry crochet, consider how you want the finished project to turn out when picking out your yarn. If you want a tight and thin final outcome, then you will want to use a smaller gauge yarn that does not have a lot of loft (fluffiness), for instance a fine or light worsted yarn. If you want a larger and looser finished product, use a thicker and fluffier yarn. The choice is all yours!


You will also need to acquire a crochet hook that complements your yarn size and the desired look of your finished project. For example, thin yarn should usually be crocheted with a relatively thin hook and thicker yarn should be crocheted with a thicker hook. However, if you are a skilled crocheter and you are going for a unique style on your project, pick whatever combination of yarn and hook you want.

, Follow the first line of your pattern.


If using a pattern drawn in a grid, each square on your pattern you should make one stitch, so make sure the number of stitches match the number of boxes.
If you need to refresh your knowledge of the basic crochet stitch, feel free to visit How to Crochet or How to Single Crochet and take some time to practice your stitches.

, Use a single crochet stitch into the space under both top loops of the foundation stitch you are attaching to. Crochet by inserting the hook, from front to back, into the space underneath the top loops instead of inserting the crochet hook into only one of the top loops. This removes the yarn line that is created when the hook is inserted into only one of the top loops. It also produces a tight, woven look.

, You will need to work in your second color of yarn at least a few inches before you wish to begin your tapestry crochet design.


Lay the end of Color 2 flat along the top edge of your piece, holding it in place with the hand you do not have the needle in.
Crochet the next several stitches as usual, with Color 2 remaining flat against the top of the row, inside your stitches.You should not be able to see Color 2 in your work at this point. This is considered hiding or carrying the unused color and has great benefits to your finished piece, including making it stronger and avoiding unsightly and bothersome pieces sticking out the backside of your work.
Some people work in the second color from the second row of their project. This makes sure that the thickness of your whole project is the same and that the second color will be sure to be there when you need it.

, Interrupt a single crochet stitch of Color 1. Do not complete the final single crochet stitch. With two loops of the single crochet remaining on your hook, drop Color 1 and carry it along, picking up Color 2 with your hook and pulling it through both prepared loops., As you make these stitches, Color 1 will be pulled along, concealed inside the stitches as you did for Color 2 previously.

, The process to revert back to Color 1 is the same as you used to switch to Color 2.


Drop and carry the yarn color you do not need for now if you want. Two loops of the single crochet should still be on your hook. The carried yarn will be laying flat across the rim of your work.
Pick up Color 1 with your hook, pulling the loop through the two that are on your hook.

, Make sure that the stitches you make match the boxes on your pattern.


It may be helpful to cross off rows as you complete them, in order to not lose track of where you are.

, You can just tie off the yarn at the end of your last row but there are a variety of stitches you could use to end your piece but a simple blanket stitch will do just fine.If you just want to tie off your project, cut your yarn off a few inches after your last stitch while your hook is still in the last loops. Pull the end through the loops and tie it into a knot. Then weave the end of the yarn into the last line of stitches with a yarn needle, hiding the end of the yarn from view.

, Stitch together any separate pieces, if your project has multiple parts and trim any stray ends of yarn. Remember that your tapestry crochet project may need special care if laundered, as each yarn requires specific handling.

Choose the mold for your bowl.,
Place your mold upside down on top of a foil-lined baking sheet.,
Place a sheet of plastic wrap over your mold.Not only will this keep it clean, but it will also make the doily easier to remove later on.,
Fill a small container with fabric stiffener.,
Consider adding a few drops of acrylic paint into the fabric stiffener.,

Use your fingers to smooth down the doily against the bottom and sides of your mold.,
Allow the doily to dry.,
Carefully lift the doily away.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Lace Doily Bowl," You can use an actual bowl, but you don't have to. Anything that is rounded, like a bowl, will work, including candy dishes and balloons! If you decide to work with a balloon, blow it up however big you want it to be, then set it down into a cup. The mold needs to be big enough so that doily doesn't hang over the edges when you place it on top.


Place a couple of dried beans, some dried rice, or a marble into the balloon before you blow it up. When you put it into the cup, the beans/rice/marbles will act as weights and help keep the balloon steady.;
, You can also work on top of a stack of newspapers, a paper bag, or a cheap tablecloth. This project can get messy, so you want to protect your work area.

, If you are using a bowl, consider tucking the edges underneath the bowl to keep them out of the way.

, You can use just about anything you want for this, although a disposable container, such as an old (but clean) yogurt container would work best. Other options include old mugs, old bowls, plastic food storage tubs, and metal baking tins.


Can't find any fabric stiffener? Try decoupage glue instead. You can also mix together equal parts of white school glue and water.Pay attention to the type of decoupage glue that you are buying. Many come in different finishes, such as matte, satin, or glossy. Choose one that appeals the most to you.

, This is not completely necessary, but it will give your bowl a pretty color. Give the mixture a good stir so that there aren't any streaks of paint.If you with to dye the doily, do not add paint to the fabric stiffener.
This works well on both colored and white doilies. Colored doilies may require more paint, however.

, This is very important. Unlike acrylic paint, dye is translucent. This means that the old color will show through. For example, if you try to dye a yellow doily blue, you will get green. If you try to dye a pink doily green, you will get a brownish color.


This section is optional. If you already added paint to your fabric stiffener, or if you want a white bowl, skip this section an move on to the next.

, You will be mixing up your dye in this container, so you want something that you can throw away if it gets damaged. If you don't have any disposable, plastic containers (such as yogurt tubs), you can use a glass container instead. Make sure that it is safe for food coloring.If you have fabric dye that you wish to use, you can use that instead. Follow the instructions on the packaging. The amounts for water may be different.

, Stir the water until the salt dissolves. How much fool coloring you add is up to you; the more you add, the deeper and darker your doily will turn out. The salt is there to help the doily absorb the color better., There are lots of ways you can do this, and each one will give you a slightly different effect. For example:


To get a solid color, dip the doily into the dye completely.
To get a tie dye effect, scrunch up the doily, and secure it with rubber bands. Dip it into the dye bath.
To get an ombre finish, pinch the doily by the middle, then dip just the edges into the dye. You can get a gradient effect by dipping it multiple times, deeper each time., The doily may take a while to dry. You can speed things up by letting it sit out in the hot sun, or drying it with a hair dryer. Once the doily is dry, you can move on to the next section. Don't get impatient; if you get the doily wet too soon, the dye may come off.

, This is where your project gets really messy. Use your fingers to press the doily into the fabric stiffener, making sure that it gets completely soaked.

, Take the doily out of the fabric stiffener, and squeeze it in your fist, allowing the excess stiffener to drip back into the container. Place the doily on top of your mold, making sure that it is centered.

, Make sure to smooth out any ripples or wrinkles, working from top to bottom in downward strokes. You may notice some excess fabric stiffener pooling around the base of your mold., It will take at least 24 hours for the doily to dry.Keep in mind that exact drying times will vary, depending on the products you are using as well as the temperature and humidity in your home.

, Don't worry if the plastic wrap comes out with the doily. Simply peel the plastic wrap away, and discard it. If the doily is still damp inside, set it down upright, and let it finish drying.

Cut and fasten off the yarn.",How to Tunisian Crochet," Attach the yarn to your hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation of 10 standard chain stitches.


You can change this number of chains according to your needs. This example uses 10 chain stitches, but you should alter this number based on your pattern's instructions or on the desired length of your work.
To make a slip knot:

Create a loop, passing the tail end of the yarn beneath the attached side.
Push the attached side of the yarn up through the bottom of the loop, creating a second loop in the process. Tighten the first loop around it.
Insert your crochet hook into the second loop. Pull on the tail end of the yarn to tighten the second loop onto the hook and complete the knot.


To make a standard chain stitch:

Yarn over the tip of the hook once.
Pull this yarn-over through the loop already on your hook. This completes one chain stitch.

;
, Yarn over the hook once, then pull a loop back through to the front of your piece.You can either work your stitches into the back loops of your foundation chain or into both the front and back loops. No matter which method you use, however, you should continue to use the same method throughout the entire work.
At the end of this step, you should have two loops on your hook.
Note that you are beginning your first forward pass. You are also creating a preparation row for the rest of your work.

, Follow the same technique to pull up a loop through each chain. Continue until you reach the end of your foundation chain.


For each chain, insert the hook into the chain, yarn over the tip, and draw the loop back through to the front of the stitch.
By the end of this process, you should have as many loops on your hook as you had stitches in your foundation chain. For this example, you will have 10 loops.
This completes your first forward pass.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook, then pull this yarn over through one loop on your hook.


You should still have the same number of loops on your hook as before. For this example, you will have 10 loops.
This is the first stitch in your return pass. The rest are similar, but not quite like it.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook again. This time, pull the yarn-over through two loops on your hook.


After this step, you will have one less loop on your hook. For this example, you should have nine loops.

, Repeat the previous step until you reach the start of your work and only have on loop left on your hook.


For each stitch, you should yarn over the hook and pull the yarn-over through two loops previously on the hook.
At the end of each stitch, you will be left with one less loop on your hook. For instance, eight loops after the next stitch, seven after the stitch that follows, six loops for the stitch after that, and so on.
Do not pull through the last loop on your hook.
This step completes your first reverse pass. It also completes your preparation row.

, To start another row of Tunisian crochet using the simple stitch, you will need to work another forward pass in the same basic manner as the first.


For this forward pass, insert the hook from right to left into the second vertical bar from the hook. Do not insert the hook into the vertical bar directly below it; you must use the second vertical bar.
Yarn over the tip of the hook and pull it back through to the front of the vertical bar. You should have two loops on your hook.
Insert the hook into the next vertical bar, yarn over, and pull it through, giving you three loops on your hook.
Repeat along the entire row, until you have reached the last vertical bar. Do not work a stitch into the last vertical bar yet.

, Locate the horizontal bar directly right of the last vertical bar. Insert the hook under this horizontal bar, as well as the last vertical bar. Yarn over and pull a loop back through these two stitches to complete your forward pass.


Note that this step is only optional. If desired, you can simply draw a loop up from beneath the vertical bar only and exclude the horizontal bar. Using both adds stability to your work, however.
At the end of this step, you should have 10 loops on your hook, or however many loops as you had in your foundation chain.

, Complete another return pass row in the same way as the first.


Yarn over the tip of the hook. Pull this yarn-over through one loop previously on your hook.
Yarn over the hook again, but this time, pull it through two loops on your hook. This should decrease the number of loops on your hook by one. Repeat this step across the rest of the row until there is only one loop left on your hook.

, Alternate back and forth between forward pass and reverse pass rows, ending at the conclusion of a reverse pass row, until you reach the end of your simple stitch section or the end of your overall work.


You can create an entire work using nothing but the Tunisian simple stitch. You could also combine the simple stitch with other techniques, though, like the Tunisian double crochet.
If you wish to end with only the Tunisian simple stitch, skip down to the section on ""Finishing the Work.""

, The Tunisian double crochet starts after you have completed a preparation row using the Tunisian simple stitch.


You can also work the Tunisian double crochet into larger piece of Tunisian simple stitches. The preparation row is a minimum start, but not a maximum start.
Make sure that you have completed a reverse pass before you start the Tunisian double crochet. There should only be one loop on your hook when you start.

, Work two standard chain stitches from the loop on your hook.


These chain stitches will help accommodate the eventual height of your Tunisian double crochet row.

, Yarn over the hook once, then insert it into the second vertical bar. Yarn over again, then draw this yarn-over back through to the front of your work, creating a loop. Yarn over once more, then draw your last yarn-over through two loops on your hook.Note that the first vertical bar should be skipped over, as done with the simple stitch.
Leave the final loop of the stitch on your hook. There should already be one loop on your hook from before that, however, giving you a total of two loops on the hook at the end of this first double crochet.
The difference between the Tunisian simple stitch and the Tunisian double crochet lies entirely in this forward pass part of the process.

, Repeat the previous step, working into each vertical stitch of the previous until you reach the end of that previous row.


For each stitch, yarn over the hook once, insert it into the next vertical bar, and yarn over again. Draw the yarn-over back through to the front, yarn over again, and draw this last yarn-over through two loops on your hook.
For the last vertical bar, insert the hook into the horizontal stitch lying to the right of the vertical bar as well as the vertical bar itself. When pulling a loop back through to the front of the work, make sure that you pull it through both bars again. This adds stability to the edge of the work.
When you reach the end of your forward pass row, you should have 10 loops on your hook, or the number of stitches you started with in your foundation chain.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook and draw that yarn-over through one loop previously on your hook.


Note that the reverse pass for the Tunisian double crochet is the exact same as the reverse pass for the Tunisian simple stitch.

, Yarn over the hook, then draw that yarn over through two loops on the hook.


You should be left with one less loop on your hook at the end of this step.
Repeat this step until only one loop remains on the hook.

, Alternate back and forth between the forward pass and reverse pass until you reach the end of your Tunisian double crochet section or the end of your work as a whole.


Always end with the conclusion of a reverse pass.
Skip down to the section on ""Finishing the Work"" if you are ready to tie off the work at the completion of this step.

, Work through a return row, using either the Tunisian simple stitch or Tunisian double crochet. Wait until only two loops remain on your hook., Attach the new color to the tip of your hook, then draw this new color through both loops already on your hook.


To attach the new yarn, tie it to the tip of your crochet hook with a standard slipknot.
When you finish this step, you should have one loop of your new color on your hook and none of the old color on your hook.

, Work your next forward row of Tunisian simple stitches or Tunisian double crochet as you usually would, using the new yarn color instead of the old.


Continue along with forward and reverse passes as usual until you have all you need for this color yarn. You can then change colors again, using the same technique, or finish off your work.

, Insert the yarn into the second vertical bar from the hook. Yarn over the hook, then pull the yarn-over through both loops on your hook.


You can finish your work when you reach the end of a reverse row and only have one loop left on your hook.
You should only be left with one loop on your hook at the end of this step.

, Continue slip stitching into each stitch along the top edge of your work until you reach the end of your row.


For each stitch, insert the hook into the next vertical bar, yarn over, and pull the yarn-over through both loops on your hook.

, Cut the yarn, leaving at least a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the last loop on your hook to fasten off the work.


For added security, weave the excess tail into the back of the work, hiding it from sight.
This should complete your Tunisian crochet project.

Fasten off the yarn.",How to Crochet with Fun Fur," Fun fur is a bulky weight yarn classified under weight category five. As such, the yarn is fairly thick and will create heavier, bulkier work.Fun fur comes in a variety of color options. You can find it in solid colors, striped colors, or patterned colors.
As for gauge, a 4-inch (10 cm) square of fun fur yarn will consist of 14 rows, each containing 12 single crochets, when you use a size K-10.5 (6.5 mm) hook.
Fun fur yarn is also called eyelash yarn, furrish yarn, fuzzy yarn, and boa yarn.;
, As a bulky yarn, fun fur should be worked using a larger size hook. The smallest hook you use should be size J-10 (6 mm), but you can use hooks as large as size P (15 mm).Larger hook sizes will produce larger stitches. Larger stitches will be easier to see. They will also prevent the final work from being too dense and heavy.
When following a pattern, it is best to use the hook size recommended in the pattern. When no hook size is mentioned, choose one within this range.

, Furry yarn can be used to create a wide range of projects. When starting out, it's best to find a crochet pattern that specifically calls for furry yarn instead of trying to adapt a pattern that calls for a different style of yarn.


Fun fur yarn is commonly used to create full scarves, hats, ad handbags. It can also be used to add a furry trim to sweaters, hats, boots, and gloves.
You can find fun fur patterns for things like pillows, wreaths, and stuffed animals, too.

, When you work stitches using fun fur yarn, try to keep them fairly loose and relaxed. Do not make the stitches too tight.


Loose stitches are easier to see and will create a lighter finished work.
In addition, the little pieces of ""fuzz"" coming off the strand are more likely to get tangled in your stitches if those stitches are tight. Loose stitches will help the project remain neat and tidy.

, No matter how skilled you are with standard worsted weight yarn, you should take your time and work more slowly when you're getting started with fun fur.


Going at a slow pace will prevent you from accidentally yanking the yarn and getting the pieces of fuzz tangled together.

, Regardless of whether or not you use stitch markers when you work with worsted weight yarn, you must use stitch markers when you use fun fur yarn. The rows and rounds can be too difficult to see otherwise.


For normal projects with normal yarns, you would usually place a stitch marker at the end of each round or row.
For fun fur projects, however, you should divide the round or row into quarters and place markers at the end of each quarter. Work one-quarter of the stitch count instructed for each row/round in between the stitch markers.
Using stitch markers more frequently can make it easier to keep an accurate count of your stitches.

, If you make a mistake and need to unravel some of your work, you need to do so slowly, working one stitch at a time.Unraveling the yarn too quickly will cause it to tangle.
Hold onto the previous stitch with one hand while unraveling the current stitch with your other hand.
If some of the previous stitches do get tangled as you unravel a current one, carefully wiggle the current stitch in the opposite direction. Doing so should loosen the partially unraveled stitch and free the trapped fibers of the other stitch.

, While not strictly necessary, it is strongly recommended that you work your first few fun fur projects using a light color fur.


Stitches created with light colors are easier to see than those created with dark colors.

, Work in an area that offers plenty of light and avoid working in shadows. The excess light should make it easier to view the stitches.


Bright light is especially important when you do need to work with darker colors.

, If you still have a hard time seeing the stitches as you work with fun fur, hold a strand of worsted weight yarn together with the fun fur as you crochet.For best results, use a lightweight worsted yarn.
You'll be crocheting stitches using both the fun fur and the worsted weight yarn. Because of this, you will need a larger hook than the one called for in the pattern. Increase the hook by one or two sizes.
The fibers of the furry yarn should mask the appearance of the worsted weight yarn beneath. Just in case, though, try to match the colors of the two yarns as closely as possible.

, When working one stitch into a previous stitch, work it into the back loops of that stitch without touching the front loops.


Doing this makes it easier to see where you are supposed to insert the hook.
This trick also allows you to count the number of rounds you've completed if you get lost. Turn the work inside out and count the number of excess rings. There should be one excess ring per completed round.
Note that this trick will work best if you are using a pattern that specifically instructs you to work in the back loops only, but you can still try it with patterns that instruct otherwise. Just be aware of the fact that the final work may look slightly different from the work pictured with the pattern instructions.

, Try working along the inside rim of the yarn strand when you crochet with fun fur. Doing so will keep the outside of the work fuzzy and will prevent you from needing to turn the work inside out before stuffing or finishing it.


Turn the piece so that the crochet hook is at the side opposite you. As you insert the hook, do so by sliding it from the middle toward the outside.
If crocheting in this method seems too difficult, you could still stick with your standard technique. Know that any single-sided work (hats, stuffed animals, etc.) will need to be turned right-side out before you finish it, though.

, For this pattern, you will need three to four balls of furry yarn in any color you choose.


A size J-10 (6 mm) crochet hook is recommended.
You will also need to large-eyed blunt yarn needle and scissors.

, Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot.


To make a slip knot:

Create a loop with the loose end of the yarn.
Pull yarn from the attached end of the ball through the loop, creating a second loop in the process.
Insert the hook into the second loop and tighten that second loop until it lies snug against the hook.



,


Note that the foundation row does not count as the first row.
To make a chain stitch:

Grab the attached side of the yarn with your hook.
Pull the yarn through the loop on your hook to complete the stitch.



, Work one double crochet into the fourth chain stitch currently from the hook.


This stitch starts the beginning of the first official row.
The three stitches you skipped will form an edge along this side of the work. This edge will count as one double crochet stitch when you do a final stitch count at the end of the row.
To double crochet:

Yarn over the hook.
Insert your hook into the stitch.
Yarn over the hook again.
Pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch.
Yarn over the hook again and draw this yarn-over through the first two loops on the hook.
Yarn over the hook once more and draw it through the last two loops on your hook, completing one double crochet stitch.



, Work one double crochet into each of the remaining stitches in the foundation chain.


You should be able to count 16 stitches at the end of this first row (including the three-chain stitch at the beginning of the row).

, Turn the work over to the other side and work a turning chain of three chain stitches.


This turning chain will count as the first double crochet stitch of the second row.

, Double crochet once into the top of each stitch in the first row.


Including the turning chain, you should count 16 stitches at the end of the second row.

, Continue working rows of double crochet in the same manner until the scarf reaches a length of 40 inches (101.5 cm), or the length you desire.


Turn the work over at the end of each row.
Make a turning chain of three chain stitches when beginning the next row.
Double crochet once into each stitch until you reach the end of the row.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.


Use a yarn needle to weave the remaining tail into the stitches along the underside of the scarf, thereby hiding and securing the end.

Contrasting colors work best for interlocking crochet, so make sure that you choose two colors that will pop next to each other, like green and pink or purple and yellow. Also, choose smooth yarn types for this project and avoid anything too fluffy.You will need:


Two different colors of yarn.
A size 8 crochet hook (or a hook that is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using).
A pair of scissors.;
, The number of links in your foundation chain will depend on how many squares you would like your finished interlocking crochet to have.Multiply the number of squares you want to create by 2 and then add 4. For example, if you want your interlocking crochet to have 6 squares, then you would multiply 6 by 2, which equals 12, and then add 4, which equals 16.
If you want larger squares, then multiply the total number of squares by 3 and then add 5.For example, if you wanted your interlocking crochet to have 5 squares, then you would multiple this by 3, which equals 15, and then add 5, which equals 20.

, Use the number you came up with as your guide and create the foundation chain for your first filet mesh piece. For example, if you came up with 16 for your number, then chain 16 stitches., To begin making the foundation chain into filet mesh, count 6 stitches from the loop on your hook. Then, insert your hook into this loop and crochet to create your first window.To make your first window larger, count 8 stitches from the end., Next, chain 1 stitch and then skip to the second stitch away from where you made your first one. Skipping a stitch on your foundation chain will make the second window.To make your windows larger, skip 2 stitches instead of 1., Next, loop the yarn you’re your hook and double crochet into the foundation chain.Continue to chain 1, skip 1, loop over, and double crochet until you reach the end. Keep making mesh squares following this pattern until you reach the end of your chain., The turning chain is what you will use to connect this piece to your second piece. Each of the filet mesh pieces you create will need a turning chain at the end. To create a turning chain, make a chain of 4 at the end of the piece and finish it by leaving a large loop. This will help to ensure that the chain does not come undone before you are ready to use it., For your second set of squares, use a different color and make the foundation mesh one square shorter than your first one.This will result in a pattern and allow the colors of the second filet mesh piece to show through the windows on your first filet mesh piece.

, The chains of four should be on the same side and the longer of the two filet mesh chains should be on top. Line them up so that the second color shows through the square in the first color. This will mean that the edges will not be aligned. Instead, the edge of the second color filet mesh chain will be about ¼” to ½” in from the edge of the first color chain., Take the long loop that you left on the end of your turning chain for the first (longer) filet mesh piece and loop it over your crochet hook. Pull the yarn until it is tight on the hook., To link the two piece, insert the hook in through the back of the second piece, but don’t go through the stitches. Just insert the hook through the window in the shorter filet mesh piece., Next, insert the hook through the chain on the longer filet mesh piece and do a double crochet. This double crochet stitch will lock the two pieces together by looping around the edge of the shorter piece., Keep inserting the yarn through the window of the shorter piece and double crocheting through the longer piece until you reach the end of the pieces. Keep the pieces aligned as you go.


If you want to interlock more filet mesh pieces, then follow the same strategy. To add the next piece, you would use the turning chain of the shorter piece and insert it in through the window of a long piece to connect it.

Chain 12 stitches.,
Skip the first chain and half double crochet to the end.,
Use tail end to sew the two ends together.",How to Make a Crochet Flower Ring1," Start by making a chain of 12 stitches. If you want the ring to be larger, then you can make the chain longer. Measure it around your finger to see what feels comfortable.To make the first chain, loop the yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, yarn over the hook once and pull through to continue making the chain.;
, Go to the second link in your chain and do a half double crochet stitch into that chain. Then, continue to half double crochet to the end of the chain.To do a half double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the first single crochet stitch. Then, yarn over and pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook and yarn over again. Then, pull the yarn through all three loops to complete the stitch., Secure the last stitch by cutting it a few inches from the tail and then pulling the tail through the stitch to form a knot. Thread the tail through a darning needle and then use the yarn to sew the ends together.You can do the same thing with your starting tail, or you can weave this end into the ring and tie it to secure it. Make sure that you do not weave the tail in too tightly or it may affect the fit of your ring.

Make a magic ring.,
Single crochet five times into center of ring.,
Chain one and join with a slipstitch.,
Do one half double crochet.,
Double crochet three times.,
Do a half double crochet again.,
Attach the flower to the band when you are finished.",How to Make a Crochet Flower Ring2," To make a magic ring, loop the yarn around your finger twice and then slide it off while retaining the ring shape. Then, slipstitch once around the ring to anchor it and hold the shape.To secure the ring, insert the hook into the center of the ring, then yarn over and pull through the circle. Then, loop the yarn over with the hook on the top side of the ring and pull the new loop through the one on the hook.

, To fill out your magic circle, you will need to single crochet into the center five times. After you finish the last single crochet stitch, gently pull the loose thread of the ring to close the circle and tighten the center.To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete a single crochet stitch., To connect the first and last single crochet stitches, chain one and then do a slipstitch into the first single crochet stitch.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the first single crochet stitch in the round chain with the last stitch you made still on the hook. Then, loop the yarn over and pull it through both loops., To start the first petal, do one half double crochet stitch into the same stitch that you just slipstitched into. This will create the upward slope of your fist petal., Next, double crochet three times to fill out the petal. This will make up the body of the petal.To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then push the hook through the same stitch as the half double crochet stitch and then loop the yarn over again. Pull through the first stitch, and then yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete one double crochet.Repeat twice more for a total of three double crochet stitches.

, Finish your fist petal with another half double crochet stitch. This will add a slight downward slope and curve to the petal.This will complete the first petal and you will need to repeat this process four more times for a total of five petals. When you complete the last petal, secure the last stitch to the first stitch in the round with a slipstitch. Then, cut the yarn a few inches from the last stitch and pull it through to secure it.

, After you have completed your flower, thread the tail through a darning needle and sew it to the band. You may sew it to the band so that it is centered, or at a slight angle. Tie the yarn in a knot around one of the band stitches to secure the flower and then cut the excess.


If desired, you can add a bead or sequin to the center of the flower to add a decorative touch.

Make a chain of 11.,
Work two half double crochet stitches into each stitch.,
Coil the strip into a rose shape.,
Attach the rose to the ring.",How to Make a Crochet Flower Ring3," To create a rose ring, you will need to start with a chain of 11 stitches. This will make a small crocheted rose. You can make the chain longer if you want to make a larger rose., Skip the first link in your chain, and then half double crochet twice into each stitch all the way to the end. You should have 20 half double crochet stitches when you reach the end of the row.Cut the tail a few inches from the last stitch and pull it through to secure it.

, Begin to coil the strip of half double crocheted stitches by rolling it starting at one end. It should begin to form a rose shape.When the rose is coiled up to your liking, thread the tail through a darning needle and sew through the bottom of the rose to secure the shape.

, Next, you will need to attach the rose to your ring band. To do this, thread the starting tail or an extra piece of yarn through a darning needle and then use this to sew the rose onto the ring band.After the rose is secured, tie the yarn through a stitch in the band to secure it and cut the excess.

Gather your materials.,
Anchor the yarn to the edge of your project.,
Single crochet around the edges.,
Use a special stitch if desired.,
Go around the border the desired number of times.",How to Crochet Wide Flat Tape Edging1," Crocheting a flat wide edge requires the same materials as normal crocheting. You will need:


Yarn in the color of your choice
Crochet hook. Make sure that the crochet hook is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Check the yarn label to find the recommended hook size.
Scissors;
, Unless, your yarn is already connected to the project, you will need to tie the yarn to the edge of your project to hold it in place. Insert the free end of the yarn through one of the edge stitches and then tie a knot. You may even want to make a double knot to ensure that the yarn holds.


Another option is to make a slipknot and then slipstitch around one of the stitches to connect it.Loop the yarn around your index and ring finger twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop to make a slipknot. Slide this onto your hook and tighten it. Then, insert the hook into the stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through the stitch and the slipknot.

, To make a simple flat edge around your project, you can single crochet all stitches. This will ensure that the edges will be flat and you can make the edge as wide as you like.


To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete a single crochet stitch., You can keep your edging simple with a single or double crochet stitch, or you can use a special stitch to add interest to your project. Some stitches you might consider for your edging include:


Popcorn stitch
Textured shell stitch
Box stitch
Cluster stitch

, The more rounds you do, the wider the edge will be. Keep crocheting until the border of your project has reached the desired width.


When you are finished, cut the end of your working yarn a few inches from the hook and tie off your last stitch to secure your work. Hide the tail by weaving it into the edge or by trimming it down.

Gather your materials.,
Make a chain of four and quadruple treble stitch into first chain.,
Chain one and single crochet under the quadruple treble stitch 10 times.,
Turn and chain one.,
Skip the first stitch and single crochet into the next five stitches.,
Loop the yarn over five times for another quadruple treble stitch.",How to Crochet Wide Flat Tape Edging2," Making lace tape edging requires some special materials. You will need:Thread in the color of your choice. Use a fingering thread that has the specifications 4 ply, 100% cotton, and 169m/50g. Check the package to find this information.
Crochet hook in size #4 (2 mm). This is the ideal size for working with the thread you will be using. Anything larger or smaller may not produce the desired results.
Scissors
Beads (optional). If you decide to include beads in your lace tape, make sure they have holes large enough to insert the hook through them.

, Start by chaining four stitches to create your foundation chain. Then, connect the first and last loop by yarning over five times and inserting the hook into the first chain. Then, yarn over and pull through the first stitch. Yarn over and pull through two stitches four times until only one loop remains on the hook.Your work should look like a loop with yarn coiled around one side of it at this point.

, For the next row, you will need to work into the space under the quadruple treble stitch. Single crochet into this space 10 times to complete the row., When you reach the end of the row, turn the work around and chain one stitch. This stitch will provide some slack for turning and help to prevent puckering., Skip the first single crochet stitch in the row and single crochet into the next five stitches one time. Do one single crochet stitch in each of the next five stitches., Finish the row with a quadruple treble stitch. Loop the yarn over the hook five times to start and then insert the hook into the last stitch in the row. Complete the quadruple treble stitch as usual.Before you insert the hook into the last stitch in the row, you can add a bead if desired. To do this, slide the bead onto the end of the hook, then insert the hook into the stitch at the end of the row, yarn over, and pull through the bead and first stitch on the hook. Then, complete the quadruple treble stitch as usual.
Return to the chain one and single crochet 10 times step and go through the sequence again. Continue to work the rows in this sequence until your lace tape is the length you want it to be.
When you reach the end of your work, trim the thread and tie off the end to secure it.

Chain 5 and slipstitch again.,
Create a new shell in the space of the 5ch loop.,
Repeat until you reach the end.",How to Crochet the Textured Shell Stitch," The number of stitches you chain must be a multiple of 8 plus 4 for this pattern to work properly. That is because each shell will require a total of six stitches. Try 36 stitches if you just want to practice the shell stitch, or count to 8 then count to 4 as you make the chain. Repeat the sequence of counting 8+4 until you reach the desired chain length., Skip past the first stitch next to your hook and instead, single crochet into the second stitch.To single crochet, push the hook through the stitch, and yarn over and pull the new loop through. Then, yarn over again and pull the new loop through both loops on the hook., After the single crochet, skip the next six stitches and then do a double crochet. After you finish the first double crochet, continue to double crochet eight more times into the same space for a total of nine double crochet stitches in the same loop.To double crochet, yarn over and then push the hook into the stitch and yarn over again. Pull the new loop through the second loop on your hook. Then, yarn over again and through the first two loops on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the remaining two loops. You should have one loop left on the hook when you are done., After you finish double crocheting nine stitches into one space, skip the next six stitches and then slipstitch into the corner of the shell to connect the yarn.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the stitch, yarn over, and then pull through., After the slipstitch, chain 5 new stitches and then slipstitch into the base of the chain to create a chain loop. You will work into the loop to create a new shell later on.Repeat the pattern of skipping six, double crocheting nine times into one space, skipping six, slipstitching into the corner of the shell, chaining 5, and slipstitching back into the chain.

, When you get to the last stitch in your row, finish it with a single crochet stitch.You should now have a row of shells equivalent to the number of 8 + 4 sequences you chained.


For example, if you chained 36, then that is equal to three 8 + 4 sequences and you should have three shells.

, To start the second row, begin by turning the stitches and chaining one. This will be your turning chain, which provides some slack to begin the new row., Next, locate the first stitch in the row (should also be a single crochet stitch) and single crochet into that stitch.This marks the beginning of your second row.

, To add texture to the shells you created in your last row, you will need to follow a pattern of sc, dc, and sc again. Work this pattern into every stitch on the edge of the shells. This means that you will be working three stitches into each of the nine stitches on the shell’s edge.Ensure that the loops of five chains stay in front of the shells as you work.

, After you reach the end of the row, single crochet again into the last single crochet stitch next to the last shell.This marks the end of your second row.

, To begin adding more shells for your third row, start by chaining 6. This will serve as the outer edge of the first new shell that you create in this row., Locate the first single crocheted stich and begin working double crochet stitches into this space. Double crochet into the space five times to create a new shell at the beginning of the row., Next, locate the fifth stitch in the next shell. This is the first shell that you created in your first row.Slipstitch into the fifth stitch on this shell to connect it with the new shell.

, Next, chain 5 new stitches and then slipstitch into the fifth stitch again. This will create a new chain loop, which you will use to create more new shells in your next odd row., After you connect the new five chain loop, begin working a new shell into the center of the 5 chain loop that you created on your first row. Double crochet into the center of this loop nine times., Continue to follow this pattern of slipstitching into 5th stitch of existing shells, chaining 5 stitches, slipstitching again, and working a new shell into the chains of 5 until you reach the end of the row.After you finish your third row, return to the texturizing steps from the second row and repeat these for your fourth row.

This chain sets the width of the neckline as it sits on the shoulder of the garment. Use 13 chain stitches for a sweater measuring 35 to 36 inches (89 to 91 cm) across the bust.
If you plan to adjust the bust size of this sweater, adjust the number of chains until the foundation row is roughly one-ninth of your total bust measurement plus three chains.;
, Double crochet once into the fourth chain from the hook, then double crochet once into each of the remaining chains across the row.Turn the work when you reach the end of the row.
Your stitch count should be three fewer than your foundation row, making this first row approximately one-ninth of your total bust measurement.

, Chain three, then double crochet once into each stitch across the row.

Turn the piece when you reach the end of the row.

, Repeat the pattern of the second row six more times (rows three through eight).

For each row:

Chain three.
Double crochet once into each stitch across the row.
Turn the work at the end of the row.



, For the ninth row, begin by chaining three. Double crochet once into the next stitch and twice into the stitch after that; repeat this pattern across the row.

Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three. Double crochet once into the next stitch and twice into the stitch after that; repeat across the row.

You should end with one double crochet in the last stitch.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three and double crochet once in the next stitch.

Double crochet twice in the next stitch, then once into each of the next two stitches; repeat across the row.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch around the entire piece.

Try to space the single crochets apart as evenly as possible.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.

Weave the excess tail into the stitches, hiding it from sight.

, Follow the same steps to produce another piece identical to the first.

You should have two triangular pieces. When the bottom rows are lined up point-to-point, they should form the v-neck of your sweater.

, Attach new yarn to the hook with a slip knot, then work a foundation of 43 chain stitches.

If you've adjusted other parts of this pattern, you'll need to adjust this foundation chain, as well. The length of the chain should match your shoulder span (measured shoulder to shoulder), plus three chains.

, Double crochet once into the fourth chain from the hook, then once into each remaining chain across the row.

Your total stitch count should be three less than your foundation row.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three, then double crochet once into each stitch across the row.

Turn at the end of the row.

, Complete five more rows (rows 3 through 7) by following the pattern used for your second row.

For each row: chain three, double crochet once into each stitch across, then turn the work.

, Chain three. Double crochet once in each of the next two stitches, then twice into the stitch after that; repeat across the row.

The row should end with two double crochet in the last stitch.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three. Double crochet once in each of the next two stitches, then twice into the stitch after that; repeat across the rest of the row., Work one single crochet into each stitch around the sides and top (foundation) of the piece, but not into the bottom (ninth) row.

Try to keep the stitches evenly spaced apart as you work around the piece.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.

Weave the remaining end into the stitches.

, Tie new yarn to the crochet hook with a slip knot, then work a foundation row of 63 chain stitches.

If you adjusted the size of the pattern, note that this foundation chain should also be adjusted. The chain should be double the length of the final row in one of your front neck pieces, plus an extra three chains.
Also note that you'll work two separate pieces for the body. This foundation is only for the front portion of the sweater body and should not be long enough to include the back.

, Work one double crochet into the fourth chain from the hook, then work one double crochet into each of the remaining stitches.

Your stitch could should be three less than your foundation chain, and the length should now be double the length of the final row in one front neck piece.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three. Work one double crochet into each stitch across the row.

Turn at the end of the row.

, Make as many rows as needed to create a sweater with your desired length. Each of these rows should be identical to the second row.

For each row: chain three, double crochet once into each stitch across, and turn the work.
For a sweater measuring 16 inches (40.5 cm) long, you'll need a total for 24 rows. Adjust the row count as desired, accounting for the height of the collar in your calculations.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.

Weave the remaining excess into the stitches to hide it and further secure the yarn.

, Follow the same steps to create another identical rectangle of crocheted fabric. This second piece will become the back body piece.

Everything about this second piece should match the first, including the stitches per row and the number of rows.

, Attach new yarn to the hook with a slip knot, then work a foundation row of 76 chain stitches.

This foundation row will determine the length of the sleeve. Adjust the number of chains so that the foundation row matches your desired sleeve length, plus three chains.

, Work one double crochet into the fourth chain from the hook, then once into each of the remaining stitches across the row.

This first row should have three fewer stitches than your foundation, and it should more accurately match your desired sleeve length.
Turn at the end of the row.

, Chain three, then work one double crochet into each of the stitches across the row.

Turn at the end of the row.

, Repeat the second row pattern for another 12 rows (rows 3 through 14).

Adjust the number of rows as needed. When the long sides (row lengths) are matches together, the opening should be wide enough for your arm to fit through.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to tie it off.

Weave the excess yarn into the stitches.

, Fold the newly created rectangle so that the foundation and final rows (long sides) meet. Whip stitch the long sides together using new yarn and a yarn needle.

The right sides of the sleeve should face one another as you stitch it closed.
Leave the short sides open.

, Follow the same procedure to create a second sleeve that is identical to the first.

Both the foundation row stitch count and number of rows must match.

, Lay the two front collar pieces on the front body piece. Whip stitch the pieces together with a yarn needle.

The bottom rows of the collar pieces should line up with the top row of the body piece. Make sure that the collar pieces form an open v-shape between them.
Keep the front sides facing as you stitch the pieces together.

, Place the back v-neck collar on top of the back body piece. Whip stitch the two pieces together using a yarn needle.

Keep the right sides facing. The bottom row of the collar piece should line up with the top row of the body piece.

, Lay the front portion on top of the back portion. Whip stitch around the sides and shoulders to sew them together.

Make sure that the neckline, bottom, and armholes remain open.
When stitching around the armholes, make sure that you leave enough open space for your arms to fit through.

, Line up each sleeve with its respective armhole. Whip stitch the top opening of the sleeve to the stitches around the armhole.

Both the sleeves and the sweater body should be right-sides in as you stitch them together.

, Once all of the pieces have been stitched together, you can turn the sweater right-side out.

The sweater is essentially finished at this point. You can wear it as it currently is, or you can add edging and other embellishments before wearing it.

, Attach new yarn to the crochet hook with a slip knot, then join the new yarn to the bottom opening of the sweater with a slip stitch.

Join the yarn to the bottom opening just beneath the side seam. Do not join it in the center of the front or back.

, Single crochet once into the first stitch. Chain five, and slip stitch into the bottom of the chain to create the picot.To create smaller picots, you could work a chain of 3 or 4 stitches, instead.

, Work four single crochet across the row, then create another picot into the last of those single crochet stitches.

If desired, you could space the picots together more closely by working only two or three single crochet stitches between them.

, Continue working additional picots around the rest of the bottom opening. When finished, fasten off the yarn and weave in the excess.

Use the same number of chains in each picot and keep the same number of single crochet in between separate picots.

, If desired, you can also add the picot edging to the openings of both sleeves, too.

Follow the same steps to complete the sleeve edging. You can vary the size and spacing of your picots for the sleeves so that they differ from those on the bottom opening, but use the same pattern for each sleeve.

Crochet into the second chain from the hook.,
Turn and chain 3.,
Skip a stitch and double crochet.,
Return to the stitch you skipped and double crochet.,
Continue to follow the pattern of skipping and returning.",How to Crochet the Criss Cross Stitch1," You can make your chain as long as you want it to be. Try making a short chain of 12 stitches for practice or make a longer chain for a scarf or blanket. Just make sure that you have an even number of stitches in your foundation chain.Always remember to check the gauge for the yarn and hook you are using. This will help to ensure that your finished product is the size you want it to be.;
, Count two chains from the hook (not counting the chain that is on the hook) and then single crochet into this stitch.

To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch, then loop the free end of the yarn over the hook and pull it through the stitch. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull this yarn through both of the loops on the hook.Continue to single crochet to the end of the row. Continue to single crochet every stitch to the end of the chain. When you are finished, you will have your foundation for the criss cross stitch.

, Once you reach the end of the first row, you will need to turn the stitches around and chain 3 new stitches.These stitches are called turning stitches. They will give you some slack to begin the new row., With the criss cross stitch, you will be crocheting one stitch ahead and then going back across the stitch you just made to crochet the one you skipped. Start by skipping over the first stitch in your row and crocheting into the second stitch instead.To double crochet, start by looping the free end of the yarn over your hook. Then, insert the hook into the stitch and loop the yarn over the hook again. After that pull the hook through the stitch and loop the yarn over again. Pull this new loop through the first two loops on your hook. Then, loop the yarn over the hook once more and pull it through the last two loops on the hook., After you have finished your first double crochet, you will need to go back to the stitch you skipped and double crochet into it.After you finish double crocheting into this stitch, you will have completed your first criss cross stitch., Work in the criss cross stitch all the way to the end of the first row and in all rows following this one. You can use this pattern for all of the rows in your project or you can alternate with a simpler stitch, like single or double crochet.Remember to turn and chain 3 at the beginning of each row.

Single crochet 15 times to reach next rosebud space and repeat process.",How to Crochet the Rosebud Stitch," To do the rosebud crochet pattern, you need to create a foundation that will hold all of the work. You will need to make a chain that is a multiple of 15, and then add 12 more chain stitches.For example, you could crochet a chain of 60 plus 12 for a total of 72 chains, or crochet a chain of 150 plus 12 for a total of 162. There will be one rosebud every 15 chains, so the larger the chain, the more rosebuds you will be able to fit onto it.
To make the first chain, loop the yarn over your hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop on your hook. Then, yarn over the hook once and pull through again to continue making the chain.;
, After you have created your chain, skip the first three links in the chain and then double crochet into the chain. Double crochet all the way to the end of your chain to complete the first row of your foundation.To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then insert the hook through the stitch and yarn over again. Pull through the first stitch, then yarn over again. Pull through the next two stitches, then yarn over again. Pull through the remaining two stitches to complete one double crochet stitch., When you reach the end of the row, turn your work around and chain one. This will serve as your turning chain to provide slack for the next row. Single crochet to the end of the row.To single crochet, insert the crochet hook into the stitch and then yarn over. Pull the yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete one single crochet stitch., Begin your next row the same way, but this time chain three. This is because you will be double crocheting the final row of your foundation. Skip the first stitch in the row and then double crochet to the end of the row.Keep in mind that after you complete your first row of rosebuds, you will need to repeat the foundation row steps to continue building your work.

, To begin your leaf row, turn and chain one as you normally would to begin a single crochet row. Then, single crochet into the first five stitches of the row.Make sure to switch your yarn before you begin the row. Since you are making leaves, a shade of green will work best for the leaf row.
To switch yarn, cut the old yarn a few inches away from the hook. Then, tie the new yarn to the old yarn. Make sure the knot is as close to the hook as possible.

, To begin making your first leaf, chain three and then insert your hook into one of the stitches from the first double crochet stitch row. Single crochet into this stitch to secure the chain across the foundation.You may want to angle the chain slightly to provide a nice slant to your leaves. Try anchoring the chain to a double crochet stitch that is one or two spaces ahead of where the chain started.

, To create a leaf, you will be working into the space between the chain and your foundation. The sequence of stitches you will use to create the leaf are as follows:One single crochet.
One half double crochet. To do a half double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the space between the chain and foundation. Then, yarn over and pull through the first loop on the hook. Yarn over again and then pull through all three loops to complete the stitch.Three double crochet stitches.
One half double crochet.
One single crochet.

, The second leaf should be about four stitches away from the first one, but it should start in the same row. Chain three and then bring the chain down and back towards the beginning of the row.Make sure that you angle this chain the same way that you did the first one. The tips of the chains should be angling out and away from each other.

, After you have completed your second leaf, single crochet along the row 15 times. Then, begin your next set of leaves.When you make the last set of leaves for the row, single crochet to the end of the row to finish it.

, Your rosebud row starts the same way as your leaf row. Start by turning the work, chaining one, and ten single crocheting to the end of the row.Make sure to switch over to your rosebud yarn before you begin this row. Some good options include pink, red, purple, yellow, and blue.
To switch the yarn, cut the old yarn a few inches away from the hook and then tie the new yarn to the old yarn as close to the hook as possible. You can use any color you like to make your rosebuds.

, To make rosebuds you will need to make a chain and then work into it. Chain 12 stitches to begin your first rosebud., Skip the first three chains that you made and then double crochet into the chain. Double crochet three times into each of the chains. You should be able to do this nine times before you reach the end of the chain., Next, make a chain of three and then slipstitch into the last chain in the row. This will create a small chain loop that you can roll the strip around to for your rosebud.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the chain with the last stitch you made still on the hook. Then, loop the yarn over and pull it through both loops., Begin by pressing the loop you made against the end of the strip. Then, start rolling the strip around the loop to form your rosebud. Keep it tight so that the rosebud will look neat., When you are happy with the shape of your rosebud, use a slipstitch to connect the layers of yarn together. Insert your hook through the bottom of the rosebud and then loop the yarn around the hook and pull through all of the layers., Next, you will need to anchor the rosebud onto your foundation. Chain one and then insert the hook through the bottom of the rosebud and through the foundation. Yarn over and pull through to connect the rosebud to the foundation.Make sure to situate the rosebud so that it is between your two leaves. You may have to rotate it slightly to get it into the center.

, To continue making rosebuds, single crochet along the edge of the work 15 times. Then, being a new rosebud. Keep making rosebuds until you are near the end of the row, and then single crochet to the end.


After you finish your rosebud row, return to the foundation rows to continue the stitch pattern. You can keep working the rosebud stitch until you are satisfied with the size of your project.

Start with a washcloth.,
Make a hat.,
Try a scarf.",How to Crochet the Criss Cross Stitch2," A washcloth is one of the quickest and easiest projects to crochet. All you need is a size H hook and some cotton yarn. Start with a chain of 26 to 36 stitches (depending on how large you want your washcloth to be) and then work the rows according to the basic criss cross stitch pattern. Continue to work in the criss cross stitch until the washcloth is a square.

If you like, you can even keep going and turn your criss cross washcloth into a hand towel.

, You can use the criss cross stitch to crochet a beanie. Start by making the crown for your hat and then transition into using the criss cross stitch for the remaining rows.

To make a crown for your hat, start by making a chain of 4. Then, insert the hook into the first loop to make the chain into a circle and begin to double crochet around the chain. You will need to double crochet 11 more times into the chain of four to complete one round. Slipstitch to connect the round.
For the next round, chain 3 and work a double crochet into the first stitch. Double crochet twice into each stitch for the entire round so that you are doubling the number of stitches (24 total at the end of the round). Slipstitch to connect the round.
Four round three, chain 3 and then double crochet into the first stitch. For the rest of the round, double crochet into every other stitch twice and double crochet into the other stitches once. At the end of the round you will have 36 stitches. Slipstitch to connect the round.
Repeat round three two more times to complete your crown.Then, you can begin working your rounds in the criss cross stitch until the hat is the size you want it to be.

, Making a scarf is a great option for turning your practice stitches into a wearable project. Start by making a chain that is long enough for a scarf and then work in the criss cross stitch until it reaches the width that you want it to be. You can make the scarf as wide or as narrow as you like.If you really like the way the stitch looks, then you can always keep going and turn it into a blanket.

Make the turning chain stitch.,
Decrease by one stitch at each end.,
Stop when your shawl is down to a point.,
Fasten off.",How to Crochet Shawls1," This will create the top end of the shawl (the wide end). Start with a slipknot (a yarn loop shaped similar to a pretzel) and slip this onto the shaft of your crochet hook. Wrap the yarn around the hook, holding it taut. Pull the hook carrying the wrapped strand of yarn through the loop on your hook.With your first chain stitch you now have one loop remaining on your hook.
Make sure that your stitches are the same size. If they're too tight, try relaxing your hands. If they're too loose, shorten the distance between the hand containing the yarn and the hand containing the hook.
You need to make the chain long enough to wrap around yourself, because this will determine how big the top end of the shawl is.;
, For a single crochet stitch you insert your hook beneath the front and the back loops of the second chain from the hook. Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front, catching it with the hook. Draw the hook through the two chain stitch loops. Wrap the yarn over hook back to front and then draw your yarn over both loops on back.


If you want to use the half double stitch: start at the fourth chain stitch from the hook. Yarn over, as usual, back to front. Slip your hook under both front and back loops of your third chain stitch from the hook. Yarn over the front of the hook, and catch the yarn with your hook. Draw your hook through the two chain stitch loops (leaving you with three loops on the hook). Yarn over the hook, back to front, of course, and draw your hook through all three of the loops.
If you want to use a double stitch: start at the fifth stitch of the foundation chain. Do the yarn over the hook from back to front. Slip the hook under the front and back loops of the fourth chain stitch. Yarn over the front of your hook and catch your yarn. Draw the hook through the two chain stitch loops, leaving you with three loops on the hook. Yarn over again, back to front. Slip your hook through the first two loops on the hook, leaving you with two loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook back to front and draw your hook through both loops.
For the treble stitch: yarn over the hook twice. Insert your hook under the front and back loops of the fifth chain stitch from your hook. Yarn over and draw the hook through, giving you for loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook, again, and draw through the first two loops, giving you three loops on the hook. Yarn over and draw the hook through the next two loops on the hook, giving you two loops on the hook. Yarn over, again, drawing through both loops on your hook.

, You have to make a chain stitch when you proceed to the next row. It's called chain and turn. Make your chain stitch while turn the piece from the right to the left.


Continue with the regular stitches until you reach the end the next row.

, You have to decrease the stitches on either side, so that your shawl tapers into a triangular shape. This means two stitch decreases per row, one on either side.When you decrease you need to skip the final step of your stitch, so that you leave the worked loops still on the hook. Work your next stitch as you would normally, with your previous stitch's loops on the hook. At the end of the second stitch you draw your yarn through all the loops of both the first and the second stitch to combine them.

, There should only be one last single crochet stitch. This is what you'll use to fasten off and secure the shawl.

, You need to secure your last stitch so that the rest don't come unraveled. Cut your yarn about 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) from the loop on the hook. Bring the yarn over the hook, drawing the yarn end all the way through the loop. Pull the tail (the yarn end) to tighten and secure your last stitch."

Repeat the process to make more shells.,
Cut and tie off the yarn when you are finished.",How to Crochet the Reverse Shell Stitch," The reverse shell stitch is a simple one to do, but you will need to have some basic crochet materials handy. You will need:


Yarn in the color and type of your choice. Make sure to choose a yarn that is smooth to ensure that the shells shapes will be recognizable. A fluffy yarn might result in shells that don’t really look like shells.
Crochet hook. Choose a crochet hook that is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. You can check the label to find this information.
A crochet project to add reverse shell edging to, such as a blanket, scarf, or hat.
Scissors;
, To start edging a project with the reverse shell pattern, you will need to attach the yarn you want to use to the outside of your project. Tie the yarn through a stitch near the corner of your project.You can use this edging pattern for just about any type of project. For example, you could add reverse shell edging to a blanket, scarf, hat, or sweater.
If you just want to practice reverse shell edging, then you can also make a chain of 12 or more stitches to practice on.

, Once your yarn is secured to the crochet project or you have made your practice chain, begin your first shell by making a chain of three.To make the first chain, loop the yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, yarn over the hook and pull through twice more to make the second and third chains., Next, you will need to double crochet into each of the next three stitches on the edge of your project or into the chain.To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then push the hook through the third stitch from the hook and loop the yarn over again. Pull through the first stitch, and then yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, then yarn over again. Pull through the remaining two stitches to complete your first double crochet.Repeat twice more in the next two stitches for a total of three double crochet stitches.

, After you finish the third double crochet stitch, chain three stitches. Then, turn your work over so you are looking at the back of the stitches you just made., Slipstitch to connect your chain of three to the top of the first chain of three you created. This will form a chain loop that you will be working into to create your first shell.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the stitch and then loop the yarn over and pull through both loops on the hook., Next, make a chain of one. Then, turn your work over again so that you are looking at the side you started out with., To finish the first shell, you will need to double crochet seven times into the chain loop that you created. Double crochet into the space in the loop, not into the chain itself.When you are finished, you will have your first shell!

, You can continue to make shells along the edges of your crochet project. Start by making a chain of three and then double crocheting into the next three stitches. Then, complete the rest of the steps to create a second shell.

, When you are done edging your project with the reverse shell stitch, then you can cut the tail of your yarn and pull it through the last loop to make a knot. Then, tie the yarn through the last stitch one or two more times to secure it. Cut the excess yarn near the knot.

Make your chain.,
Crochet along the chain using your stitch of choice.,
Crochet back and forth without increasing or decreasing your stitch.,
Fasten off.",How to Crochet Shawls2," You make a chain by creating a slipknot (a type of knot shaped like a pretzel). Slip this knot onto your crochet hook's shaft and wrap the yarn around the hook, pulling it taut. Slip the hook with the wrapped yarn through the loop on your hook, leaving you with one chain stitch on your loop and one completed chain stitch.


This is the top, wide edge of the shawl. Because it's rectangular, not triangular, you will need to keep the same number of stitches the whole way down.
Should be long enough to wrap around yourself, or around whoever you’re planning on giving it to.

, You want to make sure that all your stitches are the same size as you're crocheting. Use whatever stitch is easiest for you or that you think looks the coolest with a rectangular shawl.The double stitch is a good basic stitch: find the fifth stitch of your foundation chain. Yarn over the hook from back to front. Slip your under the front and back loops of the fourth chain stitch. Yarn over the front of your hook and catch the yarn. Draw your hook through the two chain stitch loops. This will leave you with three loops on the hook. Yarn over again, back to front. Slip your hook through the first two loops on the hook, leaving you with two loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook back to front and draw your hook through both loops.
Crochet with the checkerboard stitch: begin with the typical chain. Doing the double crochet, start in the third stitch from the hook. Chain three stitches. Skip your next three stitches. Double crochet each of the next three stitches. Repeat chaining three stitches and skipping three stitches. Always end with the double crochet as your last stitch. Chain three and then turn. Continue doing the double crochet stitch, skipping three, and chaining three until you need to fasten off.

, You need to keep the same rectangular shape as you work. If you do skip a stitch then you'll need to either frog your stitches up to that point (undo them) or simply incorporate the skipped stitch into your design.The best thing to do is count out your stitches when you're making the chain and then count them as you're working, because this way you'll be able to keep track of whether you've skipped any stitches.

, When you've gotten the shawl as big as you want it to be it's time to secure the last stitch. This way the shawl won't come unraveled. Cut the yarn 12 inches (30.5 centimeters) from the loop on your hook. Slip your yarn over the hook, drawing your yarn end through the loop.


Pull the tail of the yarn (the yarn end) in order to tighten the yarn and secure your stitches.

Add fringe.,
Add tassels.,
Make your own shawl pin.",How to Crochet Shawls3," Cut pieces of yarn to the same length. Decide how many strands of yarn you want to put together. Fold your pieces evenly. Insert your crochet hook into the first loop from the bottom up of the shawl.Take the pieces of folded yarn with your crochet hook and hook them through the loop.
Push the pieces of yarn through the loop created by folding the pieces in half. Pull taut.
Continue until you've added as much fringe as you want.

, Tassels look particularly good on triangular shawls, because you can add a thick one to each of the corners that hand down. Tassels are made in the same basic way as the fringe, only you add more pieces of yarn to each bundle.Cut the pieces of yarn for each tassel the same length. Fold them over evenly.
Insert your hook into the stitch where you want to place the tassel or fringe. Insert your hook into the middle of the folded-up lengths of yarn, as you would to a loop when you were crocheting.
Pull the pieces of yarn through the stitch. Wrap the other side of your yarn around your hook and pull it all through the loop. Tassel completed.

, Shawl pins are a great way to add a little character to your shawl. You can make them very easily from a dowel, some wire, and beads that you enjoy. You can even paint the dowel if you're feeling really creative!Cut a dowel about six inches long and drill a small hole in one end. Sharpen the other end in a pencil sharpener
Slip a wire, about eight to ten inches long, through the hole, and twist to form a loop large enough to move freely in the hole.
Thread beads onto each wire end until satisfied and then cut excess wire. Twist the wire into a tight loop.

, When you get to the end of the first row, chain two stitches and then turn the stitches around. This is called the turning chain and it is helpful for preventing puckering in your work. Do this before each new row., To do your first bullion stitch, loop the yarn around the hook seven times. Keep the yarn close together but do not wrap the yarn over other loops. The yarn should look similar to a spring coiled around the hook.You can wrap the yarn around your hook more than seven times to create a larger stitch.Try looping the yarn around 10 or more times to see the difference in size.

, Next, insert the hook into the next stitch in your row. Then, loop the yarn over the hook and pull this loop through the second loop on your hook. This new loop will go through all of the loops on the hook to make the first bullion stitch., Begin pulling the yarn through all of the loops on your hook. You do not have to pull through all the loops at once. Just pull through them one at a time. When you have pulled through all of the loops on the hook, you have completed your first bullion stitch.You can follow the bullion stitch with another bullion stitch, or alternate between bullion stitches and single crochet stitches. Continue to do bullion stitches or alternate between bullion stitches and single crochet stitches to the end of the row.

, To provide stitches to work into for your next round of bullion stitches, you may want to follow each row of bullion stitches with a row of single crochet stitches. Then, do another row of bullion stitches for the following row.Remember to chain two for the turning chain at the beginning of every row.

, When you have finished your project or have gotten enough practice, snip the tail leaving enough yarn to pull through and make a secure knot. Then, pull the free end of the yarn through the loop and tug to tighten your final stitch into a knot. You may even want to knot it again to ensure that it is secure. Then, snip the excess yarn.

, The bullion stitch looks good with many different types of yarn, but some types of yarn may unravel slightly as you loop them around and around the hook. Therefore, a yarn that will not unravel may be a good choice. Experiment with different types of yarn to see which ones look best with the bullion stitch.


Remember to check the label of the yarn to find out what kind of hook will work best with it. There should be a crochet hook size recommendation on the yarn label.

, The bullion stitch may take some time to master, so be sure to go slow, especially at first. Count the loops as you ravel them around the hook and be careful as you pull the yarn through each loop. Also, keep in mind that going slow is helpful for any crochet project or new stitch.Don’t try to pull through all of the loops at once. It may seem like a good idea, but it is unlikely to yield good results.

, Tension is important when you are working the bullion stitch and in other crochet stitches.You may easily apply too much tension to one loop and not enough tension to another loop, and this could lead to a sloppy stitch. Try to ensure that each loop has roughly the same tension, and adjust as needed.


If you do end up with some inconsistent tension, then you can try to adjust the loops after they have been taken off the hook. Just gently tug at the loops to even them out.

Tightly tie off the loose ends.",How to Crochet Roses," Are you just making roses for practice or would you like to affix them to another item? For example, think about if you'd like to attach roses to a scarf, jacket, blanket, or hat. You'll need to decide how large you'd like your roses and how many you intend to make.;
, A worsted weight yarn is ideal for starting, since you'll be able to see the stitches. Consider how you'll be using the roses. If they're embellishing a scarf or purse, you may want a specialty yarn. Make sure the texture of the yarn matches the texture of the item you'll be attaching it to.

, This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen. The yarn package should give a suggested hook size for use with that specific yarn.Many worsted weight yarns will work with a number 5 hook or size I. The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose.

, Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook., Remember not to count your first stitch towards the 60 chains.


To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain., Add 3 chains onto the 60 that you already have. This will maintain the height when you start crocheting the following rows.

, This will effectively count as turning your work, so just continue crocheting the row.


To double chain, insert your hook into the fourth chain. Yarn over and pull the yarn through the chain. At this point, you should have three loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull through two loops on your hook. You should now have one loop on your hook., Make sure to insert your hook into the chain and not the gap closer to your hook.


To double crochet into your chain, insert your hook and yarn over. Pull up a loop, yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two. Continue doing this across the length of the chain., Check to make sure you have 60 stitches once you complete the row.

, Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row.

, Repeat this all the way across.


To double crochet, yarn over insert your hook under both of your loops, yarn over, and pull up. You should now have three loops on your hook. Yarn over, pull through two, yarn over and pull through two.

, Repeat this all the way across.


To single crochet, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches.

,, Cut the working yarn, then wrap the tail around your hook and pull it completely through your loop.

, Wrap and roll your scalloped piece so the scalloped edges face out like petals. Make sure to keep the straight edges lined up as you roll since you'll need to secure them later.


Wrapping the scalloped piece tightly will create a smaller ruffled rose, as compared to one that's looser and larger. Play with wrapping until you create a shape you like.

, Thread a darning or embroidery needle using the tail from your scalloped piece. Insert your needle into the next row over. Pull through to tighten the end of your scalloped piece.

, Using your threaded needle, continue working back and forth through the bottom or base of the row. Make sure to pass through all of the rose's layers.


Keep working the thread back and forth until the rose feels secure.

, Trim the remaining thread and use your rose.

Try on your finished slippers.",How to Crochet Slippers," This pattern, as described, will fit most women with an average foot size. You can adjust the width and length of the slipper as needed, though, creating a bigger or smaller slipper for any man, woman, or child.


Using a tape measure, measure one foot from the back of your heel to the tip of your big toe. Mark this down as the length measurement.If you typically need ""wide width"" shoes, you may also want to measure the widest part of your foot so that you can adjust the slippers accordingly. For most people, however, a width measurement is not needed.;
, Choose a heavy yarn with a tight twist. One with nylon or similarly strong fibers blended in will make an even better option.Slippers can get worn out easily, so a strong yarn is necessary.
The yarn should also feel soft, though, since you'll want to be comfortable when you wear the slippers.
Any color will work, of course, so feel free to choose any color that appeals to you.

, Make five chain stitches, then join the last stitch to the first using a slip stitch. This will create a small ring.


Use a slipknot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook before you start. To make a slip knot:

Form a loop by crossing the attached end of the yarn over the loose end.
Grab the attached side and pull it up through the loop, creating a second loop.
Pull to tighten the first loop around the second.
Insert the hook into the second loop. Tighten that second loop onto the hook.


To make a chain stitch:

Wrap the attached side of the yarn around the tip of the hook.
Pull this yarn-over through the loop on your hook.


To make a slip stitch:

Insert the hook into the designated stitch.
Wrap the yarn over the hook once.
Pull the yarn-over through all the loops on your hook and back through to the front of the stitch.



, Chain stitch three times, then work seven double crochets into the center of your foundation ring.


Your initial chain-three will count as the first double crochet in this step.
Slip stitch the last double crochet to the first (i.e., the chain-three) using a slip stitch.
To double crochet:

Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook into the designated stitch.
Yarn over the hook and pull it back through to the front of the stitch.
Yarn over the hook again, then draw the yarn through the first two loops on the hook.
Yarn over the hook once more, and draw it through the last two loops on the hook.



, Chain three again, then work one double crochet into the first stitch of your previous round. Work two double crochets into each stitch after that until you reach the end of the round.


As before, your initial chain-three counts as your first double crochet stitch.
Join the last and first stitch of this round together with a slip stitch.

, Chain three again, then double crochet once into the first stitch. As before, work two double crochets into each of the stitches after that until you reach the end of the round.


Note that you should not join the round with a slip stitch in this step. From this point on, you will crochet in a continuous spiral, starting one round directly after ending the one before it.

, For your next round, work one double crochet into each stitch of the previous round. Repeat this pattern until you have made a total of nine rounds like this.


Do not slip stitch any of the rounds together.
If you need to make the toe portion of the slipper larger or smaller based on the width or length of your foot, now is the time to do so. This portion of the slipper should completely cover your toes. Add or subtract rows as needed to produce the right dimensions.
Do not worry about altering the width of the rounds, even if you have a wide foot. You should be able to compensate for a larger width simply by creating additional rounds.

, Place what you have so far over the top of your foot. Your toes should be completely covered. If they aren't covered, make additional rounds using the instructions provided in the previous step until you do have enough material to cover your toes.


Do not cut or fasten off the yarn yet. The bottom half of the slipper will be worked directly from the top half; the two are not separate pieces.

, Turn the work over to the other side, then chain three. Work one double crochet into the second stitch from the hook. After that, work one double crochet into each of the next 20 stitches.


Do not double crochet all the way around the top of the slipper. From this point on, you will work in rows instead of full rounds.
This portion of the slipper should be just a little longer than the width of your foot so that it can cover the bottom and sides of your foot without covering the top.
Completing 20 double crochets should work for most feet, but you may need to add one or two if you have a wider foot. Compare your width measurement to the length of this row and adjust accordingly.

, Turn the work again, then make another chain of three stitches. Work one double crochet into the second stitch from the hook, then work one double crochet into each of the stitches from your previous row.

, For an average adult woman's slipper, you will need to make another six rows using the same procedure described in the previous step.


If you need to make the slipper longer or shorter, do so now by changing the number of rows created in this step. You need enough rows to reach the narrowest part of your arch, right before the heel begins flaring out.

, Turn the work, then chain three. Double crochet once in the first stitch from the hook, then continue making one double crochet in each stitch from the previous row. In the stitch of the row, work a second double crochet.


At this point, you are beginning to form and widen the slipper so that it can come up and over the heel of the foot.

, Turn the work, then start the next row by chaining three. Double crochet once into the second stitch from the hook, then once into each stitch from the previous row. Double crochet a second time into the last stitch of the row.


You will need to repeat this step to complete another two rows. Instead of double crocheting twice into the last stitch for these second two rows, however, you only need to double crochet once into the last stitch.

, Turn the work and chain three. Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook, then once into each of the remaining stitches in the row. Double crochet a second time into the last stitch of the row.

, Turn and chain three. Double crochet once into the second stitch from the hook and into every stitch after that until you reach the end of the row. Double crochet a second time in the last stitch of the row.


Repeat this step once more. For this second row, however, only double crochet once into the last stitch, not twice.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 10-inch (25.4-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot and secure the yarn in place.

, Thread the yarn tail through the eye of a yarn needle. Fold the back end of the slipper in half, bringing one back corner to the other back corner, then whipstitch the two halves together.


When stitching, make sure that the seam will lie on the inside of the slipper.
After sewing the end, knot the yarn and weave the excess tail into the inner portion of the slipper.
To whipstitch:

Insert the threaded yarn needle through the front and back loops of the edge not attached to the tail.
Draw the needle through the next set of front and back loops on the edge of your attached end, then immediately draw it through the next set of front and back loops on the edge of your unattached end. This completes one stitch.
Repeat as needed until you reach the end of the two edges.



, The right and left slippers are identical when you use this pattern, so you will need to make the second slipper by following the exact same instructions used when working the first slipper.

, The sole of your slippers will endure more friction than anything else, so adding a separate sole can strengthen your slippers and further their lifespan. A sole will also make your slippers non-stick.Consider buying pre-made slipper soles and attaching them to your slippers with strong fabric glue.
Alternatively, you could cut soles out of felt, leather, or indoor rug pads and glue them onto your slippers.
Consider brushing on multiple coats of liquid non-skid rug backing to the bottom of your slippers.
Lastly, consider adding dots of liquid rubber coating, fabric paint, or silicone sealant to the bottom of your slippers to make them non-stick.

, You can use these slippers as they are, but if you want to personalize them, consider adding a decorative touch.


For example, you could add a decorative trim around the opening of each slipper using a second yarn color. The simplest way to do this is to single stitch into each gap around the edge of each slipper opening.
You could also crochet a fun shape or separate decoration and sew it onto your finished slippers using a yarn needle. Ideas worth considering include crochet stars, crochet hearts, and crochet flowers.

, Your slippers should be done and ready to wear at this point. Slip them on and enjoy.

To create a magic ring, loop the yarn around your fingers twice, and then slide this ring of yarn off of your fingers. Begin to single crochet into the center of the ring and around the edges. Crochet five stitches and then pull the loose thread to bring the stitches together and close the circle. Slipstitch to connect the last stitch to the first stitch.Another option for creating a ring is to make a chain of four stitches and then connect the ends into a ring. Then, single crochet around the ring by inserting the hook in through the center of the ring. However, this method will result in a gap in the center of your pansy.;
, To continue your pansy, you will need to crochet six stitches around the magic circle. Insert your needle in through the center of the circle and crochet around the edge, not through the stitches.To single crochet, insert the hook through the stitch, then yarn over, pull the yarn through the stitch, yarn over again, and then pull the yarn through both stitches., For your next round, you will be alternating between two single crochet and one single crochet stitch all the way around. Start by crocheting twice into the first stitch, and then single crochet once into the next stitch. Repeat this pattern for the whole round.At the end of the round, you should have nine stitches in total.

, Pansies have two large petals and two smaller petals. To start your large petals, chain two stitches and then double crochet three times into the same stitch.To double crochet, yarn over, insert the hook through the stitch, yarn over again, and pull the yarn through the first loop. Then, yarn over, pull the yarn through the first two loops, yarn over again, and then pull through the last two loops., For the next two stitches, you will also be double crocheting three times into each one. This will begin to increase the width and build the petals., To finish your first of the two large petals, chain two stitches and then slipstitch into the circle again.This will complete your first petal. Repeat the sequence again to make the second larger petal.

, After you complete your second of the two large petals, slipstitch over to the next single crochet stitch. Then, chain two stitches., Next, double crochet into the first stitch twice to begin building up the petal. This one will be smaller than your first two, so you will only need to double crochet twice into the stitch., For the next stitch, double crochet three times into the same stitch. This will be the central part of the smaller peal., Finish the smaller petal with two double crochet stitches into the same stitch. Then, slipstitch to finish the petal.Repeat the sequence again to make the second smaller petal.
Cut the yarn and tie off the end to finish the flower.

, To enhance your pansies, you can double crochet around the edges with a contrasting color to make a pretty border. For example, if you made your petals yellow, then you could add a purple border to your pansy petals.


Adding a border will also make your pansies appear larger.

, If you want your pansy to have a central accent, then try sewing a button into the center of your pansy flower after it is finished. Choose a small decorative button that will look like the center of a flower.


Another option is to stitch a contrasting color into the center of the flower., Some pansies have streaks extending from their centers, and you can simulate this with yarn. Try stitching a few streaks of yarn outwards from the center of your flowers.Use a darning needle and yarn or thick thread to make these streaks. Choose a yarn or thread in a dark color, such as black, dark blue, or dark green.

, If you want to enhance the flowery appearance of your crocheted pansies even more, then you can also try adding some leaves to them. To crochet a simple leaf, make a chain of three stitches, and then single crochet across the chain. For the next row, increase by double crocheting twice into the first and last stitches of the row. Repeat this until the leaf is the desired width, and then decrease by double crocheting two stitches together on each end of the row until the leaf ends in a point.

",How to Crochet Leg Warmers," While you should choose a color you'll want to wear, you should also keep texture in mind. Make sure the yarn is comfortable and easy to work. Buy several skeins of yarn that all have the same dye lot or you might notice subtle color variations between the skeins.


Remember that the thicker the yarn, the warmer the leg warmers will be. You can certainly use thinner yarn, just be aware that they won't be as cozy as the ones made with bulkier yarn.;
, This is basically determined by the type of yarn you've chosen. The yarn package should give a suggested hook size for use with that specific yarn.


The hook size suggestion doesn't have to be followed, but your crocheting might turn out knotty or too loose.

, These are usually about 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches (10.2 cm) and feature the same stitches you'll be using in the pattern itself. If you're holding the yarn too tightly, you may need to increase your hook size. Likewise, if your stitches are too loose, a smaller hook may be needed.

, Note where you'd like them to fit on your leg, then measure that length. You'll essentially be crocheting one large rectangle before joining it together. The longest part of that rectangle should match the length you'd like for your leg warmers.

, Make a loop about 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the free end of the yarn. The free end should hang behind your loop. Insert your crochet hook through the loop and hook the free end before pulling it back through the loop and onto the hook., You can do more or fewer stitches in order to end up with a length of chain as long as you'd like your leg warmers to be. For an adult leg warmer, you'll probably create a chain about 11–15 inches (27.9–38.1 cm) long. Write down the number of chain stitches so you can make the next leg warmer the same length.


To make one chain stitch, you'll want to hold the hook in you right hand and loop the working yarn over your left index finger. Hold the end of the slipknot between the thumb and middle finger of your left hand. Then, bring the yarn from back to front around the shaft of the hook, drawing it through the loop on the hook. Repeat this to make the first row, or foundation chain., Do this for 10 stitches. You can then place a stitch marker, if you want a visual cue alerting you to single crochet.


To make a single crochet stitch, insert your hook from front to back in the center of the second chain from the hook. At this point, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over, or twist the yarn from front to back around the hook, and pull the yarn through the chain. Again, you should have 2 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and draw through the 2 loops. You'll now have single crochet stitches.

,


Turning your work simply means rotating it so that the last stitch you worked becomes the beginning of the next row.

,


To half-double crochet, yarn over your hook once and skip the first 2 stitches on your row. Insert your hook into the center of the third stitch. Yarn over one and then pull all 3 stitches through the chain. You'll have 3 loops on your hook. Yarn over again and pull the 3 stitches on your hook., Remember that chain 1 doesn't count as a stitch when in single crochet.,,,, Continue working across into the back loops, repeating till you get to your desired length.

, You'll know it's time to stop when the leg warmer is wide enough to fit around your leg. After the last stitch of the row, cut the yarn, leaving an 11–15 inch (27.9–38.1 cm) end. Bring the hook straight up and pull the cut end of the yarn completely through the stitch., You should be using a whip stitch to join them, going through each stitch from the front to the back and repeating all the way down the leg warmer.,"
"
Crochet a small piece to determine your gauge.,
Measure the length of your window.,
Use any number of dc for a sample piece.,
Know how many stitches you need for each row.,
For the curtains in this pattern, we started with ch 171.,
Hang your curtains.",How to Crochet Curtains," Here is a suggestion on how to do that. Chain 14, then make 1 dc in the fourth chain from your hook (this counts as the first dc), 1 dc in each of the next 9 chains. Do a few row of 10 dc. Measure the length of your 10 dc row. Remember, length means from the first dc to the last dc of the row as these curtains are worked lengthwise.;
, Take the length of your window and divide it by the length of your 10 dc row. Take that number and multiply it by 10 (which is the number of dc you had in your sample piece) to get the the number of dc you need for your curtains.

, This pattern used 10 dc as an example only. If you used 5 dc and it measured 2 inches (5.1 cm) and the length of your window is 40 inches (101.6 cm). You would divide 40 inches (101.6 cm) by 2 inches (5.1 cm) to get 20, then multiply 20 by 5 dc which tells you that you need 100 dc.

, But you need to add 1 more as it needs to end on an uneven number to make the edges works out right. Then you need to add 3 more for the starting chain which counts as the first dc. So take the number you got above and add 4 more to that, this is the number of stitches you need for your starting chain.

, But this may not work for you as your window may be a different size (the width of the window that these curtains were made for was 37 inches from the top of the trim to the bottom of the trim with the curtain width extended a few inches below the bottom trim board) and your gauge may be different than here, as you may crochet tighter or looser. So it is best to check your gauge before beginning.


First row: 1 dc in the fourth chain from hook (this counts as first dc). 1 dc in each ch to end of row, turn.
Rows 2 to 7: Ch 2 (counts as first dc, here I experimented with ch 2 and ch 3, but the ch 2 looked better. Just don't do it too tightly). 1 dc in next 3 sts, ch 1, skip next st, *1 dc in next st. ch 1, skip next st*, repeat from * to * to the last 4 stitches, 1 dc in the last 4 stitches, turn. This gives your curtains a ""mesh"" look.
Row 8: 1 dc in each st to end of row, turn.
Repeat 7 rows of ""mesh"" and 1 row of all dc until the desired width.

, If you have the round type curtain rod, you can weave the rod through the top meshes of the curtains below the 4 dc on each row. If you don't have the round type rod, add more to the length of your curtains so you can fold them over at the top and sew to make the sleeve for the curtain rod to slip through."

Repeat as needed.,
Fasten off the thread.",How to Crochet Lace1," Attach crochet thread to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work up 21 chain stitches.


Check the ""Tips"" section for information on making slip knots and chain stitches.
You can vary the length of this foundation chain, but make sure that your chains equal a number divisible by your intended groupings plus one. A standard grouping will be five stitches, so your chain count should be a multiple of five plus one extra: 21, 26, 31, 36, etc.
The extra chain will be your turning chain. You won't work into it, so in essence, it only exists to make the edge of the lace look smoother.
Crochet thread will give your lace a light, delicate appearance. If you want to crochet thicker lace, though, you can use a lightweight or worsted weight yarn instead of thread. Keep in mind that a heavier yarn will require a larger crochet hook, as well.;
, Insert the hook into the second chain from the hook, wrap the yarn over the hook, and draw the loop back through to the front of the stitch. Slide the tip of a knitting needle or dowel into this loop.


The size of your knitting needle or dowel will determine how large your loops are and how big your rows will be. A larger circumference will create bigger lace rows.

, Draw up loose loops in the remaining 19 stitches of your foundation chain. Slide the needle across the chain and into each loop, gathering all 20 loops onto the handle of the needle at the same time.


For each stitch, insert the hook into stitch, yarn over it, and draw a loop up through to the front. Insert the knitting needle into that loop before moving onto the next stitch.

, Slide your crochet needle underneath the first five loops. Make one chain stitch through the top of this grouping to close it.


You can either remove the knitting needle as you work on your groupings or keep it in. Do whichever option feels easiest for you.

, Work five single crochets into the middle of all five loops in your grouping.


See the ""Tips"" section for instructions on single crocheting.
Note that the number of single crochets you make will depend on the number of loops in your grouping. Five loops in your grouping means five single crochets; four loops in your grouping would mean four single crochets, and so on.
This step completes your first grouping.

, Insert your hook through the next five loops, chain one, then single crochet through the centers five times.


Continue this step until you have created groupings for all of your original loops across the row.
For a set of 20 loops, you will have four groupings.

, The single crochets you worked up in your first row will provide the base for your second row. Draw up loose loops from each of these single crochet stitches to start your second row, using the same technique used for the first row.


Insert the crochet hook through the stitch, yarn over, and pull the loop through to the front. Slide this loop onto the knitting needle before moving onto the next stitch.
This row should have the same number of loops in it as your first row.

, As before, you need to gather the loops into groupings and single crochet into each grouping. Do this across the row until you run out of loops.


Insert your crochet hook into five loops, chain one, then single crochet five times into the middles of all the loops on your hook.
Repeat across the row.

, Follow this same pattern to create as many rows of broomstick lace you need.


Draw up loose loops from the stitches in the previous row and form groupings from those loops.

, When you reach the end of your lace piece, cut the yarn, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the crochet thread.


Any remaining excess should be carefully woven into the back of the piece to hide it from sight and further secure the thread.

Start by making a chain of 30 stitches. This will be your foundation chain for the strip.To make the first chain, yarn over your hook twice and pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull it through the other loop. Keep doing this to continue making the chain.;
, After you have made your chain, do a double crochet stitch into the first stitch in your chain.To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook through the stitch and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first stitch, then loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, and then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete the stitch., For the next chain, double crochet twice into the same stitch. This will help to expand the strip so that the petals will fan out after you coil them., Keep going back and forth between double crocheting once and double crocheting twice all the way to the end of the row. When you reach the end, your strip is complete., To finish the strep and prepare it for coiling, cut the yarn several inches away from the last stitch. Then, pull the end of the yarn through to secure the stitch and tie the two ends together. Thread the ends through the eye of a darning needle., Starting with the end finished on, begin rolling the strip like a jelly roll. Roll the strip so that the edges stay even and the coil is tight, but not so tight that it is stretching the yarn. Keep coiling until you reach the end of the strip., After you finish coiling the strip, take the needle and insert it through multiple layers on the back side of the flower. This will be the side that does not fan out. It will look more like the base of a flower.Sew through all of the layers using several stitches and then tie off the yarn once the flower is secure.
You can leave the excess thread if you plan to use it to attach the flower to something, or you can cut the excess thread if you do not plan to use it.

, To add a finishing touch to your flower, you can sew some beads into the center. Or, you can also sew a decorative button into the center. This will make your flower look more flower-like and add a nice touch of shine or color., If you want to accent your flower even more, then try making a couple of crocheted leaves. You can sew these onto the edges of your coiled flower to make it look even more like a flower.

Use green yarn to make your leaves.

, You can leave your coiled flower around as a decorative piece or you can attach it to something. Try sewing your flower onto a hat, sweater, or scarf. Or, you can use hot glue to attach the flower to something as well."

You can make your chain as long or as short as you would like it to be as long as it is a multiple of five.For example, you could make a chain of 25, 50, or 100 stitches.









To chain, yarn over twice, and pull the first loop through the second loop. Yarn over your hook again and pull through. Repeat until your chain is the desired length.;
, Skip the first three chains and then double crochet once into each of the next two stitches.








To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook, insert the hook through the chain, and then yarn over. Pull the yarn through the first stitch, and then yarn over. Pull through the next two loops and yarn over. Then, pull through the last two loops on the hook., For your next stitch, you will need to skip the next four chains and double crochet twice into the fifth chain of your last double crochet stitch. Double crochet into this chain twice.







, Next, chain one stitch and then double crochet into the same stitch that you were just double crocheting into. This means you will have total of four double crochet stitches in the same space.








You will be working into the single chain space in your next row, so it is very important to chain one between the two sets of two double crochet stitches.

, After you finish your last two double crochet stitches in the same space, skip four and repeat the process of double crocheting two (DC2), chaining 1 (CH1), and double crocheting two again (DC2) into the same space. Then skip four and do it again. Keep repeating this process until you get to the second to last chain in your row.







, To finish your foundation row, double crochet once into each of the last two stitches in the row. This will complete your foundation row.







, To begin your next row, chain two stitches. This is your turning chain, which will provide some slack to begin working your first double crochet stitch.







, Work a double crochet stitch into the third stitch from the hook and the one after that one.







, Next, you will begin your first shell for this row. Skip over to the first chain one space from your previous row. Work two double crochet stitches into the chain one space. Then, chain one and work two more double crochet stitches into the chain one space. 








After you finish this shell, move over to the next chain one space and make another shell. You do not need to chain any stitches to move over because the shell will provide enough slack.

, Keep repeating the process of double crocheting two (DC2), chaining 1 (CH1), and double crocheting two again (DC2). Always work this pattern into the chain one space from the previous row.







, To finish your row, double crochet once into each of the last two double crochet stitches.







, Start your third row with a chain of two stitches to provide enough slack to begin your work.







, Next, double crochet one time into the next double crochet stitch.







, Follow the double crochet stitch with a dropstitch. This is a stitch that requires you to stretch the yarn out and make the loops longer than you normally would.You will be working this drop stitch into the space between your first two shell stitches from the first row. To work the drop stitch:








Yarn over.
Insert the yarn into the space between the two shell stitches you made two rows ago.
Yarn over again and pull up the loop.
Repeat this four more times so that you have a total of five stitches on the hook.

, After you complete your first dropstitch, you will need to make a shell in the next chain one space in row three. Move over to the chain one space, and then double crochet twice into the space. Chain one and then double crochet twice again.







, Continue to work a dropstitch into the space between shells from the first row and then work 2DC, CH1, and 2DC, into the next chain one space. Do this until you reach the second to last stitch in the row.







, Your last stitch for the row will be a dropstitch. Work this last dropstitch before the last two double crochet stitches from the previous row.







, Your fourth and fifth rows will follow the same pattern. Start your fourth and fifth rows with a turning chain of two chain stitches.







, Work one double crochet stitch into the first double crochet stitch from the previous row.







, Follow the double crochet stitch with another shell. Work this shell into the first chain one space from the previous row.








To make a shell, work 2DC, CH1, and 2DC into the next chain one space.

, Keep repeating the process of making shells in each of the chain one spaces to the end of the row. Do this for rows four and five., When you reach the end of the row, double crochet one time into each of the last two double crochet stitches.







, To finish your project, keep repeating rows three, four, and five in sequence. Do this until your project is the desired length.









Make sure that you change colors after every fifth row to differentiate the abstract cat design.

If you need help making slip knots or chain stitches, check the ""Tips"" section of this article.;
, Single crochet once into the second chain from the hook, then single crochet once into each stitch of your foundation chain after that.


Work in the back loops only.
Once you reach the end of the row, chain one, then turn the work over to its other side.
Check the ""Tips"" section if you need instructions on the single crochet stitch.

, Repeat the process you used for the first row, as described in the previous step, until you have enough rows to form your cuff.


For a child size mitten, you need 18 row. For an adult woman, make 22 rows. For an adult man, make 24 rows.

, Fold the cuff in half. Slip stitch once into each set of stitches along the edges opposite the fold to join those two edges together.


Consult the ""Tips"" section of this article if you need help making a slip stitch.
Do not fasten off the yarn. You will continue on with the hand of the mitten directly from the cuff instead of making two separate pieces.

, Slip stitch once into each stitch around the end of each cuff row. Join this first round with a final slip stitch.


The number of slip stitches you make should equal the number of rows you have in your cuff. For a child size mitten, this will be 18 stitches. There will be 22 for an adult woman and 24 for an adult man.

, Chain one. Single crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then single crochet twice in the next stitch. Repeat this pattern a second time time, then join the round with a slip stitch.


Note that the set of eight stitches only applies to child size mittens. For adult women, use a set of 10. For adult men, use a set of 12 stitches.

, Single crochet once in each stitch of the previous round.


Do not chain one at the beginning of this round and do not join this round with a slip stitch at the end.

, Make enough rounds to reach the thumb level of mitten. For each round, repeat the same process used in the previous step: single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round.


As before, do not chain at the beginning of a round or join the ends with a slip stitch. You should work up the side of the mitten in a spiral.
You should, however, slip stitch the end of the final round to the start of that same round before moving onto the thumb hole.
Make four more rounds for a child size mitten, six more for a woman size, and seven more for a man size.

, Work a chain of stitches large enough to wrap around half the intended wearer's thumb, then connect this chain to the previous round by single crocheting once into the appropriate stitch.


The chain should be six stitches long for a child, seven for an adult woman, and eight for an adult man.Skip over the same number of stitches in your previous round as the number of stitches in your chain, minus one. In other words, you will join the chain by single crocheting once into the sixth stitch for a child, the seventh for a woman, and the eighth for a man.
Continue single stitching once into each stitch of the previous round until you reach the end of the row.

, Work another round by single crocheting once into each stitch from the previous round.


For the thumb hole chain, make sure that you single crochet into the stitches of the chain and not over the chain or into the thumb hole itself.

, Continue working rounds until the height of the mitten reaches around the bottom knuckle area of the intended wearer's hand. For each round, simply single crochet once in each stitch of the previous round.


Work in a continuous spiral. Do not chain stitch at the beginning of a round or slip stitch at the end.
For a child's mitten, make four more rounds. Make seven more rounds for a woman's mitten and nine more for a man's mitten.

, Single crochet around the row, making three single crochet decreases at even intervals.


For a child's mitten, single crochet once in each of the next five stitches, then once into the next two stitches. Repeat this twice more, then finish by single crocheting once into the remaining stitch.
For a woman's mitten, single crochet once in each of the next six stitches, then once into the next two stitches. Repeat this twice more, then finish by single crocheting once into each of the remaining two stitches.
For a man's mitten, single crochet once in each of the next seven stitches, then once into the next two stitches. Repeat this twice more, then finish by single crocheting once into the remaining stitch.

, For the next round, simply single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round.

, For the remainder of the mitten, alternate back and forth between decreasing rows and rows in continuous single crochet, essentially repeating the previous two steps. Continue until there are no more stitches left.


For each decrease row, decrease the the stitch count by three, spacing apart your single crochet decreases in even intervals around the perimeter of the mitten.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.


Weave the excess tail into the mitten to hide it from sight and further secure the stitching.
This completes the body of one mitten. The thumb is created separately from a new strand of yarn.

, Attach yarn from the skein to your crochet hook using a slipknot. Insert your hook into any stitch along the thumb hole and slip stitch the yarn on your skein to this stitch.

, Make one single crochet in each of the stitches around the perimeter of the thumb hole. This completes one round of the thumb.


Do not chain stitch to advance to the next round. You will work in a ""continuous"" round. In other words, for each round you make, the last stitch of the round will connect directly to the first stitch of the following round.

, For each round, single crochet once into each stitch of the previous round. Continue until the thumb portion is about as tall as the intended wearer's thumb.


For a child size, the thumb should measure 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). An adult woman size will measure 2 inches (5 cm), and an adult man size will measure 2.5 inches (6.4 cm).Take this measurement from the portion of the thumb lying between the thumb and the index finger.
Usually, there will be five more rows for a child size, seven more for an adult woman, and nine more for an adult man.

, Once the thumb is long enough, round off the top by making one single crochet in every set of two stitches along the previous round.


When done, you should have half the number of stitches as you had in your previous row.
The single crochet is worked the same in this step as it would usually be worked. The only difference is that you are making the single crochet into two stitches instead of the usual one stitch.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail roughly 10 inches (25.4 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.


Do not trim the tail or weave it into your stitches yet.

, Loosely thread a yarn needle with the excess tail hanging from the thumb. Use this needle to weave the yarn through the front loops of each stitch in your final round.


Once you have gathered all of the final stitches on the tail, give the tail a tight tug, drawing the opening closed. The top of the thumb must be snug and completely closed.

, Use your yarn needle to weave the remaining tail into the stitches along the thumb. Doing so will hide the tail from sight while also securing the seal at the top of the thumb.


Weave in the starting tail at the base of your thumb, as well.
After completing this step, you should have one complete mitten.

, Working through the previous steps will create one mitten. Work through the exact same steps a second time to complete a second mitten.


Note that these mittens are the same from front to back. As such, there is no specific “left” or “right” mitten. The two are identical and can be worn on either hand.

, This step completes the project.

Settle on two or three things that need your immediate attention, and decide on a schedule for tackling anything else during the week, or during your next weekend., If you can, set aside a little time every day during the week to tackle mundane chores like doing housework, buying groceries, or paying the bills. That way, you will have more free time during your weekend to do things you enjoy., Set aside a few minutes during your weekend to plan for the upcoming week. Make a to-do list, set a few goals for things you would like to accomplish, and rough out a schedule for yourself. Taking a few minutes to write up a plan of action for the next few days can help you take your mind off your responsibilities and focus on more enjoyable things., Try to give yourself at least 24 hours during the weekend to focus on doing things you enjoy. Set specific hours for your downtime, and avoid the temptation to do or think about things that stress you out., In addition to minimizing work and chores during the weekend, you can help yourself relax and feel more in the moment by disconnecting from social media. Spending too much time on social media will not only eat away your weekend hours, but can also contribute to feelings of stress and isolation. Put away your phone or tablet, resist the urge to check your email, and simply focus on the here and now.Schedule internet-free time during your weekend. If it helps, turn off your devices or disconnect them from the internet during that time.

Get up earlier.,
Set regular times to go to bed and wake up.,
Create a relaxing bedtime routine.,
Write down whatever is worrying you.,
Minimize your screen time.",How to Make the Weekend Seem Longer3," It can be tempting to spend a lot of your weekend in bed, especially if you’re tired from a long week. However, sleeping too much can ultimately leave you feeling even more tired, and can take up hours you could have spent enjoying your time off. Resist the temptation to sleep in on the weekends.If you’re concerned about getting enough sleep, try going to bed early rather than sleeping in. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep every night to be at their best.

, Significantly changing your bed and wake-up times over the weekend can disrupt your body’s natural rhythms and leave you feeling sluggish and groggy. Try to both go to bed and get up within about an hour of when you normally would during the work week.While going to bed or getting up an hour later than usual won’t make much of a difference in how you feel, a delay of two or more hours can seriously confuse your brain and body.

, In addition to helping you sleep, taking a couple of hours to unwind before you go to bed can be pleasant and rewarding in itself. Develop a soothing pre-sleep ritual to help you stay rested and enjoy the weekend.Take a little time to relax your body. Take a warm bath or shower, get into comfy pajamas, and do some light stretches or breathing-focused meditation.

, If worrying about things you need to get done keeps you from falling asleep, set aside a few minutes before bed to write a to-do list for the next day or the upcoming week. Be sure to make note of anything you accomplished during the day, too., Avoid the temptation to watch TV or look at your phone, tablet, or computer screen right before bed. Watching media before bed can be overstimulating or stressful, and the light from screens can disrupt your ability to sleep."

,, If you feel you can't answer it, say in a flat voice: ""I am sorry, I do not understand."" (make sure you don't sound cheeky though)

,, This takes practice, but it's really effective.

, It can be about anything you want, for example, if you like a type of sport, you can research random facts about it.

, Do this for an hour and see if they notice. If they do, they're most likely to ask ""Are you alright?"" or ""Why are you talking like that?"" Return to your own voice and say ""What are you talking about?""

,, If you're not the kind of person who wants to bother with all that hassle or look like a nerd, then just try a bit harder than you usually do.

Fasten off the work.",How to Crochet Butterflies1," Insert the hook into the stitch indicated by the pattern.


At this point, you should be in the middle of a crochet project and you should already have one loop on your hook.
The butterfly stitch is worked into two stitches, and this stitch is the first of the two.;
, Yarn over the hook once from back to front, then pull the hook back through to the front of the work.


This should create a second loop on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook once from back to front. Pull this yarn-over through the top loop of your hook.


Afterward, you should have two loops on your hook.
When you complete this step, you have completed one ""wing"" of the butterfly.

, Insert the hook into the stitch immediately following the one you just worked in.


This is the second and final stitch you will work into while completing the butterfly stitch.

, Yarn over the hook once from back to front, then pull the yarn and hook back through to the front of the work.


This should create another loop on your hook, giving you a total of three loops.

, Wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over through the top two loops on your hook.


There should be two loops left on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front once more, then pull this final yarn-over through the remaining two loops on your hook.


You should be left with one loop on your hook.
The completion of this step completes a second butterfly wing.

, Work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook.


This chain stitch completes the butterfly stitch and prepares the yarn for your next stitch.

, Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches for your project.


The exact chain size will vary depending on how long you want your project to be. As a general rule, though, your chain should have an even number of stitches in it to accommodate the butterfly stitch.
Note that you can work butterfly stitches into rows or rounds. This example uses rows, but the same basic principles apply to a pattern worked in the round.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain.


This step is not strictly essential, but it does give the butterfly stitch a sturdier edge to rest on. If desired, though, you could work the butterfly stitch directly into the foundation chain or into a row made with another type of stitch (half double crochet, double crochet, etc.).
Keep in mind that the final stitch count of this row should still be an even number.

, At the start of your first row of butterfly stitches, you'll need to work a turning chain of one chain stitch.


The turning chain increases the row height enough to accommodate the first stitch of that row. Without it, the sides of the work would become uneven.
Turn the work to the other side before continuing.

, Starting with the first stitch after the turning chain, work one butterfly stitch into every pair of stitches.


Remember that the butterfly stitch uses two stitches from the previous row.
Do not skip row stitches in between butterfly stitches.
Continue working butterfly stitches into the previous row's stitches until you reach the end of the row. By that point, one full row of butterfly stitches will be complete.

, As before, work a turning chain of one chain stitch, then turn the work over to the other side.


You will need to repeat this step in between each row from now on.

, As before, you will need to work butterfly stitches into every two stitches of the previous year. Repeat until you reach the end of the row.


The first stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the first/right wing of the butterfly stitch in the row beneath it.
The second stitch of your butterfly will go into the top loop of the second/left wing of the butterfly stitch beneath it.

, Consecutive rows of butterfly stitches can be made simply by repeating the pattern of the second butterfly row. Work as many rows of butterfly stitches as desired.

, When you complete the final stitch of your project, you'll need to fasten off the yarn. After fastening off the yarn, the project is complete.


Cut the yarn, leaving a tail 4 inches (10 cm) long.
Grab this yarn tail with your crochet hook and pull it through the loop already on the hook.
This should form a secure knot and fasten off the yarn. Weave the remaining tail into the back of the stitches to hide it.

Note that the yarn should be tied to the hook using a standard slip knot.

, Chain one, then single crochet three times into the center of the foundation ring.


The chain at the beginning of the round acts as a turning chain. It sets the height of the round to accommodate the height of the single crochet stitch.

, Work a series of 16 chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Upon reaching the end of this chain, slip stitch into the last single crochet you made.


Doing so will create one of the large upper wing halves of the butterfly.

, Work three more single crochets into the center of your foundation ring.

, Work 11 chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Slip stitch the final chain of this group into the last single crochet you made.


This step will create the smaller lower half of the wing you started previously. After completing this step, one full wing is finished.

, Repeat the previous two steps to work the second small wing half of the butterfly.


Single crochet into the foundation ring three times.
Chain 11 times.
Slip stitch the last chain to the last single crochet.

, Repeat the same steps used to complete the first upper wing half to work a second upper wing half.


Single crochet into the foundation ring three times.
Chain 16 times.
Slip stitch the last of these chains to the last single crochet you created.
After completing this step, both butterfly wings should be complete.

, Single crochet once into the foundation ring, then join this single crochet to the very first single crochet you worked using another slip stitch.


At this point, the shape of the butterfly is complete.

, Cut a tail roughly 2 inches (5 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.


Weave the excess tail into the stitches to hide it.
After fastening off the yarn, the butterfly is complete and ready to attach to another separately created crochet work.

, Place the butterfly applique over the work you wish to attach it to. Consider pinning it in place to prevent it from moving around as you attach it.


If you want to attach the butterfly applique using surface crochet, as these instructions will demonstrate, you must attach it to a previously created crochet work. You can attach it to other materials, as well, but you will need to do so by sewing it on or gluing it in place.
Make sure that the butterfly is perfectly positioned over the work before proceeding.

, Work a straight line of surface slip stitches onto the material beneath the butterfly, trapping the bottom and top of the butterfly's center beneath those stitches.


Work one surface slip stitch onto the first stitch of the material. This stitch should fall directly beneath the bottom center of the butterfly.
Work your next surface slip stitch over the bottom center stitch of your butterfly. This stitch should be worked onto the next stitch of your crocheted material, just to the inside of the butterfly's center.
Continue working surface slip stitches onto the bottom material and up the center of the butterfly. Make as many stitches as necessary to reach the top of the butterfly.
Your final surface slip stitch should be worked onto the stitch of the material just outside of the butterfly's center. It should also be worked over the top center stitch of the butterfly applique.

, Once you've attached the butterfly, cut the yarn, leaving tail roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the butterfly and secure its place on the material beneath.


If you do not want to add antennae, make sure that the tail lies to the ""wrong side"" of the material. Weave the excess into your stitches to hide it, then stop at this step.
If you do want add antennae, leave the tail on the outside of the work and continue onto the next step.

, Use your thumbnail to carefully split the tail of your crochet yarn into two even halves. Unwind these halves down to the knot, then straighten them out so they point in opposite directions, forming antennae for the butterfly.


If you cannot use your thumbnail to split the yarn, consider using an embroidery needle, the blunt edge of your scissors blade, a straight pin, or a similarly thin tool.
Consider knotting the ends of the divided antennae to prevent further fraying from occurring. Alternatively, apply a small dot of seam sealant liquid to the ends of both antennae to accomplish the same purpose.
After completing this step, the butterfly is complete.

Check your phone.Usually the habits people dismiss as time-wasters will be your best friend if you're trying to make time pass by quickly.,
Surf the internet.,
Watch a film or television show.,
Play a video game.,
Go outside.Let's be serious; many of the things we'll usually think of when it comes to burning time are indoor and electronics-based.",How to Make Time Go Faster1," People sometimes spend hours browsing through their phones. Send your friends a few text messages asking how they're doing. Change the settings or ringtone on your phone. Browse your social media accounts and read the latest news. Dive into your phone and see what you can dig up.


Call someone up if you feel like talking! Spending time on the phone isn't a fun activity in of itself, but it's a useful way of staying connected to other people, and you'll usually find enough interesting things to do to keep you occupied indefinitely.;
, The internet is notorious to eating up people's time. If you have a few hours you want to see disappear quickly, going on the internet and browsing can be incredibly rewarding if done correctly. Depending on your personality and the mood you're in, there are many different activities that can be recommended to pass the time online:


Wikipedia is very easy to lose countless hours in. Try finding an article you're interested in, then give it a read. Once you're done with that, click one of the related articles that looks appealing and give that a read too. Before long you'll be too invested in learning about a variety of different things that you won't even be looking at the time. If you're the studious sort, taking active notes can help the knowledge sink in more permanently.
Social media like Facebook and Twitter is seen as the number one potential timewaster of the 21st century. It's easy to get obsessed with getting 'likes' and 'retweets' that some people give up a large proportion of their time interacting online. Although it's usually something you should keep in moderation, you may find browsing Facebook is a great way to pass time if you don't have anything pressing to do.Streaming media sites like YouTube and Bandcamp are available if you're wanting to check out new videos or music. YouTube in particular comes with a vibrant community and content for virtually any topic you can think of. Try searching up something you're interested in, or explore something fresh altogether.

, Watching a movie allows you to get lost in another world, if only for a little while. For the sake of making time go by faster however, television shows should be a go-to pastime. Look out for a show that people like to 'binge watch'. The best TV shows to pass time with tend to be serialized programs that tell a single story. This way, you don't use the episodic format as a way of remembering the time as much.


Long-form dramas like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad tend to reward those who watch multiple episodes in a row.Making sure you have somewhere quiet and comfy to watch your show is important as well. If everything around you is loud and hectic, you'll have a harder time really losing yourself in the show.
Streaming video services like Hulu and Netflix are great for this, as they have many films and shows already available for you to check out., Video games are potentially an even better way to make the time pass by than films or shows, due to the fact that you are taking an active role in the experience of the media. Whether you need to kill a little or a lot of time, sitting down and engaging yourself with a video game can be a remarkably enjoyable and rewarding experience.


For the sake of passing time, high-intensity games like racing games and first-person shooters are recommended, although people tend to report the most time spent on role-playing and open-world games., The truth is that you can find a ton of engaging stuff to do outside as well. Going outside doesn't necessarily mean you need to be doing athletic activities either, unless that's your thing. There are a number of great places you might start your outdoor adventure:


Explore your home city. Go outside, take a bus somewhere and explore part of town you've never been. You never know what kind of stuff you may come across.
Go for a walk. There are few things so simple and rewarding as going for a walk. Regardless of the weather, taking a stroll and listening to some of your favourite music can feel great. The vitamin D you'll be getting from the sunlight will also brighten your mood automatically, in case you're feeling blue.
Pick up a sport. Sports like soccer, hockey or tennis make for a great workout, and can be great fun if you've got people to play with. Call up a friend and ask if they'd like to play a game with you. For future reference, you may want to join a local team. It's a good way to make new friends, and the exercise will leave you with better health and a brighter mood.

Try freewriting.,
Do some work.,
Clean your home.,
Get some sleep.",How to Make Time Go Faster2," Freewriting is a great thing to do if you're bored and are looking for a way to bide your time. Essentially, freewriting is a stream-of-consciousness exercise where you will set aside a certain amount of time to write whatever you want. With freewriting, you don't have to worry about editing or even proper grammar or punctuation. You should just write out whatever's on your mind. Though you may find it tough to get started, it's quite likely you'll find the writing inspiration come pouring forth once you latch onto a certain idea.If you reach your given amount of time and feel impelled to keep going, do so by all means! Some of the best creative projects begin from freeform practice exercises such as this, and finding inspiration in your own work may get you so immersed you lose track of time entirely.

, If you have the option available to you, losing yourself in your job can be a lucrative way to make the hours tick by faster. Many people will notice that busy days of work pass by faster, and relaxed days feel like molasses in comparison.So long as you keep yourself busy in something you're at least mildly interested in, you shouldn't find it difficult to get time to pass by.


Catching up on work should also help to alleviate stress. It is possible you're wanting to kill time as a way to cope with stress and anxiety, so attacking the root of a problem will make you feel much better.

, Tidying is often something that gets pushed to the backs of our to-do lists when the going gets tough. When we're bored however, it can take some willpower to get around to doing it. However, once you get started with cleaning, you'll find it's easy to keep going. New things to do will constantly reveal themselves to you the longer you look.Mop up your floors. Rearrange your bookcase. Make your bed. Depending on how messy your place is, you should feel much better once your home is clean.


Rearranging furniture can be a fun and refreshing way to spruce up the feel of your home. Try switching the placement of couches; judge how a certain switch appeals to you. If you've got a creative side to you, interior design can kill time very efficiently.
There are things you can do to make cleaning more enjoyable. Turn on the TV and half-watch something while you're cleaning, or turn on some music., It should go without saying that the easiest way to make time accelerate is to go to sleep. We're usually asleep for hours at a time but it seldom ever feels that long. Sleep is something you're going to have to get at some point in the day, so if you don't have a formal sleep schedule to follow, you might consider getting a few winks as a way to pass the time. Depending on how tired or stressed you are, this could be easy or near-impossible to accomplish. Try to gauge how you're feeling, and whether or not taking a nap is right for you or not.


In most cases, if you're simply trying to make time pass by faster a nap will be more appropriate than a full-blown 8 hour stretch.
Meditating or reading before sleep are great ways to get relax yourself into a sleep-capable mindset."
"
Consider how your perception of time has sped up before.,
Allow yourself to relax.Studies have proven that the perception of time will actually slow down if you are feeling stressed out or exercising self-control.,
Stay busy.,
Keep your eyes off the clock.",How to Make Time Go Faster3," If you look into your memory hard enough, you'll find many times the time seemed to melt away. Have there been any times you checked the clock and were shocked by how late it was? What activities were you up to when this happened? Most times, it'll be because you were so occupied by something that you didn't consider to check the time. Dive into the activities that have made you forget time in the past., Letting yourself let the stress out and acting naturally will let time flow more smoothly., Above all else, keeping yourself busy is the best way to make time pass by faster.No matter what you're doing, immerse yourself in it completely. Don't let yourself get distracted! If you are doing multiple things at once, your mind will be able to break down the experience into much smaller, distinct memories.

, Whatever you do, don't look at the clock or check the time. Looking at the clock will keep you from perceiving time at a different rate. As tempting as it can be to see how much time you've burned so far, it won't help you make time pass any faster."

Take a walk.,
Go for a bike ride.,
Play a sport.,
Build a fort.,
Work in the garden.,
Look at the stars.",How to Have Fun Without Electronics1," Stroll around the block, taking in some of your favorite sights of the neighborhood. Or walk a different route than you’re used to so you can see something new. If you have access to a car or public transportation, visit a park or forest preserve and do some walking there.


Carry a backpack to collect things you might want, like interesting rocks or leaves.;
, Strap on a helmet and ride your bike through your city or town. If you don’t own a bike, many cities offer bike rentals or bike sharing programs. Try to bike down quiet, residential streets where you can enjoy the sights without stressing about the vehicle traffic around you.

, If you’re alone, kick a soccer ball around in the backyard or grab a basketball and practice free throws at the park. If there are friends you can play with, meet up at a park and play baseball, kickball, tennis, or volleyball.

, If you live near any wooded areas, scour the ground there for sticks or branches that have fallen. Stack and prop them up against a thick tree to build a little enclosure. If you’re really handy, you can print off blueprints from the internet and have someone help you construct a more intricate fort., Buy seeds or seedlings at your local hardware store or greenhouse and plant them around your house. Try planting herbs that you could later cook with, like oregano, mint, thyme, or parsley.

, If you live in a big city, it may be difficult to see any stars, but if they’re visible, go outside once it’s dark out and lay down on a blanket. You can print off constellation charts and try to find the patterns in the sky, or you can just lay back and relax."

Meet a friend at a cafe.,
Volunteer for a community project.,
Visit an older relative or family friend.,
Play a board or card game.",How to Have Fun Without Electronics2," Ask an old or a new friend to meet you at a casual spot that serves coffee, tea, or even ice cream. Sit down, talk, and catch up. If you want to keep the conversation going, offer to split a pastry or other treat with them.

, See if your local food pantry, animal shelter, or soup kitchen need any volunteers. Local schools may need assistance with gardening or fundraising, so check with administrators to see if there’s anything you can help with.


Look for something that aligns with your interests and skills. For example, if you’re not a people person, volunteer at an animal rescue organization.Consider starting your own project. Get friends and community members to help you pick up trash along the street or create a mural somewhere.

, Go see a grandparent or aunt or uncle if they live nearby. Ask them to tell stories about what they did before today's electronics. Not only will this offer them a greater sense of bonding and connection with you, but you'll probably learn a lot from them., Gather everyone around the table and take turns playing each person’s favorite game. If you don’t have any board games, go on a group shopping trip and pick one out together, or just make your own from materials you have around the house.Toys like Legos or action figures can act as game pieces, and a small piece of cardboard folded into a cube can be a die.

Read a book.,
Write a story.,
Play music.,
Draw or paint.",How to Have Fun Without Electronics3," Pick up a story you’ve been meaning to read, or reread an old one that you loved when you were younger. If there’s nothing at home that interests you, visit your local library. Pick out a few books at random or ask the librarian to help you find something specific.

, Pull out a notebook and a pen and start writing. Either brainstorm ideas for a new story, or just dive right into an idea that’s forming in your mind. Try free-writing an entire page without stopping the movement of your pen. You may end up with something nonsensical, but it’s a good way to avoid second-guessing yourself during the creative process., Pull out any old instruments that may be lying around the house – a guitar, a drum, or even an old player piano that's gathering dust. Find some sheet music to play, or just improvise a tune off the top of your head. Not only can playing music put you in a better mood, but it will also help to increase cognitive function and improve memory.If you don't have any instruments at home, you can make a drum using a tin can and some construction paper or leather.

, Gather any art supplies you have lying around, like paper, canvas, paints, paintbrushes, charcoal, or just plain pencils. Find a sunny spot and draw an image that’s in your mind or paint a canvas to match your home’s decor. If you make your drawings or paintings small, you could give them away later as greeting cards."

Finished!",How to Crochet a Visor1," The size of the visor will need to vary depending on the circumference of the wearer's head. The gauge is 4 single crochet stitches = 1 inch. These instructions are for heads measuring 19 inches (48.26 cm) in circumference, with additional instructions regarding how to scale the size of the visor up or down as needed for larger or smaller sizes.









To measure your head circumference, wrap a flexible measuring tape around the head, placing it just above the top of the ears. The tape should be gentle and flat. Make sure that it it centered over your occipital bone, or the bump in the middle of the back of your head.It is generally a good idea to measure your head size several times for the sake of accuracy. If you can look in the mirror or have someone else help you measure, the results will generally be even more accurate.;
, Use a standard slip knot to attach the yarn to the crochet hook.








, Chain stitch 52 times. At the end of your chain, slip stitch the first and last chains together, forming a ring.








Increase or decrease the chain amount by four chain stitches for every 1 inch (2.5 cm) of head circumference. For example, chain 48 for an 18 inch (45.72 cm) head or chain 56 for a 20 inch (50.8 cm) head.
Make sure that the chain does not twist when you join the ends together.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into the first chain and once into each chain around the entire ring. Join the last and first single crochets together with a slip stitch.

The number of single crochet stitches made in this round should match the number of chain stitches made in your foundation ring.

, Chain four, then treble crochet once into the next stitch and once into each stitch of the previous round. Join the last treble stitch to the base of your chain-four with a slip stitch.









Note that your initial chain-four counts as your first treble crochet. Including this chain-four, you should have the same number of treble crochet in this round as chains in your original ring.
Do not turn the work over at the end of this round.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into the first stitch and once into each of the treble stitches in your previous round. Join the last and first single crochets together with a slip stitch.









The number of single crochets in this round should match the number of chain stitches in your foundation ring.
This is the final round needed for the band of your visor.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail of 2 inches (5 cm). Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to bind off and secure the yarn.









Weave the excess tail into your stitches to hide it.
Look at both sides of the band. Determine which looks best, then turn the band so that this ""right side"" faces you.

, Use a slip knot to attach a fresh strand of yarn to your crochet hook.









If you want the brim and band to match, use the same yarn for both. You can also switch yarn colors at this time to make a two-toned visor.

, Join the brim yarn to the band using a slip stitch. Count 21 stitches away from the beginning of the round and place the joint there.









Add or subtract one stitch for each 1 inch (2.5 cm) of head circumference. For an 18 inch (45.72 cm) head, join at stitch 20 of the band. For a 20 inch (50.8 cm) head, join at stitch 22 of the band.
To join the new yarn, insert the hook into the indicated stitch, yarn over, then pull the yarn-over through the stitch and the loop on your hook in the same motion., Chain one, then single crochet twice into the stitch you joined the yarn to. Single crochet twice into each of the next 11 stitches, as well.

, That person then passes on the message until it travels all the way down the line. The last person says what they heard aloud and the person who started the message reveals what was actually said.For this game to work, you’ll need no less than five people.

, Start singing a popular song and have your friends join in. If you know several songs by the same artist, perform a medley of their music. Have people try to sing the harmonies and trade the melodies off between singers.


If you’re feeling really inspired, choreograph a dance to match. Practice the dance and see if there’s somewhere you can perform it, like a talent show or in front of your classmates.
You can also improvise a song. To do this, just start singing any made up melody that comes to your head. Have your friends improvise harmonies to go along with your melody. The trick to improvisational music is not to judge yourself., Sit across from your friend. Pick a comfortable position that you can remain in for a while. Stare into each other’s eyes without blinking or looking away. Whoever blinks, looks away or laughs first loses.


You are allowed to make funny faces at your partner in order to try to break them. Be careful that you don’t accidentally make yourself laugh instead.

If not, your friend will try again.


Be careful not to hit the hands too hard as this can cause soreness and redness.

, To-do lists are great because they help keep you organized and allow you to prioritize.In your mind, make a list of everything you need to do that day and figure out in what order you want to complete the tasks.


When creating a to-do list, prioritize quality over quantity. Don’t just add something to your list because it’s easy to cross off., Being able to hold your breath for long periods of time is beneficial for certain sports, like swimming or surfing.It’s also a great way to keep yourself occupied when you have nothing else to do.

Be mindful that holding your breath for too long can lead to health risks, including fatal blackouts., Whatever your fantasy is, live it out in your brain for a few minutes. Imagination is important because it helps you reignite your passions and stimulates your creativity.Let your mind drift off wherever it wants to go.

Fix your household objects. Maybe your sink leaks and needs fixing, or the front steps sag. Take this time to fix that squeaky door and you'll feel accomplished instead of bored!

If you're traveling with another person, turn it into a game. See who can overhear the weirdest conversation or sentence.

, When you're traveling you can be anyone you want to be. Come up with a mildly plausible persona and stick to it while you're on the airplane, at the bus depot, waiting for the train, etc. See if you can get people to believe your persona.

Just write something meaningful that the other person would want to keep as a memento.You can consider writing a letter to friends, significant others, or even family.
Send it by mail or leave it somewhere you know they will find it, like in their room or locker.
Don’t write anything you wouldn’t want a third party to read.

, Look around and see how you can use the things around you to make art or useful household goods. With pictures and glue, you can make a nice memento for someone you care about. With wood and carving knife you can make a walking stick."

Invite a friend over.,
Have a movie or TV show marathon.,
Read a book.,
Pamper yourself with a home spa day.,
Take a nap.",How to Beat Boredom on a Rainy Day1," Rather than spending your rainy day at home by yourself, invite a friend over to spend it with. You might find that having someone else around can help make the day feel a little less boring and dull.


You can do most of these activities alone or with a friend, so if you have a friend over, there is plenty you can do with them! Rainy days are also a great time to play some video games, have a long talk, or watch some movies.;
, Watch movies you own on DVD, or use an online streaming service like Netflix or Hulu to marathon your favorite movies, or watch endless episodes of your favorite TV show.


Pop some popcorn and take advantage of the gloomy darkness that comes with a rainy day! Rainy days are the perfect opportunity to catch up on the last season of a favorite show, or to finally watch that movie everyone has been talking about.

If you don’t already have a book you want to read, there are plenty of book lists specifically tailored to read on rainy days! Do a little internet search or check out GoodReads online for rainy day suggestions.

, Take a relaxing bubble bath, listen to some soothing music, and treat yourself to a face mask or body scrub. You can even make your own face masks and body scrubs from ingredients in your kitchen, so you don’t have to go out in the rain to get supplies!


Warm 2 tablespoons of honey in the microwave for a moment, then add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of lemon juice. Mix these together, then apply to your face, avoiding your eyes. Let it sit and soak in for 15-20 minutes, enjoying the warmth of the honey on your skin. Wash the mask off with warm water.

Rearrange the furniture.,
Start a project.,
Try a new recipe.",How to Beat Boredom on a Rainy Day2," If you’re a student, chances are you probably have some homework or classwork you could get done, or get ahead on. Spend some time on your rainy day getting work completed, or even checking back over work you’ve already finished and are getting ready for submission.


If you’re out of school or on break, you could try getting prepared for school to return by creating a calendar or schedule for upcoming projects, assignments, and events. You can make this by hand on paper, or you can use an online or digital tool to create one, like My Study Life or Google Calendar.

, If there are piles of clutter all over your house, spend a rainy day getting things back into order. Start with a certain room in the house, and make your way through to each one. Go through loose papers and receipts, fold and organize clothes, and put away things that have been left out.


If you have a lot of loose paper around, make separate folders to keep it in. Keep a folder for receipts, a folder for mail, a folder for important documents like bank statements, and even one for school papers. Putting things in order will help you find them later.Try organizing the cabinets and drawers in your bathroom. You might be surprised how much clutter can accumulate in those places. Throw out empty shampoo bottles, corral all the loose cotton balls and swabs into proper containers, and keep your cleaners and wipes in one spot.

, Everyone has chores, and if you happen to be behind on yours, use your rainy day as a way to catch up on them. Run a load of laundry, wipe down countertops, make the bed, and do the dishes.


Make cleaning fun! Put on music, and sing and dance along while you work. You could also make mopping fun by rubber-banding some sponges or old towels to your feet and dancing across the kitchen floor to mop it!, Through all your organizing and cleaning, you might come across some items you don’t use or need anymore. Rather than tossing these things in the trash, donate them to a local donation location, like a church or Goodwill store.


Go through all of your clothes, in both your closet and your dresser. Make separate piles for keeping, donating, and and taking to a consignment shop to sell. Once you’ve decided on what to keep, put it away neatly and in an organized way.If there are other people in your household, ask them to pitch in for donations, too. Your parents, siblings, spouse, or children can all take a look through their clothing and belongings and get rid of anything they don’t need.

There are certain methods to arranging furniture in the best way possible, such as placing the sofa across from a central focus, like your television.You could also try moving the furniture in your bedroom.

Hold a treasure hunt.,
Build a fort and camp indoors.,
Do some arts and crafts.,
Bake and decorate cookies.,
Break out the board games.",How to Beat Boredom on a Rainy Day3," Use some of your kids’ favorite toys and objects and hide them around the house. Send the kids to find them, and promise a treat for the one who finds the most, or finds them the fastest!

Try making up a list of clues for the kids to help them find their treasures. You can even have a little extra fun by making the clues into rhymes.
The treasures could be things other than toys. Create paper coupons for things like “One Free Hug” or “One Chocolate Bar.” Let them keep the coupons to cash in whenever they want!

, There are few things more fun than making a blanket fort, no matter how old you are. Rainy days are a great time to move the furniture, use books and blankets to build a fort, and cuddle up inside with your family.


The kitchen table is a great piece of furniture to build a fort around. Drape a blanket or sheet over the table and chairs to widen the fort, then put pillows and blankets inside to lie down on.Make sure not to rig anything in such a way that it might easily fall over onto someone. Avoid stacking furniture. Use lightweight objects and avoid tugging on the fort walls to keep them from falling.

, Get out a box of crayons, markers, or colored pencils and have the kids draw some pictures. Use dry pasta and glue to create fun noodle sculptures and pictures. Find some old magazines and help them cut out pictures they like to make collages.


You can even use dry pasta, glue, and string to make little “ornaments” to hang around the house. Have your kids glue pasta into fun shapes, loop a string through and tie it, and hang the creation!, Use a box of packaged cookie mix, or find a recipe to make cookies. Simple sugar cookies work best for decorating. Make a batch and let them cool before allowing the kids to decorate them.


Use whatever decorations you have on hand for decorating the cookies. Use food dye to color the icing, and use everything from gummies to sprinkles for decorating the cookies.If you make your own cookie dough, use a rolling pin to roll it out and let your kids use cookie cutters (or even their own fingers!) to make shapes in the dough. Just make sure to supervise any cutting.

, If you have kids, you likely have at least a few board games lying around the house. Pick the kids’ favorite games and take turns playing each one. Make simple, classic games like Jenga more fun by adding in your own rules, like whoever knocks the stack over has to do a silly dance.


Well-known and safe sources like Nick, PBS, and Disney all offer online games for kids, as well. You can play these games with your young children to make sure they’re using the internet safely.

Find new music.,
Read.,
Meditate.,
Revisit your childhood.,
Call someone you haven't spoken to in a while.,
Watch something unusual.,
Create a schedule.,
Be bored.",How to Be Less Bored (for Teen Girls)1," Read a new music website, search for playlists by a musician you like, or listen to a website that makes suggestions. Scroll through your social media and tell yourself you have to listen to the first song any friend has posted. Listen to that, and if you don't like it do it again.


Look up your favorite music artists and find out who they call an influence. You might be surprised by the sounds your favorites grew up hearing.
Alternatively, look through your music to find something you haven't listened to in forever. Take a trip down sonic memory lane.;
, Read a novel, a comic, or poetry. Look through bookshelves if there are any in your house. Read magazine articles online about a topic that intrigues you. If you don't have any books in the house, visit your local library. If you can't find the books you want, sometimes you can order them through interlibrary loan: ask your librarian, or look on your library's website.


Read up. If you're a good reader and are bored with YA, read books written for adults. If you don't understand everything, don't worry. There is value in reading difficult literature, and it can often be more interesting to read something you don't understand than something you find easy.
Read some old YA authors. Before YA was popular, authors like Diana Wynne Jones, Tove Jansson, Roald Dahl, and Noel Streatfeild wrote novels for children that are appropriate for teen and adult readers.

, If you can't think of anything to do, try thinking of nothing at all. Do a concentration meditation in which you focus on one thing, such as a candle flame, a flower, or a repetitive motion. Focus for several minutes. When your mind wanders, remind yourself to focus on what you are doing.Do a mindfulness meditation in which you focus on your senses. Pay attention to your breathing, how each part of your body feels, and what you can hear, see, smell, and taste., Go back to anything that made you happy as a kid. Build a pillow sheet fort, dig up a long-forgotten stuffed animal, or try to remember and write down an imagination game that used to fascinate you. Find an old drawing and attempt to recreate it—it's harder than it sounds.


Find an old photo album and learn what your parents thought was fashionable when they were your age.
Pose for your baby pictures again-try to get the lighting, the outfit, the pose and the facial expression just right.

, You can call your grandfather or an old friend who moved out of state. Catch up on this person's life by asking lots of questions. Ask what he or she has been thinking about lately, worrying about lately, and enjoying lately.

, If you normally watch comedies, look up a documentary. If you normally watch shows, watch a lengthy feature film. Don't just go for whatever gets suggested: look up lists of the best art house films of all time, the greatest films ever made, the most beautiful animated films, the documentaries that changed the world. Watch a comedy from the 1930s and wrap your head around the ways humor has changed.


If you need another guideline, pick your film according to a rule. For instance, use the Bechdel test. You can only watch a film if it has (1) at least two named female characters who (2) have at least one conversation together (3) about anything other than men., This sounds boring, but think about it: boredom feels like you're in an endless desert of time. A schedule helps you shape the time you have. Think about what you need to do today (homework, chores), what you want to do today, and then write yourself up a schedule of those things. Include the basic stuff, like ""lunch.""

, Boredom is unpleasant, but it can also be useful. If you were busy or entertained all the time, you wouldn't have time to form any life-changing thoughts. When you're bored, you unconsciously take stock of your life and set new goals. If you weren't bored, you wouldn't change, so take it to the next level: think about the things that have made you bored, and figure out what needs to change.For instance, if you are always alone after school, now could be the time to join an after-school organization.
If you are bored because you don't have many friends, making friends could be your new goal.
If you are bored because you have lost interest in the things you like, or you can't focus on anything, you might be depressed. If you are anxious and bored, you might have ADHD.Talk to an adult or a doctor about your boredom.

Go on a wander.,
Visit strange shops.,
Pack a picnic.",How to Be Less Bored (for Teen Girls)2," Instead of going on a walk, go on a wander. Instead of walking somewhere you go all the time, walk on streets you don't know well. Take public transportation to a park, lake, or other natural space you haven't visited. Take your cell phone, take a friend with ou if you want, and let your family know that you are wandering.


Take a map and draw a wiggly path on it without looking. Challenge yourself to walk along the path you drew as closely as you can. Make sure it loops you back home!

, Is there a downtown or shopping center where you live? Go to stores you have never entered. Challenge yourself to find something you like in each place. You don't have to buy anything, but try to get a sense of what you would buy if you were someone who shopped there. Each store is selling an image, so explore the ways those images can fit you or not.


For instance, you could visit an vintage store and explore dated fashion and obsolete technology. Imagine what it was like to wear a corset, wear a hat every day, or ""dial"" a phone.

, Ask a friend to go on a picnic with you, and pack a bag or a basket of treats, a picnic blanket, and maybe a good book or two. You can pack the whole picnic yourself, or ask your friend to bring one or two things (a beverage, a fruit) while you bring the rest.


Visit a farmer's market or a grocery store together and pick out 3-6 things together. You might get fresh bread, apples, cheese, chocolate, carrots, and hummus, for example.
Take your picnic somewhere green and quiet, or somewhere with a good view.
Go on a hike if you can. Eat the picnic at the top of the mountain or end of the trail. Make sure to pack water!

Start a band.",How to Be Less Bored (for Teen Girls)3," By yourself or with a friend, design a casual journal you can put out once a month or every two weeks. You can write content, invite contributions from others, and even share editing responsibilities with a friend: for instance, she or he could be in charge of art and poetry, while you could supply opinion pieces and book reviews.


Possible content for a zine include: reviews of shows, books, movies, and albums, outside submissions of poetry, photographs, and drawings, lists, trivia, humor, political commentary, and fashion tips.
Stay true to the punk spirit of the ""zine"" and make them yourself. All you need is a photocopier and a stapler.
Pass out your zine to members of your community. Leave them in lobbies, common rooms, and sneak them into magazine racks at stores.
Zines are fun because they are super representative of the place they are made. Ask for contributions from the people you see weekly: the proctors at your school, your favorite barista, the kids you babysit, your grandmother.

, Teach yourself to build a website from scratch, or use a blogging template. Your website can showcase your work, your tastes, or be an online journal. You can also start a webzine instead of a ""zine,"" and solicit contributions from strangers in the world.

, Look up some basic recipes you have never tried. How basic can they be? Try to find 3-5 ingredient recipes. For example, you can make a flatbread with just water and flour and salt. You can make truffles out of tahini, cocoa powder, and dates. You can make an omelet with just eggs, butter, and salt.


Cook without a recipe. Use inexpensive ingredients and experiment. Try to recreate something you have eaten in a restaurant, or invent a twist on a dish you enjoy.
Clean up as you go. Cooking is more fun when there aren't a bunch of dishes at the end.

, Do you like to draw, to write, to dance, to sing? Get some space and materials and make something. Get yourself started by spacing out with the medium you use: move around to music, doodle shapes, freewrite. If your mind is blank, give yourself a prompt. For instance, if you are writing, start yourself off with a line from a song you like.


Make something you can use, like a notebook or a scarf.
Make art for someone. Make a card, write a beautiful letter, or paint a picture for someone you love. If you know someone who is going through a hard time, make something for them.
Make a movie. Make a long film of something interesting. You can appear in it, or it can focus on other people, animals, things you observe. Try to film a portrait of a place: all the most strikingly beautiful, plain, ugly, active, and quiet places in your neighborhood, for instance.
Write fanfiction. Take the characters from a book or show you enjoy, and write them some adventures. Take a neglected character and give her a starring role.

, Get your musical friends with tastes similar to yours and start a band. If you know how to play instruments, so much the better. You don't need much to make a sound: you can improvise drums, you can sing together, and someone somewhere probably knows how to play guitar.

Plant something.,
Volunteer.,
Get a job.,
Perform a random act of kindness.",How to Be Less Bored (for Teen Girls)4," If you have space for a garden at your house, see what grows well in your local climate and plant it. If you don't have space for a garden, see if you have space for planters, pots, or a window box. You can grow herbs and flowers in very little space. If you live somewhere dry, succulents can be beautiful and need very little care.


A garden is a commitment, so start small if you're not ready to be in charge of an army of zucchini. Grow one plant in a pot, and if that goes well, you can start tilling earth.

, Volunteer to help out in a place that interests you. Places like elementary schools, schools for people with special needs, hospitals, and retirement communities often need volunteers. You can also volunteer for temporary organizations, such as political campaigns or fundraising events.


Ask someone in your life if they need help. Just do it right now. Ask a parent, a grandparent, or a neighbor.

, Earning money and learning new skills can be entertaining as well as useful. Visit businesses you can get to by bike or by bus and ask if they are hiring. Look online at job boards. Ask your family members for tips: they may know someone who can help you find a job that isn't advertised.


Go into business for yourself. Sell things you craft online, sell cookies at school, or call neighbors and family friends and offer to babysit, sit for cats, look after plants, walk dogs, mow lawns, or wash cars.

, Do something unexpected that you know will be appreciated. Drop flowers or candy at your best friend's house, or wash your family's car. Offer to play a game you know a little sibling loves, even though you find it boring. You're already bored, so you might as well be bored in a sweet way.

Know that you are in charge of your own boredom.,

Volunteer your time for community service.,
Prevent repeating periods of boredom with mindfulness training.",How to Avoid Being Bored When You Have Nothing to Do1," Boredom, unlike most other emotions, is a choice. When you view boredom as a choice you suddenly realize that you have the ability to entertain yourself. At the bare minimum, you have a human brain at your disposal, an incredible organ that can invent, imagine, and think about the world around you. Don’t let yourself feel bored because there is no one around to tell you what to do – take matters into your own hands.Take a moment to think about why you are bored. Is it the world around you? Or have you just not chosen to do anything that stimulates your interest?
Some people find the history of volcanoes interesting, while others fall asleep at the thought of it. Everything has the power to be interesting—it is up to you to show interest.;
, No matter how few things you have to do, your brain is always around to entertain you. Try creating an imaginary world or a new animal. This can be a silly project for an afternoon, or the beginning of a new story or series of art pieces.

, A curious mind finds everything interesting, and thus avoids boredom at every turn. Wonder about the architecture around your town. How was that building designed? Who painted the graffiti down the street? What techniques went into making the clothes in the window? Curiosity stimulates the brain and leads to ideas for new activities, like looking up the producer of your favorite albums or taking a cooking class.

, There is no bigger block to getting over boredom than overthinking the situation. Trying to find the “perfect” activity is a sure-fire way to do no activity at all, so stop thinking and do something. Call a friend you haven’t spoken with, put on shoes and go walking, or turn into the café you’ve always wanted to try. Being spontaneous lends your life an air of surprise that makes everything less boring.

, A small notepad and pencil costs a little more than $1, but it can provide endless entertainment on the go. Simply slip it into your purse or back pocket and pull it out when you feel restless to draw or write on the go. Simple activities to try include:


Write a novel
Doodle or Draw
Writing songs, poetry, or short stories
Recording funny bits of conversation from strangers
Making shopping lists, studying for school, or journaling

, If you're interested in writing, but can't think of anything to write, try a freewrite or a stream of consciousness exercise. These might lead you to an idea for a more structured story, play, or poem. If you're stuck for ideas, try looking up writing prompts online. It may also help to challenge yourself to write a story with an artificial constraint, such as only using one syllable words., Depending on where you are, meeting someone new may be the best way to avoid boredom. Pay them a compliment, make a comment about your surroundings (the weather, the train, a street musician, anything), or simply introduce yourself. You never know what you will learn from a stranger, but it will certainly not be boring.


Always be careful talking to strangers in dark, private, or unsafe areas.

, This is a great way to meet new people and get out of the house, and it’s completely free. Call your local SPCA, American Cancer Society, or college campus and ask about volunteering opportunities, or look some up online.

, If you become bored or restless when standing in line, waiting for a friend, or during other short periods of time when you can't find an activity, finding a distraction in a book or cell phone may not cure this problem. Meditation is the art of focusing on your thoughts and mind, enjoying the little things around your instead of feeling restless or bored.The Buddhist tradition of mindfulness stresses being in the moment, thinking about the life you are living instead of the life you wish you had.

If you have pipe cleaners and a couple other art supplies, you can make a silly alien.

For example, if you want to learn guitar, you can spend your time listening to new guitarists to study their technique.

, Most people listen to music passively, hearing it in the background while doing other things. This is easy with songs you already know and love, but it can be boring if the only thing you are doing is listening to music. Eliminate boredom by finding new music, which makes listening to music more of an activity and less of an ambiance.


Searching for new music on Pandora, Spotify, Songza, or other music apps is a great way to get new songs similar to the ones you love.
Try out podcasts, which are free radio programs you can download off iTunes. They cover comedy, news, music, entertainment, and more.

, If you are often bored looking for something to do at home, take some time to pick out some arts and crafts supplies. You don't need to devote yourself to perfecting a new hobby, although you certainly can. Just try out a few different crafts, such as pottery or bead jewelry, until you find one that passes the time enjoyably.


If you are more interested in house improvement or ""do it yourself"" repairs, pick up a new skill such as carpentry or roof repair.

, You can make a bored jar so you will never bored again. Just get a paper or some popsicle sticks and a jar. Grab a marker and write suggestions that are fun or things that you like to do.

Exercise.,

Go for a hike, walk, or picnic.,
Pick up gardening.",How to Avoid Being Bored When You Have Nothing to Do3," Exercising may not be easy to start, but once you ""get in the rhythm"" you might start enjoying yourself, or at least be glad you're doing something instead of sitting around bored. If push-ups, sit-ups, and similar exercises bore you, try out a physical activity such as dancing, yoga, or running.


People who exercise with someone with a similar fitness level and similar fitness goals are more likely to enjoy themselves and stick to regular exercise., If you can get a whole group of friends together, try an outdoor game such as ultimate frisbee or red rover, or capture the flag.


If you enjoy spending time with people and frequently get bored and lonely on the weekends, try organizing a weekly sports club.
Contact your local parks and recreation department and ask about local sports leagues for both children and adults. They are usually low key, weekly games that get you out of the house easily.

, Getting out of the house can often help get rid of boredom. Pack a few sandwiches and take a walk, go on a hike, or have a bike ride. This may clear your head and stop you feeling stir crazy.


On a hike or other longer trip outdoors, try bringing a book to keep yourself entertained if you get tired or bored of physical activity. Leaving electronic entertainment devices behind is recommended, however, as they make it difficult to enjoy natural surroundings.

, Tending plants is very relaxing and makes you feel connected to the earth, and they require almost daily care. Go to your local hardware store to pick up seeds and topsoil and build your garden, or purchase potted plants to care for.

Write in a journal.,
Write a short story.,
Write poetry.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night2," Journaling is an amazing way to gain insight into your feelings and to record moments from your daily life.

Journaling is most effective if it becomes a habit, so try to write in your journal more often than just Saturday nights., Writing a short story often seems daunting, and you may be worried that you don't have enough creativity.

Go to a nature preserve or park.,
Walk in a city.,
Go star-gazing.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night3," If the weather is nice, go for a walk.

Write lyrics for a song.,
Play an instrument.,
Sing.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night4," If you're musically inclined, try your hand at writing a song and lyrics to go with it. Writing a song is much like writing poetry, but you'll have have to fit the lyrics to a melody. Grab a pen and paper, then write about how you're feeling or about a situation you were in recently., Many people have an instrument gathering dust in a corner or a closet. Quiet Saturday nights are the perfect time to put the instrument to use and learn how to play. Start slow, and use internet tutorials or music books to learn the basics. If you don't already have an instrument, buy an inexpensive instrument like a ukulele or melodica with a basic songbook., One of the best things about being home alone is that you can sing as loud as you want, and no one will be annoyed.

Watch a movie in a different language.,
Make your own movie.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night5," There are many ways to stream movies on demand nowadays, and it's pretty inexpensive: try Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Media. If you don't have the internet, make a trip to a Redbox or rewatch a movie you've already seen. If you've got a long night alone, watch more than one movie.Make some popcorn or other snacks for extra fun. Movie night isn't the same without some popcorn and movie theater candy, so make a trip to the grocery store for some inexpensive snacks.

Knit.,
Make decorations for your house.,
Stain glass.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night6," Not only is knitting relaxing, but you end up with a useful product at the end of your hard work. Knitting requires a little practice and some supplies, so head to your local craft shop and pick up needles, yarn, and an instruction book.

Go for a bike ride.,
Jog.,
Go swimming.,
Do some weight-lifting.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night7," If you have a bike and good path for cycling, go out for a bike ride. Cycling is a great form of exercise because you burn a lot of calories without as much high impact as running. Cycle around your area to get some exercise, and time your laps if you want to compete with yourself. Bike riding will depend a lot on the weather, so don't go out if it's too wet or cold and be careful on busy streets, as cars often don't see cyclists., Whether you have a treadmill or the weather is nice, get a little jogging in. Jogging will give you more energy for your activities later, and burn off some calories from any unhealthy food you may have eaten over the weekend. Make sure you have a good pair of running shoes and some comfortable workout clothes. Don't take it too fast if you don't run often, and make sure to stretch before and after you jog., If the weather allows, go for a swim. Whether you have access to a pool, a lake or the ocean, swimming is a great way to get some exercise. Swimming is even easier on your body than cycling or running, because it's even lower-impact than other cardio exercise. Grab a swimsuit and do some laps: time your laps for competitive fun., Weight lifting is great for your body, and helps you look good too. Keep in mind that one night of lifting weights won't do much for your physique. You'll have to keep it up and continue lifting weights several types a week. However, quiet Saturday nights are a great time to start. Go to a nearby gym or invest in a weight set for your house, then learn the basics. The types of exercises you need to do will depend on your goals, so talk to a trainer or consult weightlifting books for more information that's tailored to you."

Play games online.,
Go on a site to chat with strangers.,
Edit online articles.,
Watch funny videos.,
Spend time on social media.",How to Have Fun by Yourself on a Saturday Night8," There are many websites devoted entirely to games. Whether you like to play simple games like Solitaire or complex video games, you're bound to find something you love. Start by typing the name of the game you want to play into a search engine, then look for a version that you like.


For more complex or multiplayer video games, try downloading a game store browser. Browsers like Steam let you search for video games by genre, and many are inexpensive or even free., If you're over 18, there are many fun sites that you can use to chat with strangers from around the world. Talk to people your age from South America, Europe and Asia using chat clients like Omegle or ChatRoulette.Stay safe and be careful when chatting online: remember never give out any personal information.

, Sites like WikiHow and Wikipedia allow you to edit articles and contribute to the site. Editing these articles is especially fun if you have knowledge on a particular topic and like to write. Check out online encyclopedias and learn how their articles are formatted, then begin contributing your knowledge.

, Comedy videos come in all varieties, and you can find plenty on Youtube, Vimeo and Vine.

Look for weird people, strange graffiti, pets, flowers, stains on the concrete--look for anything. Take lots of close-up pictures of the interesting things you find as an art project.


When you get back to your house, you could caption each picture and print them out for a project like a scrap book or a collage, or give them interesting titles and put them on the internet.
Come up with a story that links all the images together and write it.;
, Cut up old magazines and put heads on the wrong bodies, or put Tiger Woods next to the Mars rover. Cut out large lips from make-up ads and give them googly eyes with thought bubbles that say ""Earth is overrated"" or ""Tuna Shark"" or ""Wednesday makes the people jealous.""


Make an edition of several hundred of these, matted on high-quality card-stock.
Hang them on the walls of the living room and dress in your Sunday clothes.
Sip sparkling water from a tall glass and look at them very seriously. Very seriously.
Say things like, ""This is terribly post-modern"" and ""Kandinsky, methinks.""

, You think the library's boring? Think again. It's like shopping somewhere they let you steal things. Go check out books, movies, comics, and music, FOR FREE. What's not to like?


Alternatively, pull a book off the shelf you've always meant to read but never got around to. If you've got your own library staring you in the face, hop to it., The moon base is abandoned and the last astronaut from Earth is hearing voices. Scary, scary voices. The voices of his dead wife's hamster. Write out the basic story as quickly as possible, then set it up your camera or phone to record you. Does it make sense? Who cares? Make sure you adjust the lighting.


Instead of the other actors, act out each character yourself and edit them together later on the computer. Or use drawings with the lips cut out and your own lips in their place. Or use stuffed animals.

, Flarf is poetry made up of quotations from the Internet. Steal language from everywhere, Internet ads, YouTube videos, magazines, books, and cut it up into weird poems.


To make analog Flarf, cut out individual sentences from the newspaper, or cut out things from magazines and glue it all together in weird ransom notes. Mail it to a friend, or scan it and email it. Start a tumblr under your poet pseudonym. Get Internet famous for weirdness.

, Take some quarters and go put them in expired parking meters, or just sit outside a coffee shop and tell people they look nice today. Compliment strangers. Call up someone you respect and tell them how much they mean to you.

, Haven't talked to your grandmother or long-lost friend in a while? Shoot them a call. Instead of vegging out watching television or wasting time with video games, get back in touch with someone you might've lost contact with. Even a short 15 minute phone call can do wonders in touching someone's life and letting them know you're there. Ask how they're doing, what they've been up to, and where they're going.


Alternatively, you could go super-analog and write a letter. Like, an actual pen and ink letter. With your own handwriting! Draw pictures, talk about your week and your goals, and ask how your friend is getting along. Even if they just live across town, a letter or a postcard can be a great gift. Yes, emails will do in a pinch.

, It's the thing you do where you move your legs faster than they normally go and wear shorts. Some people think it's fun? Maybe you should listen to music while you do it.

, Yeah, yeah, it's no fun. But if you're alone and you've got time to kill, there are few things more productive than getting some cleaning done. And, clean spaces make happy people. Set yourself a short goal, like that you want to clean your room in less than 30 minutes, or you want to tidy the whole house in the next hour, and then move as quickly as possible to make it exciting. Put on loud or frantic music to turn it into your own fast-forward movie.

, Don't worry, Britney Spears can't sing either. Get on the computer and download free music editing software with a good range of effects. GarageBand and Audacity are common options. Open a new track and hit record.


Make the sounds of a choking cat, or recite the Pledge of Allegiance in a tinny mouse voice. Do over-dubs with other weird voice sounds, or lay down some sick drums by playing the pencil on your desktop. Do a whole track of you making police siren noises with your mouth.
Go back over the tracks and mess with the effects to make them sound like electric guitars and synthesizers. Play around with the reverb and echo to make it sound like alien transmissions. Have fun with it.
Name your song something ridiculous, like ""Moon Unit Transmission Delta"" and then play it for your grandparents.

, Cue up some Tibetan Chant music on YouTube, or some Japanese punk rock and listen to it. Invent a new dance routine to the weird sounds. Get low, shorty. Explore weird music until you find something you like. Check out:


Robert Ashley
John Fahey
Black Moth Super Rainbow
Jefre Cantu-Ledesma
DIIV
TV Ghost

, Exercising isn't any fun when someone else is there, anyway. Shoot some hoops, or do some aerobics, or do some push-ups and sit-ups. Get moving! Feeling good is fun.

, YouTube is the place where boredom goes to die. There are plenty of communities of people who do weird things and put them on YouTube, and then comment. Common Vlog topics include:


Hauls. When you come back from the grocery store, mall, library, or wherever you go to stock up on something, record a ""haul"" video when you get back, showing off each item for the camera and describing why you purchased it, or borrowed it.
What's in my bag? Record yourself rummaging through your purse or wallet and talking about everything you find there. Let each item launch you off on a weird story or ramble.
How tos. Teach the camera how you put on your make-up every day, or how to play ""Good Riddance"" on guitar. Teach us something we need to know.
Review something. Know everything there is to know about shoes, or heavy metal, or hot sauce? Pick a new variety and review it. Try it out on camera, give us a sample, and then give it however many stars out of five you think it deserves.

, All your friends are busy? Quit feeling sorry for yourself. Go make a new one. Strike up a conversation with someone at a coffee shop or at school. Tell them you're organizing a jailbreak and you need a lieutenant.


Try to learn one interesting fact about a person you've never met before. Strike up a conversation with someone at the bus stop, or in the lunch room at school and try to make a new friend, at least for a minute.

, Look at the bulletin board at your community center, library, or school. Find where strangers meet to talk about their problems. Listen closely without disturbing anyone. You can be courteous of the meeting, but still sit in on it to learn something about people and a community you'd never considered. They're usually free, and quite interesting.


Alternatively, readings, lectures, and church services are all generally free and under-attended events that you might stumble onto to learn something you'd never considered before.

, If you're bored and alone, find some productive way to spend that time doing something for others.


The Humane Society regularly needs people to come and spend time with the animals, taking them for walks and giving them some much-needed attention. If you like animals, you could do a lot worse than hanging out with some that need it.
Check out soup kitchens in your area that accept volunteers and give back to the community.
Many cities and towns have community gardens that need watering. If you've got a green thumb but don't have the space for your own garden, get planting on communal property.

Assemble your materials.,
Prepare your work area.,
Paint your popsicle sticks, if necessary.,
Cut out your trunk.,
Glue together your popsicle sticks.,
Add the star and trunk.,
Glue your tree to the construction paper background.,
Decorate your popsicle stick tree and its background.",How to Make Popsicle Stick Christmas Trees1," You may have many of these materials in your craft cupboard or closet at home, but any supplies you don't have can be bought at most stores. The goal of this project is to make a simple tree and then glue it onto a construction paper background to form the basis for a holiday scene. You'll need:


A gold pom-pom (small to medium size)
Construction paper (any color; 1 medium to large sized sheet)
Construction paper (brown; 1 small to medium sized sheet apiece)
Crayons (or markers, colored pencils, etc.; optional)
Decorations (like gems, beads, and so on)
Drop cloth (or some other surface covering, like newspaper; recommended)
General purpose glue
Green paint (like acrylic) and paintbrush (optional)
Paper plate (for painting; optional)
Pencil
Plastic cup (for painting; optional)
Popsicle sticks (at least 3; pre-colored green sticks preferred)
Ruler
Scissors;
, If you have colored popsicle sticks, you won't have to worry about painting, but you still might want to lay down newspaper or a drop cloth to prevent glue from getting on your work surface. If your sticks aren't yet green, you'll definitely want to cover your work surface to prevent paint from getting on it.


If painting, take this time to also fill your plastic cup a third of the way with water. Then squeeze some of your green paint onto a paper plate.
Small children have a tendency to get paint on their clothing. To prevent this from happening, you might want to have children wear a smock when painting.

, Lay out your three popsicle sticks on your work surface. Moisten your paintbrush by dipping it in the water, then release excess water in the brush by pressing it against the inside lip of the cup. Mixing too much water in with your paint can cause it to become runny. Then:


Dip your brush into the paint on your paper plate. Paint each of your three popsicle sticks until they are completely covered in green, front and back.
Wait for the paint to completely dry before moving on in this project. For many kinds of paint, this should only take about one hour.

, While waiting for your paint on your sticks to dry, you can cut out your trunk. Use your ruler and a pencil to measure and mark out a 1"" by 1"" (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square from your brown construction paper. Then use your scissors to cut this square out to create your tree's trunk.


Depending on the size of the popsicle sticks you are using, you may want to adjust the size of your trunk so that the two are proportionate.

, Use a dab of glue to connect both ends of each stick to the other two sticks' ends. This will form a triangle shape. Afterwards, you may want to hold the glued ends down firmly for one to three minutes to encourage a strong bond.Generally, you should allow some time for the glue to set before moving on. For many fast drying glues, 15 to 30 minutes should be sufficient.

, Take your brown construction paper trunk and glue it along one edge. Attach this edge to the middle of the base of your popsicle stick triangle. After that, put a dab of glue on your gold pom-pom and put it at the top of your triangle to form the star of your tree.

, Take your medium to large sized piece of construction paper and glue your popsicle stick tree to it. Now that the background is in place, you or your children can add to it to create a neat holiday scene.

, You can glue gems and beads on your tree to make it appear as though it were draped in lights. You or your kids could also use the popsicle Christmas tree as the basis for a holiday scene. You might:


Add details by drawing on the construction paper background with crayons, colored pencils, markers, and so on.
Cut holiday pictures from magazines and newspapers, then glue these to your background to make a collage.

Collect your supplies.,
Paint your popsicle sticks.,
Arrange the popsicle sticks.,
Measure your tapering effect, if desired.,
Use your scissors to cut the sticks.,
Heat up your glue gun.,
Glue your rows together to form your tree.,
Add accents and decorations to your tree.",How to Make Popsicle Stick Christmas Trees2," These supplies can be found at most grocery stores, general retailers, and craft stores. Additionally, feel free to add embellishments to your Christmas tree when decorating it. For this project, you'll need:


Buttons
Drop cloth (or similar work surface cover)
Green paint (acrylic recommended)
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Pain brush
Paper plate
Paper/plastic cup
Pencil
Popsicle sticks
Ruler
Scissors (sturdy ones preferred)
Twine (or yarn; about 6 inches)

, Fill your paper or plastic cup with water. Then lay out about a dozen popsicle sticks on your work surface. Squirt some paint onto your paper plate, moisten your brush in water, dip it into the paint, and paint your sticks so they are completely green on both sides.


Too much water in your brush can make your paint watery and thin. Press your brush against the inside upper lip of your cup to remove excess moisture.
After painting, you'll have to wait for the paint to completely dry. Depending on the paint you have used, dry times will vary, but in many cases the paint will be dry in about an hour.
Use a drop cloth, newspapers, cardboard, and so on to cover your work surface and prevent paint from spreading to it or your home.
You may want to dress young children in smocks to prevent paint from accidentally getting on their clothes (or spreading elsewhere).

, Take your painted sticks and arrange them so they are positioned lengthwise, left-to-right, in front of you in rows. There should be no spaces between sticks, and each stick should form a single row.


The number of rows of popsicle sticks will determine the size of your tree. You could use 11 sticks in a row to make a single large tree, or you could make two groups of 5 sticks in a row to make two smaller trees.
At least one popsicle stick should be kept separate from the rest. This will form the trunk. If making two trees from your 12 sticks, you'll need to set aside two sticks for trunks, and so on.
Starting from the stick closest to you, you are going to cut the rows of sticks to create a tapering shape that narrows as it moves away from you, like a triangle with its base facing you. This will be the body of the tree.

, The appeal of this particular popsicle Christmas tree is its rough, irregular appearance. For this reason, you may want to free-hand when cutting your popsicle sticks to create a tapering effect in your stick rows. For a more regular tapering effect:


Take your ruler and measure the stick row that is farthest away from you. Measure it end to end, lengthwise, then use a pencil to mark its center.
Lay your ruler so it forms an angle between the mark at the middle of the farthest row and the leftmost end of the row closest to you. Draw along this line a pencil.
Draw the same angle reflected on the other side of the sticks. The line you draw will run between the mark at the middle of the farthest row and the rightmost end of the row closest to you.
Starting from the middle mark of the farthest row and moving toward the base, where your angled lines cross onto a new stick row, draw a line straight down across the middle of each stick. This should create a guideline shaped like a stair step.

, Normal scissors may not be able to cut through the popsicle sticks easily. A sturdy pair of heavy duty ones or cutting shears will work best. Cut the ends of your sticks along the guidelines you have drawn so that the rows of sticks shorten with each row that moves away from you.


If you find that your scissors aren't effective, place a cutting mat or cardboard beneath the sticks, then use a utility knife to deeply score the sticks along the guidelines. Bend these to break off the ends and create your tapering row effect.

, Insert the glue into the top feeder slot in the gun and plug it in. Place a piece of scrap paper or card stock beneath the gun's nozzle to catch any drips. Most hot glue guns heat up in about 5 minutes, though depending on your model, this may take more or less time.


Most hot glue guns have a foldable arm that is used to keep the gun propped up. This encourages good glue flow., Take your hot glue gun and put a dab of glue ¾ of the way to one end of the trunk popsicle stick that you kept separate from the popsicle stick rows. Attach the ends of your twine or yarn to the trunk stick with the dab of hot glue. Allow this to dry, then:


Apply a line of hot glue to the length of your trunk stick on the same side you've glued your twine or yarn.
Press your trunk stick to attach it to the tapered rows at the middle of the stick rows. The trunk stick should connect all stick rows.
If you have many stick rows to make a large tree, you may need to chain together several overlapping trunk sticks to connect all stick rows together., You can attach many colorful additions to your tree to make it more festive. By hot gluing many colored buttons on your tree, you can give it an effect that mimics Christmas lights. Some other decorating ideas include:


Using hot glue to attach little bells to your tree.
Applying glitter to your tree to make it look snowy.
Attaching sequins to your tree to make it more glamorous.

Gather your materials.,
Cut the end off of one popsicle stick.,
Cut your designs.,
Prepare your hot glue gun.,

Add your designs.,
Decorate your tree further, if desired.",How to Make Popsicle Stick Christmas Trees3," Most of these materials can be found around your home. Anything you lack can be bought at your local grocery store, general retailer, or craft store. For this project, you'll need:


Card stock (in two colors: brown and glittery silver or gold)
Cutting mat (optional)
Decorations (pom-poms, sparkly pipe cleaner, bells, etc.)
Hot glue gun (and glue)
Pencil (optional)
Popsicle sticks (at least 3; pre-dyed green ones preferred)
Ruler
Scissors
Twine (at least 6"" (15.24 cm) in length)
Utility knife

, Take your ruler and a single popsicle stick. Measure inward from one end of the popsicle stick ¾"" (1.9 cm). At ¾"" (1.9 cm), draw a line with your pencil or use your utility knife to gently score the popsicle stick across its middle. This is where you'll cut to remove the end the stick. After marking:


Use a pair of sturdy scissors to cut the end of the stick off. In some cases, your scissors may not be sturdy enough to cut through the popsicle stick.
If scissors won't work, place a cutting mat or piece of cardboard beneath the popsicle stick. Apply firm pressure with your utility knife to deeply score the stick along the guideline. Bend the stick along the scoring to break it off cleanly., You may want to make a template, like a stencil, and use this to help you draw a star design on your glittery card stock. Stars can be difficult to cut free-hand from your card stock. Then:


Use your pencil to draw a 1"" by 1"" (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square on your brown card stock. This will be glued to your popsicle stick tree to form its trunk.
Cut the trunk free from the card stock with your scissors by following your guidelines., Insert glue into the slot on the top-back of the gun and then plug it in. Some configurations of the glue feeder mechanism may be slightly different. Place a piece of scrap paper under the nozzle of your gun to catch any drippage, then wait about 5 minutes for the gun to heat up.


Depending on your model of hot glue gun and other factors, like its age, your gun may require slightly more or less time than 5 minutes to heat up.
Most hot glue guns have a plastic arm that folds up so the gun stands upright, handled oriented to the table, with a slight downward angle. This helps improve glue flow., Take the popsicle stick you have cut and put two dabs of hot glue on both ends. Attach the two uncut popsicles sticks to it, with each one connecting to the cut one at opposite end. The uncut sticks should at about the midpoint above the cut stick to form a triangle. Then:


Apply a large dab of glue with your hot glue gun to the end of the uncut stick at the bottom of the crossed part.
Take your 6"" (15.2 cm) of twine and insert its ends into the large dab of glue to form a loop with the twine.
Press the uncut stick on the top of the crossed part so it sandwiches the twine and adheres to the uncut stick on the bottom of the cross.
Work quickly when applying hot glue, as it dries fast. Once it is dry, it will lose its adhesive properties and become thick and hard., Use your hot glue gun to apply a dab of glue to the center of the back of your star. Glue the star to the top of your tree, where the uncut sticks cross. Then:


Take your 1"" by 1"" (2.5 cm by 2.5 cm) square and apply a dab of hot glue at the middle of one edge of the square.
Attach your square to the cut stick at the middle of the base of your tree.

, You could coil your tree in sparkly pipe cleaner to give it the effect of being decorated with tinsel. By adding small, colorful pom-poms to your tree with your hot glue gun, you can give the impression that your popsicle stick tree has Christmas lights.


For more creative or colorful designs, you might add rhinestones, glitter, sequins, and so on.
You can repurpose items, like buttons or small bells, and hot glue these to your popsicle sticks to give your tree a nifty, unique appearance.
Once the finishing touches are complete and the glue is dry, hang your Christmas tree from a door handle to show off your (or your kids') handiwork.

Enjoy the rain.",How to Have Fun on a Rainy Day1," One of the best ways to keep busy during a rainy day is to cook. This keeps you busy and lets you use some of those ingredients in your pantry you've been wanting to try. The best part is that you end up with a tasty result at the end that everyone can enjoy!


Make comfort food like chocolate chip cookies, or try a fancy cupcake recipe you found online. Try making bread from scratch.Find an old family recipe and try to make it. If you have kids, teach them how to make grandma's famous biscuits or your treasured apple pie recipe.
Try making an ethnic dish you've never tried before. Go outside of your comfort zone and have fun in the kitchen.;
, A rainy day is a great time to get caught up on your knitting or crocheting projects. Maybe you might also want to sew that dress or pair of pants you've been wanting.


Find a tutorial online that teaches you how to knit, crochet, or sew. Spend the day learning if you've never done these things before. Find a fun pattern and create a gift for someone.
There are many things to knit or crochet: finger puppets, blankets, hats, small animals, scarves, and so much more.

, Spend those rainy days engrossed in a good book. Reading is a great way to go on an adventure without having to leave your house. Find a book on your bookshelf, go to the library, or download a book onto your electronic reader.


No matter what your interests, there is a book for you. Do you like western adventure novels? Romance? History? Suspense? Horror? You might have to spend a few minutes looking at dust jackets or summaries, but you can find the book for you.
If you feel adventurous, just pick a random book off the shelf and start reading. You might surprise yourself with liking something you never thought you would.
If you've seen a movie adaptation lately, read the book the movie was based on.
Catch up on your classics. Pick up a book you've always wanted to read but never had the time to.

, Open up your imagination and write a story. Find the idea of your story and start writing. Have fun with it as you create your own world.


Write a fictionalized version of something that happened to you. Write a scary story or a romance story. Push yourself outside of your comfort zone and try to write something in a genre you've never thought about writing in before.
If you're not a writer, try drawing or painting a picture instead.

, Cleaning is something we always promise ourselves we'll do, but sometimes we ignore that because of our busy lives. What better way to use a rainy day than by doing chores? Clean and organize the parts of your house that really need maintenance. This way, you won’t have cleaning and organizing to worry about when the sunny weather returns.


Pick a room to tackle. Or go methodically from room to room.
Work on some projects you never seem to have time for. Clean out your closets, organize the pantry, or clean out the garage. Gather clothes and items to donate to charity. Vacuum, wash the windows, and clean the bathtub.

, If you're not scared to get wet, take an umbrella with you and go for a nice long walk. Walk to a park near your house or visit a friend who doesn’t live right around the corner. Take in the different way the world looks around you in the rain.Visit a local state park or wildlife reserve. If you live in the city, take a tour around the city with an umbrella.One advantage rainy days have is that less people will be out. You can have a nice walk and explore some local sites without crowds of people around.Rainy days also give you an opportunity to wear your rainy day clothes. Don that trench coat you never wear and the boots gathering dust in your closet.Being outside for a while and moving helps makes you feel like you did something useful with your day.
If you're into photography, make sure to take your camera along - you might get some inspiration along the way!

, Gather friends and family together and host a movie marathon. Choose classics the kids haven't seen, rent a bunch of new releases, or rewatch favorites.Have a rainy day theme with films featuring rain, storms, or the word rain, like Singing in the Rain.
Choose a genre and watch a bunch of movies from it. Have an action-packed day, scare yourself with horror movies, or have a laugh with some classic comedies.
Instead of a movie marathon, try a TV show marathon. Pick a TV show you've been wanting to watch, or catch up on shows you haven't had a chance to watch because you've been busy.

, Gather your family, invite your friends, and sit around the table to play board games and card games.This is a great way to catch up with your loved ones, talk, laugh, and enjoy being together.


Try strategy games like Risk, Settlers of Catan, or Ticket to Ride. Play classic games like Monopoly, Scrabble, Clue, or Life. If you have enough people, play Spades, Euchre, or Whisk. For larger groups, try Poker, Phase 10, or Skip Bo.
Get caught up on your video games. This is great if you are alone. Invite your best friend over and play some video games together, or get online and play with people online.

, Sit out on your porch or balcony with a mug of hot chocolate, tea, or coffee. Listen to the sound of the rain and watch it as it falls. Take the time to relax and focus on the weather instead of life.

Learn to play a musical instrument.
Take up singing or dancing.
Try a new art form like photography or knitting.;
, In most places, summer is a great time of year for outdoor sports, as long as you can stand the heat. If you don't have a favorite sport yet, there's no better time to pick one up.


Get friends together or join a class to play team sports such as soccer (association football), basketball, or field hockey.
Find an activity for one or two people, like surfing, urban golf, or tennis.

, Get some friends over and brainstorm a movie idea. This can be anything from a science fiction story, to a competitive cooking show, to a music video. If you get into the project, it can provide weeks of fun planning a storyboard, costumes, recruiting extras, and editing the film.


You could also come up with an idea for a series of smaller videos, and start a Youtube channel.

, Get a recording program or a tape recorder and start your own show. Write up a list of things you want to include on your show: music, jokes, interviews, advertisements, fake or genuine news commentary, etc.

, Arts and crafts projects can take time and patience you don't have during the school year, but they're perfect for summertime. Here are some ideas:



Fold a paper heart. You can cut out heart-shaped notes for your loved ones, or get some square origami paper and try to make a fancier version. There are many more origami projects to try as well.

Make rainbow crayons, or try melting crayons on hot rocks to make art.

Make your own slime or play dough. Use these strange-feeling materials for pranks, or just to play with for fun.

Make a Solar Hot Air Balloon. These balloons can travel hundreds of miles in a day, and are easy to make.

, There are more games out there than you could ever learn in a lifetime, but summer gives you the opportunity to pick one and become a master strategist. Some games like bridge, chess, Magic, or Starcraft II even have international tournaments with massive rewards for the winners.

, If you don't know how to cook or you don't know much about food, you could learn some recipes now. There are thousands of recipes available online or in cookbooks from the library or bookstores, or you could try these easy ideas to start with:



Make cold, refreshing smoothies. Try different, even wacky combinations, either to make a nice cold summer drink, or to dare your friends to drink a mysterious concoction.

Make a chocolate peanut butter parfait as a delicious dessert.

Make hummus for dipping crackers. If you're ambitious, you could even make homemade bread.

, It'll keep you busy, introduce you to new people, and earn some money. Many retail businesses, tourist attractions, or summer festivals need workers during the summer.

, Helping your community can be satisfying, uplifting work, and of course you're working towards a good cause of well. Look for organization in your area that pick up trash, work with injured or abandoned animals, or work for political causes.


Volunteering also looks good on college applications, although interviews and essay will go a lot better if you are genuinely interested in the work.

, Books can transport you into a different world, or let you see through the eyes of others. Try learning all you can on a particular topic, such as Norse mythology, Japanese history, or space travel.


If you want to learn even more, try an online college course. Some of the world's top universities even post lectures online, and these are often more interesting than a high school (secondary school) classes., Many people keep journals to reflect on their day, work through hard times, or write down their plans for the upcoming day. Maybe, in a few years, you'll read it again and smile at your summer memories.

, This is a huge project, that could fill your entire summer and more if you get inspired. If you're not sure where to begin, try writing a story imitating your favorite author, or work together with a friend so you can trade ideas.

, Knowing a foreign language can lead to many opportunities, not to mention it looks good on college applications. Get started by finding a beginner's class nearby, or ask a friend or family member to teach you a language they know. Search online for free language lessons, online learning tools, or foreign conversation partners.

, Most areas host fairs, festivals, carnivals, or other fun events during the summer. Check your city's calendar online, or ask other people in the area whether they've heard of events. Check the websites or advertisements for nearby venues, including concert locations, theaters, and sports stadiums.

, Look at your town's or region's tourism website or brochures advertising events and find out what attracts people traveling from other locations. There might be anything from museums to merry go rounds lurking in your town, or in areas a short drive away., Spend a couple days with friends or family at a campsite, or camp in your backyard. Gather friends around a campfire or barbecue to tell scary stories and make s'mores.

, Find a geocaching site online, and look up locations near you to see if anyone has hidden secret rewards. You can search for these caches or hide your own wither with a GPS unit or by finding the coordinates on a map.

, If weather, transportation, or a lack of events prevents you from leaving the house, take a fake vacation. Invite a couple friends for a sleepover and decorate your room like a palace, jungle, hotel, or anything you like. Go shopping for unusual foods and ""souvenirs"" to share with your guests. If the weather is rainy, dress up in swimsuits and sunglasses and lounge around indoors pretending you're visiting a location with a proper summer.

, If your current friends are out of town or busy, look through your old yearbooks, phone contacts, or emails and reconnect with people you used to know. Any of the activities above can be more fun with friends, or you can simply spend an afternoon catching up with each other or reminiscing.

, If you live in an area where summers are hot, you can have fun and cool off at the same time. Visit the beach or the pool with friends or family. Play swimming games like Marco Polo or Shark Attack, hold swimming races, or get a group of friends together to play water polo.

, Even if you don't have anywhere to swim, you might find ways to have fun with water. Put on a swimsuit or light clothes you don't mind getting wet, and find some overheated friends to join you in these activities:


Turn on the sprinklers on a lawn and play tag, hide-and-go-seek, or red rover in the middle of the spraying water.
Have a water fight. Fill up some water balloons, buy a cheap water gun at the dollar store, or use a garden hose. This can be a fun one-time activity... or the start of a water fight war.

, A cold beverage or a bowl of ice cream can be wonderful in hot weather. Making them yourself is even better for curing boredom.


Try making homemade ice cream, either with the classic ""salt and ice"" method or with a method that recreates the creamy, rich taste of real ice cream.

Make popsicles and keep your freezer stocked all summer.
Fill your fridge with homemade ginger ale or lemonade.
Make a ice lick. Place cold water in a cup with a disposable straw or spoon. Keep it in the freezer for 2 hours, then take it out and eat it while it's cold and yummy.

, Find a cool, shady room, or make a blanket fort out of light sheets to create a refuge from the sun. Turn on a fan, find a book to read, and wait for the hottest part of the day to pass.


Other relaxed indoor activities include sewing, playing solitaire or other card games, watching a movie, or listening to music.

, As dusk starts to fall and the temperatures cool off, gather a group of friends to play games like hide-and-seek, sardines, freeze tag or capture the flag in a large yard or park. If the evening is still too hot for physical activity, set up a table outside and play card games or board games while the air cools down.


Pick a board game that won't be blown away by wind, such as Carcassonne, Tikal, or Blokus.These are all moderately popular games sold at many game stores, but classics like Chess, Checkers, or any board game's magnetic travel version are even easier to find.
A trick-taking card game like Hearts can be played in windy areas, as long as you have rocks or other heavy objects to hold down the tricks.

, Some people like this activity more than others, but even if you're not much of a decorator it beats sitting around doing nothing. Even just sorting through old clutter can help you find old toys, books, and other nostalgic objects. For a larger project, paint your room or hang up posters and pictures..

, See how many kinds of different wild flowers you can find in your yard or nearby fields. Make a bouquet, or press them to make permanent decorations. Leaves can also be dried to use in art projects or just to keep around as decoration.


Don't pick flowers from other people's yards without permission, or if the flowers look intentionally planted.

, There are hundreds of natural DIY recipes, using yogurt, avocado, or other natural ingredients. Open up your cupboards and treat yourself to a cheap spa day.

, Sort through your clothes, and pick out the ones that you don't want/are too small for you. Invite some friends over, and ask them to bring some clothes/other items they don't want. Trade clothes with each other, or sell them at a yard sale to raise some spending money.

Play board games.,
Play mentally stimulating games.,
Play card games.,
Play mind games.",How to Overcome Boredom During the Holidays1," There are likely to be board games in the family home or at your friend's house. You can stick to the tried and true ones like Monopoly, Clue, or Snakes and Ladders. Or you can get more deeply involved in role playing or strategy games, like Agricola, Carcassonne, Puerto Rico or Settlers of Catan.


Some of the more famous board games are now available for playing on the iPad. This can be useful if you can't find the real board game at home––simply download the game (such as Monopoly), place the iPad down on a table you can all sit around and begin to play. You can pause for breaks and even come back another day, all without losing your places!;
, Games like Pente, Blokus, chess and Quoridor will have you thinking strategy and pitting your wits against your opponent. You won't have time to notice boredom anymore.

, There are many card games, from solitaire, poker and Bohnanza, Tichu or Pit.

, No, not the sort in which you wind up Aunt Matilda until she finally explodes. Rather, this is the sort of mind games mentalists engage in. For example:


Observe the people around you and try to work out what they're thinking and what sort of holiday experience they're having. Can you read their emotions from their body language alone?
Cold read. Choose someone as bored as you and offer to read their mind. Of course, you'll need to focus on something you don't know about the other person, so a friend you haven't seen for a while or a more distant relative might be better choices than someone close.
Make someone say something without realizing you're manipulating them. For example, see How to make someone say carrot by way of example.

Create fun outfits.,
Make jewelry.,
Create crafts from paper.,
Create a basic science experiment.,
Write a story or poem.",How to Have Fun While Home Alone (Teen Girls)1," Don't think of it as ""dress up."" Think of it as creating new outfits that scream ""you!"" Play around with your clothing, trying out different items in ways you don't normally wear them. You can even put on some music and have a mini fashion show once you get some looks you like.Try some new accessories, or layer clothing you don't normally layer. Add scarves, and try tying them in creative ways. You can even tie large scarves into summer shirts!
You could also try mixing and matching clothing with a sibling or a parent. Just make sure you're not doing it without their permission. Ask them before they leave the house.;
, If you've got beads and things to make jewelry, haul it all out. No one's around to tell you you're making a mess or in the way. Use the internet to come up with some new designs or stick to making your own amazing creations.If you don't have beads already, you can make your own from magazines. Simply cut strips into long triangles, then roll them over a toothpick, gluing as you go.
Another way to make beads is to start with a round plastic bottle with no ridges. Cut off the top and bottom, and then slit it down the side. Cut 5-inch strips of plastic in horizontal lines from the top. The width you cut is the width of the bead.
Color on the strip with permanent marker in whatever design you want. Use needle-nose pliers (pliers with a skinny tip) to grab one end of the strip, and then wrap the strip around itself, creating a bead shape. Trap the other end with the needle-nose pliers, and then heat up the bead with a hair dryer on hot, turning the bead to heat the whole thing.
Be careful, the bead will be hot. You can use another pair of pliers to turn it or wait until it cools. Once the bead is sealed, it's done.Just be sure to clean up the mess before your parents get home!

, If you've got glue or tape, paper, markers, and scissors, you can create an unlimited number of crafty things. Try making a card for a friend, or creating a scrapbook page with printed out photos. You could also make bookmarks or try your hand at origami.To make a simple card, fold a piece of card stock or brightly colored paper in half. Decorate the front with drawings, or cut out shapes in other colors. Glue or tape them on to create a design.

, Science can be fun, especially when you use things you already have around your house. You can find any number of experiments on the internet to try at home, and you won't even realize you're learning something interesting about the world.


For instance, try making a hoop glider. You'll need an index card or some other type of stiff paper, as well as a straight straw and some tape. Cut the card into 3 pieces. Each piece should be an inch long by 5 inches long. Curl the first strip into a loop, overlapping the edges. Tape it together. Make a larger loop with the other two pieces, by overlapping the edges and taping them together.
Tape the small loop on one end the straw, with the straw inside the loop. Tape the other loop on the other end, once again with the straw inside the loop. Hold the straw at the bottom with the loops up, and toss it across the room like a paper airplane.To get into the experimental mood, try other configurations. Will a stir stick work as well as a straw? What about different size loops? What if you move the hoops around on the straw? What happens?

, If you've never tried your hand at writing much, now's as good a time as any to try. If you don't know where to get started, think about some of your favorite stories. What do you like about them? Maybe the story has a great main character or the plot is really interesting and action-packed. If you know what kind of stories you like, it can help you when you start writing.For poems, try a descriptive poem. Think about a really good memory. What made it good? Use all your senses to describe the day. Also, don't be afraid to use similes or metaphors.
Similes and metaphors are when you describe one thing by comparing it to something else that is seemingly different on the outside. Similes use ""like"" or ""as,"" while metaphors don't. For instance, if you wanted to describe the sun, you could say, ""The sun was like a giant yolk in the sky,"" which is a simile comparing the sun to an egg yolk. A metaphor would be ""The sun was a giant yolk in the sky,"" since it doesn't use ""like"" or ""as.""

"
If you have a day or more clear, now is a good time to get stuck into a project of choice.",How to Overcome Boredom During the Holidays2," Whether you're crafty, handy with wood, crazy about it or itching to cook something, you can choose a distinct project to start and perhaps even finish within the holiday time. Make a slideshow, bake a cake, make a paper mâché, write a play. Your project might even involve redesigning your room or house, planning a trip overseas or creating a budget to follow.


Now is a good time to focus on a few things you've been putting off, like cleaning out the eaves, putting your tax receipts in order or de-fleaing the cat. Doing something constructive is always more effective than sitting about focusing on how bored you're feeling.

"
"
Organize a party.",How to Overcome Boredom During the Holidays3," If you're missing the party atmosphere, rev it up again by throwing your own. You don't really need an excuse––too much leftover food is probably good enough a reason! Some ideas for throwing a party include:


Have a sleepover. This is great for kids and teens but there's no reason why you can't invite your best adult pal from one town over for a sleepover, gossip catch-up together too!
Throw a ""finish-my-leftover-alcohol"" cocktail party. All those half and quarter empty bottles of grog left from the season's parties can be turned into a cocktail-making parties for your friends (obviously, drinking age only). Leave the bottles out on a table along with some cocktail making books or web pages to check and let your friends make their own crazy concoctions.
A picnic. Whether you're talking holiday season during summer or winter, a picnic is always a possibility to get everyone out of the house. Just be sure to rug up well if it's wintertime and look for warm spots or heated shelters.
Re-gifting party. If you have a bunch of friends who received gifts that they didn't much like, get together to re-gift. Just make sure that nobody re-gifts gifts from within the group of friends attending! Not for everyone but a bit of fun for those willing to give it a go.

Throw out clothes you haven't worn for a long time. Give them to a charity.

Make a facial scrub.,
Give yourself a pedicure or manicure.,
Take a long bath.,
Play with your hair.",How to Have Fun While Home Alone (Teen Girls)2," All you need for a facial scrub is some cooking oil, sugar, and a bit of salt. Olive oil is a good choice, but coconut oil would work fine if you melt it in the microwave a little. Sea salt is also better than regular salt. Mix a tablespoon or two with enough sugar and a dash or two of salt to make thick concoction.If you heat the coconut oil, make sure to test it first so you don't put hot oil on your face. Use a pinky to test it.
To use the facial scrub, rub it on your face in gentle circles, avoiding your eyes.
Don't rub for longer than a minute or two, as you don't want to take too much skin off. When you're done, simply wash it off.
Making face masks can also be a fun thing to do!

, You could also spend some time giving yourself a fun new color on your nails.

Wipe up any spills right away.

, Another way to pamper yourself is to take a long bath by yourself with some nice music on. You could also put on an audio book. The point is to choose something that you find relaxing and enjoyable, and then let yourself soak in the warmth. Pick a candle in a soothing scent like lavender or jasmine or even use bath salts in one of those scents.

You can also just pick a scent you enjoy.

Add in some bubble bath for extra fun.

, Spend some time trying some new tricks with your hair. Try a fun updo, or create some crazy curls with your curling iron.

Gather a small portion of your hair at the top of your head. Divide it into 3 equal parts. Pull the right piece over the middle piece, making it the middle piece. Then pull the left one over the middle piece, making it the middle piece.
Now, add a little bit of your loose hair to each of the sections. For instance, gather a bit of hair starting near you left ear, and pull it into the left section. Pull from the middle for the middle section, and the right for the right section. Make sure you're gathering hair evenly.
Repeat the process, braiding and adding hair until you reach your neck, where you should add any remaining hair and continue braiding. Use a hair tie to hold it together.

Try yoga.,
Try learning a jump-rope routine.,
Challenge yourself to a plank contest.",How to Have Fun While Home Alone (Teen Girls)3," When you're home alone, no one's around to be bothered by your music. Take the opportunity to turn it up loud (but not loud enough to disturb any neighbors), and dance your heart away. Try copying some of your favorite celebrity's dance moves or make up your own.You could also get out a video dance game since no one will be around to laugh at your moves.

, If you've never done yoga, try looking up a few moves to try on your own. You don't want to start with anything too complicated. Stick to some basic, so it'll be easy to learn and you won't hurt yourself. You can look up videos of how to do basic moves on the internet.Try a standing forward fold. Place your feet about shoulder-width. Place your arms folded over the top of your head, with each hand grabbing the other arm near the elbow. Bend over at the waist, going as far forward as you feel comfortable doing. Hold the position for a minute or two before moving on to another one. You can bend your knees a little if it helps.Move into downward-facing dog. You can easily move from a standing forward fold to downward-facing dog. All you need to do is put your hands flat on the ground in front of you. Your arms should end up straight. As you move into this position, move your feet back. Your legs should also be straight. You should basically make an ""A"" shape with your body. Hold this position for a minute or two.Go into warrior I pose. From downward-facing dog, step forward with your right leg, bringing it between your arms. Turn your left leg in a bit as you lift your torso up until it is straight above your legs. Push your hands into the air above your head, reaching up., You may think jumping rope is just for kids, but it can be a lot of fun even for teenagers like yourself. You just have to make it a little harder for yourself then you did when you were a kid. Also, it will really get your heart pumping, and it's fun to jump in rhythm to an upbeat song.

Once you get a rhythm going, trying jumping on just one foot, then switching to the other. You could also try alternating feet.
Another option is criss-crossing. Cross your arms in front of yourself as you jump, still bringing the rope under you.
You could also try double turning the rope. That is, jump higher, and try to get the rope under you twice.
Make sure you have enough room when jumping, as you need a lot of space. Also, be careful, as whipping the rope around can cause hurt if it hits your skin.

, Planking is all the rage now. You've probably challenged your friends to planking contests. It can be just as fun to challenge yourself to a contest. Get into a plank, and time your plank.

Rest your upper body on your forearms.
To do a proper plank, keep your body as straight as possible. Lifting your middle up makes it easier, but it's not a true plank. However, don't worry if you need to start with an easier position. You can always work into a harder plank later.

Visit the local tourist spots in your own town. Sometimes when you live in a town, you get caught up in the daily grind and don't see everything it has to offer.
