Research ways to make money from home.,
Learn a new language.,
Catch up with an old friend.,
Create a budget.,
Look up ways to volunteer.",How to Alleviate Boredom at Home3," If you don't have a regular job and are looking to earn some extra income, there are a lot of different avenues online to make some cash. You can sell items you have made on Etsy, make some money taking online surveys, or do freelance writing or editing., While this seems like a difficult task to do on your own, there are a lot of resources that can help you get started learning a new language. You can purchase software like Rosetta Stone, visit a website like Memrise, or you can download a free app like Duolingo., You have lots of time on your hands so why not call up that old friend you've been meaning to chat with? If it's during the day and they aren't available, you can always shoot them an email or write them an old fashioned letter.


Because letter writing is few and far between, sometimes it can be really exciting to receive a handwritten letter -- and it shows thoughtfulness because it takes more effort than sending someone a text.
You can also send them a postcard.

, While you are organizing your home, why not organize your finances as well? Creating a budget can seem constricting to some, but having an idea where your money is going can be freeing and stress relieving. Come up with some common categories like rent, food, gas, miscellaneous, etc. and apportion the amount of money you usually spend on each of these things to those categories.


If you are unsure how much money should go in each category, look at your bank statement from the past two months and see how much you spent on each category. You can also find budget helpers online if you need some more ideas for different categories or how to apportion your funds.

, If you constantly have extended time on your hands, this is a great way to use it -- by helping others out. You can usually find a lot of volunteer opportunities just by researching online. Maybe you like working with animals or the elderly, or you'd rather volunteer to promote the arts. Either way, there are likely some opportunities in your area to spend your time helping others.Volunteer at your local animal shelter.
Serve at a nursing home.
Pick up trash on the road.

Write a to do list.,
Deep clean your house.,
Reorganize your closet.,
Reorganize your books.,
Get rid of old things.,
Do laundry.,
Organize different rooms.",How to Alleviate Boredom at Home4," Take time to think through everything you'd like to get done around the house, whether that's cleaning, organizing, or other household tasks. Then, go down the list and check off things as you do them. It can feel great to check things off a list that have been piling up for days or weeks.

, Cleaning often gets neglected when busyness takes over, so it's possible that your home could use a really good, deep cleaning. Start by straightening up your home, putting things into their places, and then bring out the heavy duty cleaning supplies. Give your bathroom and kitchen a heavy scrub down, vacuum and dust the living room and bedrooms, and sweep and mop your floors.Depending on how dirty your home is, these tasks could take an entire day! If your place is really dirty, don't overwhelm yourself by trying to get it done all at once. Spend a few hours cleaning, and then reward yourself with a break while doing something fun.

, Another way to pass your time is to clean out your closet and organize its contents. Rearrange your clothes in order of season and color, and arrange your shoes by style and color. This is also a good time to clean out any junk or random items that you have stored in your closet that don't belong there or could have a better place to stay.


As you are organizing your closet, this could be a good time to get rid of clothes you don't wear anymore or that don't fit anymore. A good way to figure out how often you wear something is to turn the hangers of all of your clothes backwards, and then when you wear that piece of clothing turn it the right direction. Then, after a few months you should see which clothes you haven't worn.

, If you have a large collection of books, and it's difficult to find the book you are looking for, take time on this day to organize your books. You can organize them by author, title, or genre. This is also a good time to get rid of old books you won't read again or copies of books, as well as to dust your bookshelves, as you'll be moving books off the shelves to rearrange them.

, As you are cleaning and reorganizing things, create a pile with things that you don't use or want anymore to give to Goodwill, donate to a friend, or have a garage sale. Along with clothes and books, go through any furniture, supplies, or other items around your house and donate or sell the things that you think could benefit someone else.

, Laundry often piles up, just like dirt around the house, and a day where you have nothing to do is a great time to knock out a few loads. Separate your laundry by colors if you like, and afterwards you can even take time to iron items if necessary.

, As you go through each room to clean it, why not organize it as well? Clean out your fridge and throw away old leftovers, organize the pots and pans in your kitchen, rearrange the items under your bathroom sink, etc. There's bound to be many areas in your home that could use some reorganization, so take some time on this day to organize and restructure your life. It will likely help remove any stress that you are feeling too!

Do some basic research on Lladro.,

Invest in a collector's guide.,
Look through the current catalog.,
Search retail and auction websites to determine the current price.,
Sell at a local venue.,
Find a dealer.,
Use an online auction website.,
Find out about becoming an authorized retailer.,
Include the basic information in your title.,
Provide pictures.,
Describe the item in further detail when appropriate.,
Set your price.,
Wait for the sale.",How to Sell Lladro," If you only have one Lladro piece to sell, extensive research won't be necessary. On the other hand, if you have a large collection of pieces to sell, you should probably do some research regarding the various finishes and trademarks used for certain Lladro pieces.


Focus your research on information that will allow you to verify the authenticity of each piece. For instance, most Lladro pieces are marked with the company's bellflower trademark, but some older pieces may not have it.;
, Get as much detail as possible. At minimum, you should know the piece number and name of the piece.If you still have the original packaging, both the piece number and name should be on it. In rare instances, this information may also be printed on the base of the piece.
When possible, you should also find out the date the piece was originally issued and, when appropriate, the date it was retired. Identify the sculptor, too.

, Anyone who wants to sell a large volume of Lladro porcelain should invest in a recent edition of an identification and price guide.


Find the most recent guide possible and look for one focused in your native currency. For instance, if you live in the United States, choose a guide that lists each value in U.S. dollars.
If possible, choose an edition that is only one or two years old. Information will be too outdated in any version older than that.

, A catalog of active Lladro pieces can be found on the company's official website. If the piece you want to sell is part of an active collection, the current retail price of that piece should be available through the Lladro catalog.


You can also find out other information, like issue date or product specifics, via the catalog.
The current Lladro catalog is available online: http://www.lladro.com/collections/temas-LLADRO_BY_THEME/


, ""Value"" is a somewhat subjective term. You'll need to research the various listed values for a specific piece and determine the true sale value through comparison.


Retail value refers to the price an official retailer would charge for a piece. Replacement value refers to the amount of money a piece can be insured for. Auction value refers to the amount of money you should theoretically be able to sell the piece for at an auction.
The price you can sell an item for will usually come closest to auction value, but it can still be a little above or below this value.
Keep in mind that as an individual seller, you will not be able to sell a piece for as much money as an authorized seller might., Local venues include any location that allows you to sell a piece in person. These options are best when you don't expect or intend to make much money from your sales.Common local venues include garage sales, yard sales, want ads, flea markets, and swap meets.
When someone attends a garage or yard sale, they usually expect prices to be low. If you need to make money quickly or have pieces that cannot be priced high, this option could still be worth considering.
Want ads allow you to target serious buyers, but the cost of placing an ad may not be worth it if you advertise in a small newspaper. A better option would be to place an ad on a free classifieds website.
Target high end flea markets and swap meets if you want to sell to serious buyers and make more money. Be aware, however, that you will usually need to pay to sell at these venues.

, Lladro dealers, including both authorized and unauthorized retailers, may buy Lladro pieces from you if the piece is valuable enough and in good enough condition.


A dealer will seek to purchase the figure from you at a lower price so that he or she can turn around and sell it to another buyer at a higher price. If the retailer does not believe this to be possible, he or she probably won't want to buy your piece.
You can find both unauthorized and authorized retailers. Lladro itself does not take part in this resale process, but the company's website does provide a list of authorized retailers that do:http://www.lladro.com/porcelain/faq_mercado/detallistas.pdf


, The most common way to sell individual Lladro pieces is through online auctions. You can either go through a large auction website, like eBay, or look for one that specializes in Lladro and other porcelain figures.


For best results, set a reserve price when you list an item. This will prevent the item from being sold for a value that is too low.
It will cost you money to use an online auction service. Expect to pay a listing fee as well as a commission fee.

, If you have a large number of Lladro to sell and want to establish a store front or online shop, you might be able to qualify as a Lladro Authorized Retailer.


Lladro's commercial organization is divided into territories, each of which falls under a branch company.
Contact the Customer Service Department based in your location with the complete address of your point of sale. Your request will then be forwarded to the commercial manager of your regional area and handled from there.To find the phone number or e-mail address of your Customer Service Department, check the official listing: http://www.lladro.com/services/contacto.jhtml


, When listing or posting your stock, you'll need to describe each piece quickly yet precisely. Provide the piece number, piece name, and any key facts in the product title.


If you are selling through a website or venue that sells other items, as well, you should preface the entire listing with the term ""Lladro.""
When listing the piece number, ignore the leading digits (010 or 0100) and stick with the pieces that are unique to the finish of the item.
Use the exact name. When selling to an English speaking audience, write the English version of the name, not the Spanish version. Do not make up a name that you believe to be descriptive; you must use the original name given by Lladro.
Key facts refer to any important information specific to the piece you're selling. For example, if it is damaged, mark ""Damaged."" If it has been professionally restored, mark ""Restored."" If it's in new condition, mark ""Perfect"" or ""Like New.""

, When you sell online instead of selling in person, you need to take multiple photographs so that the seller knows exactly what to expect.


Use photographs of the actual piece you want to sell. Do not use a stock photo.
Take pictures from multiple angles. Include close-ups of any delicate details on the piece.
Provide a picture of the base, as well. Make sure that this photo shows the Lladro bellflower trademark and any other identifying marks.
Verify that there are no heavy shadows or reflections before using a particular photo. The colors should also be true to the actual piece.

, Depending on the selling venue, you may or may not be asked to provide a full description of the piece. Restate the basic information provided in your title before elaborating further.


Mention whether the finish is glass or matte.
Indicate whether or not the piece comes in its original packaging.
Provide any other technical details not mentioned in the title. This includes issue date, retirement date, and sculptor name.
Describe the full condition of the piece. Include any key details about ownership history. For instance, mention whether it has ever been damaged, if it stayed in its box for years, and details of that nature.
If there is no bellflower trademark due to age or other issues, indicate why this is the case and verify the authenticity of the piece in another way.

, Simply put, the price you set should be the maximum price you expect someone to be willing to pay for the piece.


Keep the commercial value of each piece in mind when setting your own price, but don't lock yourself into it.
Rare pieces tend to sell for a higher price than pieces that are easy to find. Older pieces also tend to have more value than more recent ones. While these two points are often true, however, there are also times when a certain piece will break these rules.
Consider your potential buyers, as well. Serious collectors will pay more than the average customer browsing at a yard sale.
Also pay attention to your time frame. If you want to sell a piece quickly, you will need to price it down. If you are not restricted by time, you can afford to set the price higher and wait it out.

, After you set your price and actually put the Lladro piece up for sale, you need to wait until someone comes along who is willing to buy it. You can advertise your item, but ultimately, this part of the process involves a lot of inactive waiting.


If your piece doesn't sell, reconsider your approach. Ask yourself if a different selling venue might be better or if you need to drop the price.
When you do make a sale, take great care packaging and/or shipping the newly purchased item. If the Lladro figure breaks during shipping, you may need to return the money. If you don't offer a refund, your reputation might be hurt, making it more difficult to sell future pieces.

Create the proper environment for your autographed baseball.",How to Preserve an Autograph on a Baseball," After receiving an autograph on a baseball, make sure nothing touches the ink for at least 1 hour.;
, Repeatedly touching, gripping and handling your signed baseball can result in smearing the ink of the autograph, even after it has dried. Oil emitted from your hands onto the baseball can fade the autograph.

, Not only will this prevent you and others from handling the ball too much, it will protect the autograph from ultraviolet rays that can damage both your baseball and it's autograph through over extended exposure.

,


Display or store your baseballs in a room around 75 degrees F (23.89 C) with about 50% humidity. Any room hotter (like an attic) or with more humidity (like a basement) could affect the signature, making it fade or run. A hot or humid environment also could damage the baseball itself over an extended period of time.
Place your baseballs on display away from as much light as possible. Natural light can fade a signature on a baseball quickly. Also, do not shine a light directly on a baseball as this, too, can fade a signature. Any lights in the room should be indirect, and not shine directly on the baseball.

, A length of river edge that is sandy/rocky has high potential, as the same geological processes that created that kind of river edge also tend toward depositing such things as bottles. For time's sake, you should consider how far you should go before turning back and stick to that plan. On the way back you can concentrate your search closer or further from the water. Give yourself plenty of daylight time and try not to get caught out at dusk. River edges can be dangerous places in the dark.

, Bottle glass tends to stand out when you come across it, especially the valued bright colour ones.

, Try not to pull too hard, as it may be fragile or broken. If necessary, gently dig around the bottle with your fingers or a stick.

, Wash the dirty bottle in the river and put it in a soft bag, a big pocket or what-have-you. When you get home you can clean the bottle better with a mild detergent (like dish soap). Avoid harsh cleaners, and never put them in a dishwasher if you want to retain their collectible value.

Be patient.",How to Find Shark Teeth," Sharks migrate to and from different areas depending on the time of year. Some areas have lots of shark teeth because large numbers of sharks travel around the shores often. For example, sandbar sharks are found in large numbers off the east coast of Florida in spring when they mate. They move north at the end of summer and have their pups, so areas like Delaware Bay have a large population towards the early fall., Look up shark populated areas and select a beach to search for teeth. Sharks live in salt water only (except bull sharks who swim up into freshwater rivers that connect to the ocean). So don't go looking in your local pond. Sharks are more common in hot, humid places such as Hawaii and Florida. Although they can also be found at the poles.


Many coastal regions of states near the ocean like California, Florida, Hawaii, Virginia, Carolina and Alabama were once underwater. You can sometimes even find shark teeth fossils in these areas on dry land or in river beds since large portions of the state were submerged. Sharks were often drawn to these shallow waters to seek food., Big storms can bring in all sorts of debris from the ocean, including shark teeth.There will also be fewer visitors on the beach on days when the weather is less than ideal.

, Go in the morning when there are fewer people in the water. The calmer waters will make it easier to see any shark teeth.


Weekdays are usually a less popular beach time, so go then if possible to avoid the crowds.

, You won't find a shark tooth in five minutes. Be prepared to stay at the beach for a couple hours. Bring sunscreen and some water to stay there properly without harm. You may also want to pack a picnic lunch.

, People may be able to tell you about shark tooth hot-spots or places where they commonly found teeth. If you aren't from the area, a local may be able to tell you which beaches draw crowds and when, and which ones have a lot of teeth. You can improve your chances of finding teeth right away if you find someone that can point you in the right direction.

, Depending on what state or country you are looking for shark teeth in, you may need to get a permit before searching for fossils. In some areas, permits aren't necessary for shark teeth, but you never know what else you might find.

, Shark teeth have a pointy top and a thin body. Most teeth along the beach or shoreline are 1/8"" to 3/4"" but you can often locate larger teeth further out in the ocean. Some teeth look like a triangle without a top, some are more Y-shaped. Identification can sometimes be difficult because the tooth characteristics can change depending on the location of the tooth in the jaw, and the age or sex of the shark., Many fossilized shark teeth are black.These are what you are most likely to find along the beach. Other less common colors of shark teeth are gray or brown. Modern shark teeth are usually white in color on the tooth and the root, they are seldom found along the shoreline.Remember everything you find that is triangular isn't a shark tooth, they could be rocks or stones so be sure that you know the looks of a tooth.
Look for any souvenir shops near the beach. They may have some shark teeth for sale so you can see an example of what you are searching for.

, Shark teeth can often be found in easily on top of the loose sediment. It might be hard to spot among the shells and pebbles. If you just look on top of the sand you might not have a lot of luck.

, If you do not spot any teeth on the surface, you will need to start digging. Bring some tools. You might want a shovel, trowel, or bucket. You will probably want something to sift sand with, like a colander or strainer.Dig in a place where sand is unusually elevated. Teeth won't always be on the surface. Sand constantly covers up old sand with new sand. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.

, If you aren't having much luck on the beach, try moving out into the shallows. Bring your strainer and reach down below the surface and scoop up some sediment. Sift through the sediment to see what you find.


While shark teeth are the big catch, keep an eye out for other cool items like stingray, porpoise, or crocodile teeth. You might find some cool shells, too.

, You can search more terrain off the shoreline when you go diving and you might find some larger, older shark teeth by searching a little further from the beach.

, Don't just glance at an area of sand and move on. Finding sharks teeth usually takes a bit of time and persistence. Waves may bring in new teeth, so it is a good idea to check areas multiple times. A single shark can produce up to 25,000 teeth over a lifetime, so there are plenty of them out there to be found."

Consider the possible pitfalls of displaying teapots in your home.,
Consider the space that you have available.,
Ask others in the house how they feel about your teapot display.",How to Display a Teapot Collection," Home display is not the same as museum display; usually it is not possible to rope off a room and say ""don't touch""! When planning for your display, it is important to think about the possible challenges your teapot collection might face.


You won't want your collection getting in the way of other activities and if you have concerns about the teapots being broken by children, pets, or general activities and traffic in the home, this will also need to be taken into account when planning.
If you live somewhere that is also disturbed by earthquakes, you will need to take this into account when planning their display, in order to minimise possible damage. Also, if you have concerns about theft, you will need to take this into account when displaying and insuring high value items.;
, After realising where it is not ideal to place your teapots, it is time to consider where your teapots might fit best. Placing them high or away from general traffic makes good sense but it is dependent on the furniture and space in your home. Some suggestions that might work for your home display include:


Place the teapots on the top of kitchen cupboards. Where kitchen cupboards do not reach to the ceiling, this unused space can be a valuable display area that is visually interesting. The one drawback of this is that you will need to climb a ladder for cleaning and dusting on a regular basis, unless you don't mind the dust bunny build-up.
Use a cabinet with glass doors. Glass cabinets can be standalone or mounted on a wall like a shelf. These make excellent display units because the glass wards off the dust, and the entire cabinet acts as a barrier to ward off touching and interfering with the collection. This can be an expensive option, especially if you don't already own such a cabinet but it is worthwhile doing and the cost can be reduced by looking for used furniture online or buying through an inexpensive furniture supplier such as IKEA.

Shelves. Have special shelves put up just for the teapots. These can be placed in a single area of the home, or arranged wherever there is suitable space.
Consider shadow boxes. Shadow boxes are another type of shelving that provide depth and a ""boxing"" frame for the object placed inside of them. If you can get shadow boxes that are tailored to fit the size of your teapots, this could be an excellent display method. If you, or someone in the family, are handy with woodworking skills, shadow boxes can be made very easily and the measurements can be adjusted to suit each individual teapot. Arrange them on the wall or in different parts of the house to fit in with the décor.
Arrange across a mantle over a fireplace. Teapots along a mantle can look very interesting and can serve as a conversation piece.

, You might get some constructive feedback on locating it where it doesn't cause problems for other household activities. You might even inspire someone to build you a nice display cabinet!

Obtain or build a lighted curio cabinet.,
Build shelving to fit a window opening.,
Use a baker's rack or plant stand.,

Mount multiple smaller shelves on a wall to display smaller groups of glassware.,
Alternatively, you could simply utilize areas in your home.",How to Display a Glass Collection," Look for one with shelves spaced for the height of your items. Shell collectors and insect collectors actually have special boxes with glass lids made that can slide out of their cabinets like drawers.
, A set of glass shelves attached to a window frame would bring the natural light through your glass collection and could be admired from both inside and outside your home., These are generally made of widely spaced wire mesh or rods, so you would need to place a shelf (preferably clear glass) over the wires to allow the items to sit level while still allowing maximum light through., This is not recommended for heavier pieces, however, as they require more solid support and nobody wants large glass vases and figurines suddenly cracking through their shelves and shattering on the floor., For instance, windowsills are excellent for smaller items and other horizontal areas (book shelves, top of the piano, coffee tables, end tables) work for the remaining larger items."

Know about games.,
Start off small.,
Expand to more than just games.,
Don't be afraid to try new things.",How to Collect Video Games," This doesn't mean you should memorize every console for each game generation, but you should still have a feel for which consoles were the front-runners. Don't waste time learning about the Amiga CD32 if you could be spending that time learning more about the Nintendo 64. Once you have a basic knowledge of the blockbuster consoles and their games you can learn more about the more obscure systems and titles.;
, Buy a lot on eBay with a console, controllers and some games. This is the cheapest way to start a collection. When you have the big titles everyone knows about, start to buy more obscure games. Don't be afraid to get doubles or triples, game collecting is about playing games as well as storing them in a safe place for the future. If a game breaks, a double is a perfect identical replacement.

, Books and action figures make great collectibles. Books can expand a library as well as a game collection, and action figures give a nice touch to everything they are near. Strategy guides are also useful, and very collectible.

, Maybe the Playstation 2 was the best console of the sixth generation, but that doesn't mean there wasn't a large amount of good games on the Gamecube. Having medium amounts of games on each console can add some variety to an otherwise dull collection.

Get inspiration.,
Decide on how you will collect teapots.,
Consider affordability and availability.,
Learn as much as you can about marks and designs so that you can avoid buying fakes.,
Avoid buying teapots in poor condition unless you have a really good reason for doing so.,
Broaden your collection.",How to Collect Teapots," Before you start collecting, it is important to know what you like about teapots. Check out collections and styles of teapots held or owned by other people that you know and try to see some exhibitions if possible. Here are some good resources to get your research started:


Museums - especially museums concerned with design, with household items, with the way people used to live. Look out for teapot exhibitions, which are held regularly in different parts of the world. Even if you can't make one in another country, you might be able to browse some of the collection online through the museum or exhibitor's site.
Books and magazines - look in antique and collectibles resources in the library, ditto for magazines.
Antique and collectibles stores - browse around; you will be amazed at what you will find; and don't forget opportunity shops (charity stores) either - they will often have teapots.
Friends and family - look at the items kept by people you know. Ask them questions about where they bought the teapot, why they bought it, how they feel about it, etc. It all goes towards informing you about how you will approach collecting teapots.;
, There are many different ways to collect, based on interest, budget, availability, etc. You will need to consider how to define and limit your collection so that it is doable, affordable and fits in with your lifestyle (space!). Here are some considerations to take into account:


Historical teapots - Do you like teapots belong to a particular era in history? Do you only like modern teapots? Or old teapots? There are many, many possibilities here. For example, you might be fond of Victorian era silver teapots or Art Deco ceramic teapots. This will be something that your prior research will help you to decide.
Style - Do you prefer a particular style of teapot? Are you looking for teapots that will match existing decor or themes in your home?
Make - Do you prefer a particular brand or make of teapot?
Material - Perhaps you are keen to a certain material only; for example, you can collect silver, terracotta, ceramic, glass, bone china, cast iron, etc., teapots.
Country of origin - Do you only want to collect Japanese or Chinese teapots? Or Early Colonial teapots from the southern hemisphere?
Design - Perhaps you only want teapots with animal motifs, or spots, or stripes? This type of collecting is known as ""novelty"" teapot collecting. Collecting in this manner can narrow down the options but it can be a huge source of fun and enjoyment at the same time!
Tea company designs - Sometimes tea companies sell their own brand teapots and this can be a collectible theme of its very own.
Eclectic - There is nothing preventing you from collecting teapots in an ""anything goes"" fashion either; collect it just because you like it! This is probably the easiest and most budget-adjustable approach to collecting teapots because you can be very flexible in your additions. An eclectic collection can be just as valuable and interesting as a themed one, provided that you take good care of the teapots and choose quality to begin with (see below about spotting problems).

, These are two key elements of a successful collection. If it will be difficult to source a teapot, or expensive, you might want to consider alternative ways of branching out in your teapot collection. It might be a case of having one expensive centrepiece and a cheaper supporting cast of pretty but budget-conscious teapots.

, When you get really serious about collecting, it's likely that you'll start looking for more expensive and rarer items to add to your collection and that you will focus on particular makes, such as Meissen.


A good way of doing this is to attend local auctions or to search online auctions for sales. However, it is important that you are familiar with the marks and signs of the manufacturer so that you avoid making costly mistakes and bringing home a fake. Take the time to borrow books on the topic and learn the marks and design signatures that confirm the authenticity of your teapots.

, It is important to add only quality to your collection, or it won't carry value (beyond sentimental) into the future. Things to be extra careful of when examining teapots include:


Cracks, including fine hairline cracks that are difficult to see, and glued-back sections. Look closely at the lid and spout for the most likely break lines.
Chips
Missing parts (such as the lid, a handle, etc.).

, If you have the space and the interest, you might consider teacups, tea trays, tea kettles, sugar bowls, milk jugs, tea towels featuring teapots, fabric with teapot prints, etc., as part of an overall collection. While this will increase the cost and the usage of space, it can be a very rewarding dimension to your collecting hobby that can also be put to good use during tea parties.

Know what to look for.,
Decide on what you want to collect.,
Visit a museum to see what telephone collections it has.,
Learn the prices for collectible phones.,
Join an organization, club, or group that shares your passion for collecting phones.,
Display your phone collection.",How to Collect Telephones," When collecting telephones, the things to bear in mind when selecting collectible phones include:


Quality of the equipment
Originality
Rarity
Appearance
Working order or not (and whether or not that matters).;
, As mentioned in the introduction, you can collect according to era, style, type of phone, etc. The reason for your collection is always up to you but bear in mind affordability, rarity, interest to other collectors, ease of collecting, and ways of displaying your collection. In the case of phones, you'll also need to consider whether you'd like the phones to be in working or not, so that you can continue to use them, or simply display them. Some ideas for how to collect include:


Collecting all the phones belonging to one make, brand, or company. If that company is still going strong today, you might even include phones from modern times, such as cell phones and portable phones.
Collecting phones from a certain era, such as 1900s to 1920s, wartime phones, 1960s phones, etc.
Collecting phones made from Bakelite only.
Collecting phones of a certain color or style.
Collecting phones made for a special reason, such as the Princess set phones, or phones made for such companies as Disney, like Mickey Mouse shaped phones.
Collecting phones owned by famous people.
Collecting phones that were unique and one-offs, that maybe didn't even work that well but were prototypes and ahead of their time.

, It will usually be part of a communications or telecommunications display in a museum that is known for keeping such artifacts.

, You can learn this by looking through the collectible sections of online auctions sites such as eBay. Another way is to check antique collectibles books in the library, bookstore, or your own copies. Doing this will give you a good idea of what price ranges to expect for the types of phones you're keen to collect. Some of the prices are determined by age, some by rarity, and some by popularity. Here are some indicators of the values of some phones:


The oldest telephones were wall mounted and often mounted on wood. The very early wooden wall phones and candlestick phone models were handcrafted, making them very rare and worthwhile collectibles. They can sell for $200 plus.
Art deco phones tend to fetch a lot in terms of collector's items. These were made during the 1930s and 1950s. They can start at $50 and go for more than $200.
Bakelite phones are a popular collectible phone.
Phones produced in large quantities won't be worth as much as the older, more interesting original phones. Such phones include the Western Electric 202 (1928 to 1940s), Western Electric 302 (1937 to early 1950s), the Western Electric 500 sets (early 1950s to 1970s) and the Western Electric AE40 were all made in large quantities and while these can be viewed as vintage to old, they're not worth a lot because of the quantities in which they were produced.
Some phones are special because they were made to specific needs, such as phones for children or for certain events or people. For example, the Western Electric Princess set was made for children and has a range of colors. The colors affect the price, with pink and aqua fetching up to $100, beige and white up to $40. Look for promotional and advertising special phones that were one-offs if you'd like to find unique phones for your collection.

, That way you can meet other people and share information and advice, as well as trading phones and finding leads for phones you'd like to collect where possible. If you can go to collector's conventions, this will be another way to meet people with a similar interest and to find out more about the value of your collection.

, It's important that you have the chance to show others your collection as that's a large part of the fun. Phones can easily take up a lot of space, but you can certainly hang wall phones on a wall, and arrange table phones in a glass fronted cabinet. Working phones can be put to good use in the house but be aware that technologically inclined people can get really irritable with old phones, especially if they want to pay bills or use numbered keypads, so always have at least one modern phone that works and is plugged in!

Who produces first day covers?,
What cover producer to choose?,
What covers to collect?,
Limited Editions.,
Cover addresses.,
Looking after your covers: Purchase an album with leaves to hold your covers.",How to Collect First Day Covers," All Great British stamps come from Royal Mail. But not all covers come from them. Royal Mail does produce its own covers but several private producers do too. These are the ones to choose if you want to collect covers that could be worth something in the future. Royal Mail covers are fun but will never be worth much more than what you paid for them because they are mass produced and have your name and address printed on.;
, There are several main private producers; Buckingham Covers, Benham, Westminster and Adrian Bradbury. Buckingham Covers and Adrian Bradbury are the first for quality. Buckingham Covers are seen as the best investments, because the company actively buys back their own covers, often at higher prices than they sold them. Benham were traditionally UK’s leading cover producer, but in recent years they seem to have lost their way.

, Some people like to have everything and collect lots of covers every year. This may not be for you and my advice is to buy what you like. Quality counts, so buy the best you can afford and covers carrying genuine signatures add to their value.

, How many of one cover should be produced? Future value does not depend on the number produced, it depends on the number of new collectors and a large appeal. So don’t fall into the “only 50 produced, they will be worth a fortune trap”. Very small numbers make the people who have them happy and just annoy the ones who haven't. At the other end the cover may be a limited edition of 1000, which is fine if they are selling out but not if they still have 600 in stock. Why not give the producer a call and ask them how many they still have available. But which ever way you decide to go buy the cover you like first.

, All newly produced covers should have no address on them and if you are interested in older covers, try to purchase ones with pencil, printed labels or typed addresses.

, This will keep them safe and protect them. Keeping your covers in good condition helps them hold their value. If you want to show of your covers, why not frame them for the wall? Be sure to use acid-free mounts and boards and do not hang in direct sunlight.

Look for first appearances of seminal characters.,
Consider the age of the comic book.,
Consider the historical context of the comic book when it was published.,
Look for older comics in good condition.",How to Collect Comics for Profit1," The most valuable comic books historically have been those that featured the first appearance of characters that have had a major impact on the genre. A partial list of such comics is given below:


Action Comics #1 (June 1938): The first appearance of Superman.
Detective Comics #27 (May 1939): The first appearance of Batman.
Superman #1 (June 1939): The first comic devoted to the Man of Steel, and the first comic book named for a superhero character.
Marvel Comics #1 (October 1939): The first appearances of the original Human Torch (Jim Hammond) and the Sub-Mariner. (First title published by Timely Comics, which would eventually become Marvel Comics.)
Flash Comics #1 (January 1940): First appearance of the original Flash (Jay Garrick) and the original Hawkman.
More Fun Comics #52 (February 1940): First appearance of the Spectre, the first ghost superhero
Batman #1 (Spring 1940): Besides being the first comic devoted solely to the Caped Crusader, it also introduced Robin, the Boy Wonder, and arch-foe the Joker.
All-American Comics #16 (July 1940): The first appearance of the original Green Lantern (Alan Scott).
Fantastic Four #1 (November 1961): First appearance of the team of that name, composed of Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Girl, the Human Torch (Johnny Storm), and the Thing. (This was the first title published by Marvel Comics under that company name.)
Amazing Fantasy #15 (August 1962): First appearance of Spider-Man.
Other first appearance issues include All-Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940/41), the first appearance of the Justice Society of America (the first superhero team); All-Star Comics #8 (December 1941), the first appearance of Wonder Woman; Whiz Comics #2 (February 1940), the first appearance of the original Captain Marvel; Captain America #1 (March 1941), the first appearance of and Police Comics #1 (August 1941), the first appearance of Plastic Man.;
, Older comic books are more valuable than newer comics because of both their age and their relative rarity compared to newer comics. Comics published during the Platinum and Golden Ages are particularly valuable, while comics less than 20 years old have more intrinsic than monetary value to collectors. Comic book ages are described below, with the beginning and ending years:


The Platinum Age (1897 to 1933): These comics predate the superhero era, featuring characters such as the Yellow Kid, the Katzenjammer Kids, Buster Brown, and characters featured initially in comic strips and reprinted in comic book format. Only a select group of dealers deal in comics this old.
The Golden Age (1933 to 1955): While some consider the Golden Age of comics to have begun with the premiere of Superman in Action Comics #1, others begin the Golden Age sooner to include predecessors to the Man of Steel created for comic books, such as Doctor Occult, premiering October 1935 in New Fun #6. These comics are typically 4-color comics 64 pages in length, declining to 48 pages by the end of the era.
The Silver Age (1956 to 1969): Many consider the Silver Age to have begun with the premiere of the second Flash (Barry Allen) in Showcase #4 (October 1956), while others consider the premiere of the Martian Manhunter in Detective Comics #225 (November 1955) to be the starting point. Older Silver Age comics are 48-page 4-color comics, with later titles declining to 32 pages.
The Bronze Age (1970 to 1985): Comics became more mature during this period, with heroes such as Green Lantern and Green Arrow confronting social issues along with super villains and Iron Man confronting his alcoholism instead of his heart condition.
The Iron Age or Modern Age (1986 to present): Comics became still more mature, and story continuity became more important. Comics companies increasingly turned to sweeping story arcs that crossed through their entire line of comics, such as DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths and Zero Hour and Marvel's Secret Wars and World War Hulk. Story arcs that encompassed only a single character or team were and are frequently collected and reprinted as graphic novels. Many comics of this era are printed on slicker, higher-quality paper than comics of the previous eras. (Some comic book historians use the term ""Modern Age"" to encompass both the Bronze and Iron Ages of comics.)

, An understanding of the time period in which a comic book was published can help you understand which comic books are more valuable than others. Captain America was predated by several patriotic-themed heroes, including Mr. America and the Shield. Because his premiere showed him punching Hitler's jaw, he became more famous than his competitors and so became the more enduring character. Likewise, Wonder Woman's premiere near the start of America's entry into World War II, coupled with her powers, patriotic costume, and self-reliant attitude made her the foremost super heroine in comics, even though several super heroines predated her.

, The better the condition the comic book is in, the more it can earn when sold to another collector. Comic book condition is affected by how often the comic has been read and the way it has been stored. Condition is rated 2 ways, with a set of verbal grades and with a numeric scale.


The term ""Mint"" refers to comics which show the least wear and tear, and progresses downward through ""Very Fine,"" ""Fine,"" ""Very Good,"" ""Good,"" and ""Fair."" The worst comics are graded ""Poor""; these comics are missing their covers and some of the pages. You'll find these terms in comics guides such as the Overstreet Price Guide.
Numeric grades run as high as 10.0 to as low as 0.5. These grades are used by comics grading services such as the Comic Guaranty Company (CGC) and Professional Grading Experts (PGX). These grades are more precise than the verbal grades and have accordingly caused the verbal scale to be modified with sub-grades to better correspond to the numeric scale.

Look for complete or partially complete Buffy collections on eBay or Craigslist.",How to Collect Buffy Comics," Most cities and even smaller towns have a comic book store. These stores carry comics of varying condition but also allow the ability to back order old and new comics through trusted sellers.;
, In the world of comics, trade volumes are an entire season of comics bound into 1 soft cover book. They tend to cost around the price of a novel, but they are not seen as collectible comics.


If your desire is to read the Buffy comics from the beginning, and not collect, then you should choose trade volumes. Your local comic book store may be able to order you the whole set of trade volumes from the first season to the last.
If you do not want to read every comic in a season, but you would like to read the best comics, you can choose to invest in the Buffy Omnibus'. These Omnibus trade paperback editions include selected comics from that series. The story is not continuous so they can be confusing for the occasional Buffy reader.

, Although you may only be collecting for personal enjoyment, you will want to buy enough cardboard backing and plastic coverings for each of your individual comics. You may want to buy scotch tape to tape back the flap of the plastic protector.


Use a hard, protective crate in which to place your collectible Buffy comics. You may also want to create cardboard dividers between seasons. This is only necessary if you intend to collect individual comics and you want to ensure they will survive storage conditions.

, These series are entitled Tales of the Slayers and Tales of the Vampires. Although they are part of the ""Buffyverse,"" they were created after the series began, and they take place between the ancient times and 1995 in a number of different countries.

, Many Buffy comics were created with 2 types of covers. One cover features a more realistic drawing of Buffy as played by Sarah Michelle Gellar and the other cover is a more traditional comic rendition of Buffy and the other characters.

, This season will be seen as more costly to an individual comic collector. Choose wisely based on the condition and price of each comic.


Season 1 takes place in and around Los Angeles between the summers of 1996 and 1997. There are 4 graphic novels attributed to this time.
Season 2 takes place between fall 1997 and the summer of 1998. Buffy moves to Sunnydale, where the majority of the comics and television shows are set. Approximately 6 graphic novels were published, although they were not all canonical.
Season 3 takes place mostly in 1998. Approximately 12 books were published, although not all were canonical.
Season 4 takes place in 1999 and 2000. It is also the first year that the Angel spin-off comic was published. The 2 series take place in the same time period after Angel's departure from the Buffy television show. There are approximately 6 novels.
Season 5 takes place in Sunnydale in 2000 and 2001. It is also the year of the Angel Series Season 2. There are approximately 7 books.
Season 6 takes place in Sunnydale in 2001 and 2002. It is also the year of Angel's Series Season 3. There are approximately 6 books, including a prequel.
Season 7 was a shorter series of prequel books that coincided with Angel's Series Season 4. These were Tales of the Vampires.
Season 8 takes place in 2004 to 2005 and directly follows the aftermath of the end of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer's TV series. There are approximately 9 books that follow similar story paths.
Season 9 deputed in the fall of 2010, continuing the plot as started in Season 8.

, You can download free applications on tablets or phones. Then you can choose to buy the comics for approximately the same price as you would from a newsstand.

Avoid special reprint comics.,
Avoid gimmicks.",How to Collect Comics for Profit2," Although helpful for those collectors who collect comic books for the stories or the artwork, reprint comics such as ""Famous First Editions"" have nowhere near the monetary value of the original issues they are reprints of.


The only reprint exception is Superman #1, which reprinted the Superman story in Action Comics #1. It was the first comic named for a superhero character, however, and subsequent issues featured original stories of the Man of Tomorrow.

, As comic book companies became aware of the collector market, they began pandering to it with various gimmicks designed to boost sales. Although these gimmicks made money for the comics companies, these comics were produced in large enough quantities that they provide little value for collectors who collect for profit. Such gimmicks include:


Shipping new comics pre-bagged. Although collectors bag their comics to preserve their value, buying a comic already bagged forces the buyer to choose whether to keep the comic in its bag to preserve its value or open the bag to read it and reduce its value. The hope was that buyers would buy 2 copies, 1 to read and 1 to keep.
Variant covers. Some comics were released with 2, 3, or even over 50 different covers, each representing a different scene in the story inside. While some of these are incredibly valuable, without knowing what you are looking for, you could spend money on books with virtually no value. Since the mid-2000s, most variants are either released tied to an event (comic-con, or store release), or limited based on the number of copies of a comic that a store orders (1 variant per 100 copies of the normal cover that the store purchases). Knowing how rare a book is an how many were printed makes all of the difference in the value potential.
Gimmick covers. In addition to variant covers, other cover gimmicks used include holograms, foil stamping, or glow-in-the-dark covers. Some gimmicks may have been tied to milestone issues, such as the silver foil cover for Issue 25 of Valiant's ""Magnus, Robot Fighter,"" but in most cases, the stories were not notably better than those in issues without the gimmicks.

Visit your local comic book shop.,
Deal with an auction house.,
Advertise in newspapers and trade publications.,
Check out second-hand markets.,
Go to comic book shows and conventions.,
Go online.",How to Collect Comics for Profit3," In addition to their racks of current titles, many comic shops also feature boxes of older comics as well as bagged rarer issues. Buying from a comics shop may cost you more than from other sources, though, because you're also paying for the dealer's overhead.

, Some estate sales may include a collection of older comics, and auction houses also provide a way to advertise a collection you're trying to sell. However, these promotional services come with a price, which usually includes an auctioneer's fee; many auction houses therefore prefer to deal with older, rarer comics.

, General-circulation newspapers and specialty trade publications are both places to advertise that you're looking for certain comics issues to add to your collection or that you have issues to sell.

, A number of second-hand bookstores and flea markets sell comic books as part of their inventory; many of them also buy comics to resell to others. You can also buy comics at yard sales.

, Conventions dedicated to comic books began in the late 1960s, providing comics fans the opportunity to buy and sell comics, as well as to meet their favorite writers and artists and the actors who have portrayed their favorite characters. Smaller shows run a half-day or full day, while larger conventions run 3 to 5 days.


The largest comic convention is Comic-Con, held in San Diego in July. Other major comic conventions are held in New York and Chicago.
If you can't make a comic book convention, many science fiction conventions feature a comics programming track and include one or more comic book dealers among the vendors in their dealers' rooms.

, There are several ways you can buy or sell comics online.


Many comic book dealers have online storefronts. As with brick-and-mortar comics shops, however, you may be paying for dealer overhead as well as the comic book itself.
You can buy or sell comic books through online marketplaces such as Craigslist or Amazon.com or auction sites such as eBay. In addition, there are specialized comic book auction sites as comiclink.com and comicconnect.com.
You can network with other comic book fans through online communities and forums devoted to comic books. These forums will provide you with the chance to learn more about the comic medium and get advice on where and how to buy and sell comics.

Bag your comics.,
Use backing boards.,
Tape the bags shut.,
Box up your bagged comics.,
Store the comics in a safe place.,
Inspect your comics periodically.",How to Collect Comics for Profit4," Using a protective plastic bag will keep your comics from being exposed to atmospheric pollutants such as dust and harmful gases. Bags are available for most comic book sizes and in materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or Mylar. Polyethylene and polypropylene bags are designed to last for 3 to 5 years, after which time they should be replaced, while Mylar bags are designed to last for longer periods. Whichever type of plastic bag you use, be sure to buy bags that are acid-free to prevent damage to the comic inside.

, Backing boards help keep your comics flat in the bag. As with bags, choose boards that are acid-free and insert them in the bag with the comic slowly, with the shiny side facing the comic book. Backing boards should be replaced every 3 to 5 years to remove any contaminants that may have gathered while the comics were in storage.

, You can use either a regular tape or double-sided tape, provided it is acid-free.

, After bagging your comics, place them upright in a protective box. The best boxes to use are acid-free cardboard boxes made for the purpose.

, A ""safe place"" means not just safe from prying eyes, but also somewhere safe from environmental damage. Store your comics somewhere cool, dry, and dark, away from both sunlight and fluorescent light. A closet on the main level is best, with a dry basement a good second, but an attic subject to temperature and humidity fluctuations throughout the year is the worst storage location.


Keep the storage box at least 5 to 10 inches (12.5 to 25 cm) off the floor, with space around it to allow air to circulate and prevent the growth of molds and fungi.

, Even with the best storage, it's still possible for comics to get damaged. The surest way to prevent lasting damage is by checking your comics over every so often.


When handling comics, use cotton gloves if possible as if you were handling historic documents in an archive, as in a sense, you are.

Buy your yarn and look at the label. Find the image with the crochet hook on it and look for a letter or number. This tells you the crochet hook size you need for that yarn.
, This will make things more consistent and help give your border something to attach to. When you reach the corners, put 4 stitches into 1 stitch; this creates the bend and prevents it from curling. When you reach the sides, take into account your stitches. You want the same amount of stitches on all four sides.If your piece is made up of double-crochets, you may need to put 2 stitches each stitch on the sides.

Check the record for any surface scratches or marks.,
Avoid very dusty records unless you have a reliable way to clean them.,
Feel the thickness of the record, looking directly from the sides to see any warping.,
Pay attention to a record's grade, avoiding anything lower than VG when purchasing.,
Always try to listen to expensive records before you buy them.",How to Buy Used LP Records1," Almost all records will have some light scratching and marks on them. These are usually small, whitish scratches just on the surface of the vinyl, and you can tell they don't gouge into the grooves. However, some records will have cuts: deeper areas where you can see the grooves of the vinyl are chipped or scratched. While one or two small cuts may not render a record unplayable, it significantly lowers the price.


Deep scratches can often be felt with your fingernail, whereas smaller ones will be tough to feel.
If a record has a scratch in it but you still really want it, try to sample it first.
If you're only buying the records for decoration, you still shouldn't ignore the record's quality. Finding scratches or defects can help you drive the price down.;
, Records play music physically -- the needle lays on the grooves and translates them into sound. So anything on the record, such as dust or lint, will cause the needle to move when it hits it, ""creating"" noise. This is where the static and popping noises come from on an old record. While light dust can be removed with a brush, any record that is visibly covered in dust is hard to make playable without a special vinyl vacuum cleaner.


For light dust, purchase a record brush and a little vial of distilled water to clean them quickly., Thinner records are cheaper and degrade in quality much faster than thicker records. They also warp, or permanently bend, much faster. To notice the difference in thickness, pick up an old record in the discount section and a new, nice record. The former will be flimsy and easily bent, but high-quality records are solid, slightly heavy objects. If a record has warped it may still be playable, but it will sound slightly off and may skip.


New records are often printed on ""180g"" vinyl, which is a great, high-quality weight that will last for some time.
Be especially wary of records that were stacked on top of each other, not side by side, as this is the major cause of warping., The condition of a record and its sleeve will be frequently graded by the seller, and should always be provided when buying online. While this grading process is subjective and varies between sellers, it provides you with valuable information in terms of the record's condition and its appropriate price. A minor change in grade can mean a huge change in price for an extremely rare record.



Mint (M) or Near Mint (NM or M-): These records are near perfect, having been played no more than one or two times (records graded ""Mint"" have never been played at all). Rare, expensive, and high-quality, with the jacket perfect as well.

Very Good Plus (VG+): Will play perfectly. Other than a few cosmetic defects, such as sticker peeling, light discoloration, and even light warping, a VG+ could be an NM. Occasionally you will see E, NM-, or VG++ to denote the record is slightly better than VG+, but not quite mint condition.

Very Good (VG): Light scratching, some noise when played. The jacket and labels will be generally worn or slightly damaged. However, VG records usually don't have all of these problems at once -- just one or two.

Good (G) or Good Plus (G+): Should still play through without skipping, though were will be noise in the background. The cover won't be in great shape. Still, any record graded G or G+ should still play without major issues.

Poor (P) or Fair (F): These records are cracked, warped, or deeply scratched. Unless it is a very, very rare record, these shouldn't sell for more than $0.50, Even if you can't listen to the whole thing, you want to check out any problem areas you've found and get an idea for the overall noise level of the record. All record stores should have 2-3 sample turntables with headphones attached that allow you to test a record out, and if not you can usually ask the clerk to put it on.


When listening, pay attention to the quiet moments, like the fade in and out. While a little static and some pops are normal, it should be subtle and never overpower the music.
If you see any scratches, test them out by putting the needle just before the scratch and listening to how it handles the noise when it gets there.

Know that the price of a record depends, mostly, on how much you're willing to pay for it.,
Search for the record's code online to get a good idea of the price.,
Know that still and currently popular bands will be much more expensive.,
Pay attention to the record jacket, looking for splitting or cracks.,
Determine what you are prepared to spend and be ready to bargain.",How to Buy Used LP Records2," Records are not a regulated market, and other than a few well-known and high-value records, most of the prices are subjective. While there are guides out there to price 1,000s of records, they depend on the quality of the cover, vinyl, and the scarcity of the record in the store. This means two things -- you can often find incredible deals, especially at thrift stores and garage sales, and that you should be ready to bargain to your desired price.


Even record store clerks are ready, and used to, bargaining for records. If you feel like something is overpriced, be sure to make an offer.

, On the spine of the jacket and the record's ring is a combination of letters and numbers, such as CBS 88478 (London Calling, The Clash), that tells you a bit of the pressing and history. It is also a simple way to look up the value of the record, simply using your smartphone to check the code on a site like Discogs. You can see what other people are selling the disc for, as well as other ways to identify record's price.


If the record is worth some money, be sure to keep reading. For example, many early Beatles pressings have the same code for many pressings.

, This isn't some scientific formula, as the popularity of a record is almost entirely determined by how well known the band is. Thus the Rolling Stones, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, and other still-popular bands tend to be worth much more money, as collectors across the world are still searching for these major bands.


On the inverse, if you've seen lots and lots of the same record you can be sure that it is relatively cheap, like Fleetwood Mac's popular but incredibly common ""Rumors."", The record jacket is, in many ways, just as important as the actual vinyl. If the jacket comes with extra stuff, like the poster of Prince in original Purple Rain copies, the whole record will likely be more expensive. While most people listening to records simply want an album that sounds good, collectors know that the jacket is a major indicator of a record's worth. Issues that will lower the price of the record include:


Writing on the record, such as the old owner signing their name.
Splitting seems, cracking, or ripping.
Missing or ripped lyric sheets and sleeves
Torn/bent corner, hole punched (indicates it was a discount buy when originally released)., Records vary wildly in price. Most record stores have ""budget"" bins of records selling very cheaply, while incredibly rare records can fetch large amounts in online auctions. If you want to build a large collection cheaply, you can easily do so by picking up records in thrift stores or in the budget section of record stores. Either way, remember that the record market is a bargaining system, and you can always ask for a deal or discount to save money. The more you know about the record, the better price you can often get:


Note any defects or issues to the seller that may get them to lower their price.
Try making a deal on a stack of records, not each individual one. Many sellers are willing to get rid of a lot of inventory quickly for a discount.
Look up the pressing and average online price -- as this is a good base point to negotiate from.

"
"
Check out local record stores for the best quality, but highest prices.,
Dig through the massive collections at thrift or antique stores for hidden gems.,
Bargain for records at vinyl fairs and flea markets.,
Aim for garage and estate sales to see large collections for low prices.,
Search online for tough-to-find records, but be wary of conditions.",How to Buy Used LP Records3," If you're looking for a particular record, hoping for high-quality vinyl, or simply want to browse a well-curated selection, you'll need to go to a record store. However, this is usually not the place to find bargains, as record staff checks and prices each record according to its market value. For the slight added expense, you get more assurance that the records are in good condition, as well as a well-organized, deep collection to browse through instead of random crates.


If you're looking for deals, check the ""recently acquired"" section. These often haven't been priced yet, and you can usually get them for a cheaper price.
Unsure where the stores are near you? Try out the free app Vinyl District which lists all record sellers in your immediate area., Goodwill, Salvation Army, and other thrift stores often take in large quantities of records. The bad news -- most of them are scratched, obscure, and unwanted. The good news -- anything you find is rarely more than $1-3. Digging through thrift stores rarely turns up a ton of new records, but there is always the chance you'll find a rare, hidden gem for almost nothing.


When digging through thrift stores, understand that the majority of the stuff you'll look through is trash, as most places only get a few high-quality records.
Be especially sure to check the quality of the actual vinyl before buying, as these records tend to be mistreated and especially beat up., These events often bring out collectors and crates of vinyl, some of which is organized, some of which isn't. You can run into hard-core collectors at many events who can help find rare pressings and records, but there are just as many people selling large crates of vinyl with no idea how much any of it is worth. Simply start digging through the crates.


When buying records at these places, be sure to bring cash.
Be ready to bargain to score deals, holding firm if you know what a record is really worth. If you do your research ahead of time or check prices on your phone you can almost always get great prices.

, One of the best ways to kick off a record collection is to buy someone else's collection. Garage sales are great places to find records because most people just want things gone. If you've got a little money to spare, you can even offer to buy the entire collection for a steal. Yes, you'll get a lot of junk, but you can often find 5-10 nice pieces for a fraction of the cost, selling off anything else to a local record store to recoup the costs.

, Buying used records online is a great way to round out your collection and dig out hard-to-find pressings, but it comes with its challenges. Namely, you need to be aware of the vinyl rating system, as this is your best indicator of a record's quality online. That said, you should take some extra precautions:


Only buy from recommended or trusted sellers. Check their history on eBay, Discogs, or whatever record pricing platform you use and make sure they give honest, trustworthy ratings (VG+ or higher) for their records.
Always assume that a record is a grade lower than it is advertised, as most sellers will be generous with their rating.
In general, it isn't advised to by any record online not rated VG+ or higher if you plan to play it regularly."

Soak the sand dollars in fresh water.,
Gently brush the shells (optional).,
Soak your shells in bleach.,
Rinse the shells.,
Let your shells dry.,
Prepare your solution.,
Lay your shells on wax paper.,
Paint glue on your sand dollar.,
Make Christmas ornaments.,
Make a glittery sand dollar.,
Make mermaid jewelry.,
Get as creative as you want.",How to Clean and Preserve Sand Dollars," Don't collect living sand dollars. It's considered inhumane and illegal in some places, to kill sand dollars for the express purpose of drying them out and using them as decoration. Always be conscious of the amount of shells you take, and do your part to preserve the sand dollar species by leaving living creatures in the ocean, or tossing them back if they have mistakenly washed up on shore. Sand dollars that have washed up on shore and are whitish or pale in color are most likely dead. These are the ones you want to collect.


Never dig sand dollars from the ocean floor. Sand dollars burrow beneath the sand of the sea floor to protect themselves from predators and debris. If you dig up a sand dollar underwater, there's a good chance that it's alive.
Check them before you take them. Gently turn the sand dollar over and look for tiny, centipede-like feet or hairs on its bottom side. Brush the hairs with your hand. If the hairs move, the sand dollar is alive. Place it gently back into the ocean. If the hairs don't move, feel free to take the sand dollar home.
If a sand dollar is moist or solid in your hand, there's a good chance that it's alive or recently deceased, even if you found it washed up on the beach. Exercise your best judgment, and consider returning a sand dollar to the sea if you aren't sure.;
, These empty shells called ""tests"" may be difficult to find, which makes them even more precious and meaningful.


In many states, it's illegal to collect living sand dollars, and you may face a fine if you're caught in the act.If you're not sure about the law, or if you care about preserving fragile littoral ecosystems, don't take sand dollars directly from the ocean.
Many beaches and coastal authorities restrict the number of sand dollars that you can collect in one day. Research local beach-combing rules and restrictions before you set out for the day.
Before you take a shell from the ocean, make sure no organism is still living inside it. The ocean is a delicate ecosystem and can be dramatically disturbed by over picking, even if you only take ""a few"" shells., Your freshly collected sand dollar shells might have a slight marine odor, which can be caused by small organisms and algae living on the shell. Fill a bucket with clean fresh water and submerge your sand dollar shells inside. Allow them to soak.


The water in the bucket may become discolored or start to smell bad. If this happens, retrieve your shells from the bucket, dump out the water and fill the bucket with clean fresh water. Replace your shells and soak them again.
Continue to soak the shells until they no longer cause the water to discolor.
Soaking your shells in fresh water after collecting them helps to prevent decay.

, During the soaking process, you may see small pieces of debris stuck in the crevices of the shells. In this case, use a soft toothbrush to gently dislodge and debris.


Avoid brushing the shells aggressively. These shells are very delicate and vigorous brushing can cause them to crack.
You can also use a toothpick to gently pick at spots of debris.
Soaking your shell for a longer period will help loosen pieces of debris.

, Once your shells are completely clean, take them out of the fresh water and lay them on a towel to dry while you prepare a solution of half fresh water and half bleach. Soak your sand dollars in the solution. Set a timer and only allow your sand dollars to soak in the bleach for 10 minutes or less. Soaking your shells for longer can cause the shells to disintegrate.


If you're cleaning a number of sand dollars, fill a baking tray with the bleach-and-water solution. This will allow you to spread a number of sand dollars evenly over a broad surface.
Make sure that there's enough solution in the tray to cover the entire sand dollar. You can also use a bowl, a bucket, or a Tupperware container.
If you're only cleaning one sand dollar, find a small bowl, lid, or another container. You won't need much bleach to get the intended effect.

, Remove your shells from your bleach solution using rubber gloves or metal tongs and rinse them under fresh water. Rinse all sides and crevices of the shells completely to wash all of the bleach off.

, Once you have soaked your shells and rinsed them clean of bleach, lay them onto a towel to dry.


For the best results, lay your shells in the sun. This allows them to easily air dry.

, Use equal parts water and equal parts school glue to create a watered down mixture. Line a small bowl with plastic wrap or wax paper to protect the surface of the bowl and mix your solution with a disposable utensil.


Mix as much solution as you think you'll need depending on the size and amount of sand dollar shells you have.

, Like a baking sheet or large plate with wax paper and lay your dry shells on it. Place your shells with the rounded side facing up. Make sure to space your shells an inch or so apart.


Using wax paper allows for an easy clean up.

, Use a soft paintbrush to paint the rounded top side of your shells first. Try to avoid touching the shell with your fingers, this can leave smudges in the glue. Allow the glue to completely dry before flipping the shells over and painting the underside.


Painting your shells with this glue mixture will harden the shells, which will help them last longer.
Maintain a clean work area to ensure dirt and debris don’t get stuck to the sand dollars.
This method will create a dull natural finish for your sand dollars., Use paint, fabric, and cotton balls to turn your sand dollars into fun and creative ornaments. This can be a great craft idea to work on with children. Paint eyes and a nose on a sand dollar and use cotton balls to make a beard. Cut a Santa hat out of red fabric and glue it on top to create a jolly Santa ornament.


Take care when decorating sand dollars with children's. Even though the shells have hardened with the glue finish, they can still be very brittle and delicate.
Use a permanent marker to write the year the ornament was made and the name of the creator for future reference.

, Take some glue, glitter, small rhinestones, and a brush to dazzle up your sand dollar with sparkles. Use a glue dispenser with a nozzle tip to draw creative patterns and cover them with glitter. These can make great gift ideas for parents, relatives, and friends.


Dazzle up a small sand dollar shell and glue it to the edge of a picture frame. Frame a picture of your friends and family together on your beach vacation.

, If you have some sand dollar shells that are relatively small and light, you can string a chain or leather cord through one of the shells natural holes and turn it into a unique pendant necklace.

, There are tons of fun ways to get creative with sand dollar shells. Turn them into beautiful works of art or decorations for your home. Here are some more creative suggestions:


Display your shells with an assortment of your other favorite shells and stones.
Use a brush and watercolor paint to make them pop with color.
Put your favorite seashells in a large glass mason jar and display it in your home.
Loop a strong through the holes in the sand dollars and create a wind chime or tie them into a dream catcher.
Find your own fun ways to decorate and display your precious treasure.

Look at examples of the person’s real signature.,
Compare your autograph against a real one.,
Look for other text.,
Ensure the signature is spelled correctly.,
Look for lots of variation in items with multiple autographs.",How to Spot a Fake Autograph1," To spot a fake autograph, you’ll need to be thoroughly familiar with the individual’s real signature. The best way to become familiar with their signature is to examine many authentic examples of their signature firsthand. This will allow you to identify the actual size and style of the signature they typically produced.If you don’t have any examples of an individual’s signature available for direct inspection, check online for authentic examples. For instance, look at autographs of the individual in question that are sold in major auction houses or by collectibles dealers.
Analyzing a large number of authentic signatures will also enable you to identify how variable someone’s autograph might be.
Try to find something unique about the autograph of the person you’re interested in. For instance, Barack Obama always makes the leading letters of his first and last name (“B” and “O”) very large relative to the sizes of the other letters.;
, Look closely at your autograph and several authentic examples of the same individual’s autograph. Look for discrepancies between the two. If the signature appears unnaturally shaky, this could be a sign of a fake. Other telltale signs of fakery could include:the width and length of individual letters
the space between letters
the position of dots in lowercase “J” and “I”
the general style of the handwriting (does it use cursive, print, or some combination?)
a dot in the middle of an individual character (this indicates the person stopped, then started the signature)

, If you’re trying to spot a fake autograph, doing so is easier when it is included along with a handwritten letter or an inscription. Looking at a larger sample of text allows you to evaluate other handwriting elements. This additional writing sample can help you confirm the autograph’s authenticity., In most cases, it’s reasonable to assume that in authentic autographs, the individual in question knew how to spell their own name. If the autograph you’re evaluating contains misspellings, it is likely a fake., If you’re evaluating a baseball signed by the whole team or a production photo signed by the whole cast of a film, the individual signatures should all look a bit different. For instance, the pen or marker strokes should be of varying thicknesses. Some lines will be thick, while others will be thin. Some signatures will probably overlap.Items that have multiple autographs, all of which are of a uniform thickness, are probably fake.

"
"
Know the date when the autograph was produced.,
Identify the provenance.,
Evaluate the ink or paper.,
Use an authenticator.,
Beware of machine signatures.",How to Spot a Fake Autograph2," Either consciously or unconsciously, many people change their signature over the years. Knowing when a given autograph was produced will help you spot a fake. Compare another autograph from the same time period to the one you’re, Knowing the provenance of the autograph means tracing the line of ownership back to the moment when the autograph was created. Ask the current owner of the autograph how they came to acquire it. If they claim they are not the first owner of the autograph, follow up with the person who sold them the autograph to find out more about its origin. Continue down the chain of ownership as far as possible.If you have a video or a photo that depicts the creation of the autograph you’re trying to verify, your job will be much easier. Just compare the autographed item in the video or photo to the actual object. If the two are different, you’ve spotted a fake.
If you’ve nobody to talk to about an autograph’s provenance, look for corroborating documents. For instance, if someone autographs a particular item and then writes in their diary that they did so, you could use that information to establish that the autograph is authentic.
You could also, in some cases, ask the supposed author of the autograph directly if they recognize the autograph as their own.

, If you’re evaluating an autograph of historical significance, the paper or ink from that era should be identifiable as such. Ensure that the ink or paper from the era in which the autograph was supposedly created is historically accurate.Paper produced between 1900 and 1945, for instance, was far less absorbent than paper today. If the autograph you’re evaluating purportedly dates from that period but shows a “bleeding effect” (an uneven ink trim around each character), the autograph was likely produced by a newer pen pressed against older paper, which was less absorbent than modern paper.Like most efforts to spot a fake autograph, this is far from foolproof. Forgers often go to great lengths to produce fake autographs. They might use special inks or blank pages that really date from the historical period in which the autograph was allegedly produced. They might also artificially age photos or papers to create the appearance that they are older than they really are., Almost every industry that produces autographed collectibles – sports, film, TV, and so on – also has at least one independent autograph authentication service. For instance, if you’re interested in autographs of golfers, you should get authenticated through the Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) or a similar organization., The only real way to identify whether a particular autograph is the product of an autopen or other machine signature device is to compare it to a known machine-produced signature. Lay the two signatures over each other on a light table or beneath a strong light source. If they align perfectly, both were machine-produced.Many people who use autopens or other mechanical signature machines to sign things have more than one signature loaded in the machine’s memory. In order to know for sure that a particular autograph was or was not produced by a machine, you need to know how many machine-produced versions of their autograph the individual in question used. Then, compare your autographed object or document against all known variations.
It is possible to have an authentic document that has been “signed” by autopen. In other words, a machine-signed letter from the president still qualifies as an example of presidential correspondence (though it will fetch far less than a document containing a hand-signed autograph).Machines that mechanically reproduce signatures are often used in business and government. Machine signatures are also found on books, sporting equipment, and photos.

"
"
Look for a flat appearance.,
Run your finger across the autograph.,
Try to remove the ink.",How to Spot a Fake Autograph3," Preprinted (also known as “reprinted”) autographs are high-quality photo scans of an authentic signed photo. They are often sold by celebrities or licensed to collectibles shops to save the celebrity time that would be used to sign multiple copies of a photo. Reprinted autographs are therefore part of the photo itself, and will appear to lie below the glossy surface of the photo.Hold the autograph close to a bright light. A handwritten autograph will reflect differently than the rest of the photo.

, If you can feel the texture of the ink on top of the photo, it could be fake. You might need some practice running your finger over signed photographs before you can identify reprint autographs.To familiarize yourself with the fine variation in texture of a photo that has been autographed, locate an old photo that you don’t mind damaging. Sign it with a similar (or identical) sort of ink. Run your finger along the surface of this “practice autograph” several times.
When you’ve familiarized yourself with the difference between the photo’s surface and the ink’s surface, run your finger over the autograph you’re evaluating.
Touching the photo could cause the ink to smudge and transfer oils from your skin that will, over time, cause the photo to degrade.

, Dip a cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and try to erase a bit of the signature. If you’re looking at a preprint autograph, you won’t be able to remove the ink. This method is not ideal, of course, because if you do have an authentic autograph, you will have erased some portion of it."

Collect away!",How to Collect Things," People do it for fun, or because the collected item might become valuable. You can make it as narrow or as broad a field as you like. There are three basic categories to choose from:


Free. This category often includes sentimental objects like postcards, or fun ones like bottle caps.
Inexpensive. This category may include baseball cards or figurines.
Expensive. This third category tends to be for expert collectors with items like art pieces, or antiques.;
, Whether you are collecting coins, dolls, or fossils being a serious collector can be expensive.


Single coins can sell from a few dollars to $3,000.
A doll can be found at a flea market or antique store for very little, or it could be a L’Oiseleur which runs the price tag of $6.25 million.

, There are a variety of different kinds of collections.



Stamps. Old coins. A coin collection could be early American pennies, foreign coins, Roman coins are only a few ideas.Books. Anything from modern books of poetry to limited first edition.

Fossils.

, Learn where it is best to find the item, how best to care for it.


For coins, books like The Everything Coin Collecting Book is a useful place to start.
Most collections have websites where collectors, enthusiasts and sellers have their wares.
Go to the library! Librarians can help you research your collection and find resources.
Items like dolls, coins, baseball cards and figurines can be found in hobby shops, flea markets, garage sales, antique stores and sometimes even your own attic.
When it comes to caring for your collection, make sure you are doing so properly. This is particularly important if you are creating a collection with the hopes that it will increase in value.

, Depending on its contents many countries may have restrictions on buying certain items.


A UNESCO resolution places restrictions on the movement of antiquities, including coins.
The U.S. and other countries have certain restrictions on firearms.

, For example, don't collect football cards if you find football boring. This is about your interests.

, This step is important for people who are trying to collect something that is, or will become, valuable.


Start by searching for someone in your neighborhood: a vendor you're familiar with, a flea market, an antique shop.
Associations like the American Society of Appraisers or International Society of Appraisers can connect you with the right person. Be prepared to pay for the service, although some auction houses may offer a free appraisal. Don't trust eBay. There is no easy way to verify someone's credentials.

, After all the time and energy you've put into creating your collection there are ways to make it so it can be seen and admired by others. Different collections have different needs when it comes to exhibition.


Occasionally museum and libraries carry works or collections of students or communities members. Talk to your local museum or library to see if they might be interested.
Most kinds of collections should be displayed out of the sun which can fade the objects in the collection.

Artwork, should be well lit, but out of direct light, especially natural light.
Coins are typically stored in albums and folders, in coin tubes and capsules. Capsules are best for individual coins, particularly for valuable ones. Albums and folders made exhibition easier.
For larger items, like dolls or fossils, use a glass fronted cabinet. Storing them in the open could damage them.

, This is, again, especially important if you are collecting with the hope of your collection being worth something. The better preserved the collection the more worth it will have. Knowledge is the most important component. Know how best to care for your collection.


Putting a doll in a plastic container can cause it to mold if moisture seeps in.
If you are collecting dolls you should make sure that you have the original clothes, particularly when it comes to antique dolls.

Cleaning coins might make them less valuable. Proceed with caution and handle them only by their edges with your thumb and forefinger. Artwork, especially, is affected by light, humidity, and temperature. Lighting is particularly difficult and it is recommended to use a mixture of halogen and incandescent light and avoid direct light. Temperature should be kept low and it is best to maintain as constant a humidity as possible. Do not store antique books in a basement or attic. Leather bound books can be destroyed by heat and humidity and gaseous pollutants. The best way to protect them is an archival, which can be purchased for under $10. Collected items should be kept out of the reach of children, animals, water damage and food damage.

, Coin collecting is one of the oldest hobbies. It possibly goes back to the Augustus during the Roman Empire. It has been a hobby of kings, as well as, a part of scholarly study. There are many different types of coin collections.


Coins of antiquity. In this category are Roman coins, Byzantine coins, Greek coins. These categories are further broken down into the different eras. You could join something like the Ancient Coin Collectors Guildto make connections and learn further. Many coins can be recognized by the Roman Emperor on the front. Early American coins. You could focus on a specific area, such as the small cent and only collect those coins, or you could do as Louis E. Eliasberg and attempt to create a complete collection of all American coins ever made. Some examples of early American coins include the Half Cent 1793-1857, the Large Cent 1793-1857, the Small Cent 1856-Date which we would recognize today as the penny. Be aware of issues of forgery and counterfeiting with coins. New technology has made it particularly easy to forge older coins. For early American coins make sure you are buying PCGS or NGC certified ones. Have them appraised. Always check the reputation of the seller. Try to buy from someone you trust.

, As with coins, there is a wide variety of dolls. You will need to specify your collection's focus. Look into the United Federation of Doll Clubs. They have events, education opportunities, workshops, vendors, and news on different dolls. Subscribe to a doll collecting magazine like Antique Doll Collector Magazine. Some different types of dolls there are china dolls, miniatures, cloth dolls, modern dolls, etc.
Learn the terms for various types and aspects of dolls. Auction sites might have the term ""A/O"" which means all original.
Each doll type needs its own level of care and expense. For instance, doll hair might be a wig or rooted in the doll's head. The hair can be made from synthetic materials, mohair, or human hair. Each requires a different type of cleaning.

, You don't even need to be a paleontologist to do so.


Types of fossils. The two categories of fossils are fossilized body parts and fossilized traces. Fossils break down into four types: mold (an impression of an animal or plant), cast (as when the mold fossil is filled in), trace (nest, burrow, footprint), and true form (the part or whole of the actual being).
Best places to find a fossil. Look for sedimentary rocks, in rivers, lakes and on the seafloor. Common sedimentary rocks are sandstone, limestone, and shale. In the United States Western United States, from Texas to Montana often reveals dinosaur fossils. In Britain, beaches and quarries are the best places to look. Pay close attention to cliff faces, under rocks, the tide line. Also, keep an eye out on a river bank. China has the Liaoning province, where paleontologists have unearthed a wide variety of fossils! Remember not to trespass and not to remove any rocks or fossils on land where it's prohibited. Also, don't steal from excavation sites.

, You now have the basics for choosing, researching, and caring for a collection.

"
"
Decide what you want to collect.,
Don't trust everything on an online auctioning/shopping website.,
Go on a site like Ebay and compare the reviews about the seller with the prices.,
See if the seller has other social media accounts.,
Look for last-minute deals.,
Know when new sets of things are coming out.,
If a certain card or figurine is going to go or is out of stock, act fast.,
When selling your doubles, see what other people on the site you are selling it on are trying to pay for it.,
Know if the item you want to sell is very rare.,
Don't bother selling unopened blind boxes.",How to Be a Committed Collector," Don't try to start collecting Pokémon cards now- they've been in print for years. Try something small- Grass 1 Series Minecraft figurines are the perfect kind of thing to collect. There are a lot out there, but not so many that you can't possibly ""catch 'em all"".;
, Check the reviews for each individual seller, and definitely look at what people are saying about the site itself. Ebay and Craigslist are fine, but many other sites are scams. Research any site and seller very carefully.

, The closer to 100% good reviews they have, the more you should trust them. Most sellers with high prices have fewer good reviews. Very established sellers tend to have low to mid-range prices and lots of good reviews.

, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the like are all even more ways to get an insight on who the seller is and if you should trust them or not. If a seller has a YouTube channel, this channel will most likely be them showing off their collection. This will give you a better idea about if clicking that ""Bid Now"" button is as good a decision as you thought.

, There is no rule against ""sniping"", so feel free to do it. ""Sniping"" or ""eBay Sniping"" means that you place your bid in the last seconds of the auction so that no one has enough time to respond to your bid. Sometimes, eBay will even have a ""Buy Now"" button where you will definitely get the item that would have been bid on.

, The whole point of being a collector is to have an extensive knowledge of your item, and to have every single one. You can set up a Google Alert with certain keywords, and Google will update you with the latest news about that topic in your Gmail.

, Within the first 24 hours of people having the knowledge that a certain card or figurine is going out of stock, sellers are going to skyrocket their prices, because they know that committed collectors will pay almost anything to get every single one in the set. Once something is said to be going out of stock, quickly go onto eBay or some other site and try to get the item.

, Go for something a little higher, maybe a few more cents, but offer something the other sellers don't offer, such as free shipping.

, It's basic math- rarer items sell for more. If you have 2 rare items and want to sell one, feel free to make your price higher.

, Simply open them up, and see what you get. If it is something you don't have, add it to your collection. If not, then sell it on eBay. Sometimes buyers want you to also sell the packaging in with it. If a majority of people ask you this, then add no more than a dollar to the overall cost, unless you really want to keep the box.

Decide how committed you want to be to shell collecting.,
Figure out which shells are common in your area.,
Figure out where you should be looking.,
Figure out when you should be looking.",How to Collect Shells1," If you just want some pretty seashells to bring home from vacation, you may not be as curious to learn the peak hours and locations to find particular shells. However, the more serious shell collectors may have specific shells they seek, in which case they will need to do a little more research.


Keep in mind that if you are a casual shell collector on vacation, you may have issues bringing your shells through airport security.;
, There are resources online to determine this. By knowing which shells are most prevalent near you, you’ll know exactly what to keep your eyes peeled for, and it can also give you an idea about how easy or difficult it will be to locate shells.


If you're committed to finding great shells, you may even consider traveling to find the best ones. If the shells are sparse where you live, or if you don't live near a beach, you can go to some beaches that are famous for their bounty. Sanibel Island, on Florida's Gulf Coast, is regarded by many as the best shell collecting spot in North America., Some beaches may be littered with shells, and a casual jaunt down the beach can result in a gorgeous variety. However, other beaches may be bare, and you’ll need to dig a little to find shells. Rocky beaches may contain more shell fragments than intact shells, so you may have to patiently sort through debris to find the shells you seek. In some places, you may even want to snorkel or scuba dive to find the coolest shells. The prime shell spots will vary depending on where you live or travel, so research and explore the beaches near you!, Just like hunting or fishing, there are prime times when you’re more likely to find the shells you’re after. When the tide is low, you’ll be able to search for shells that may be covered by water during high tide. More beach is exposed, so low tide is a great time for a shell collecting excursion.


Tides are caused by gravitational forces between the earth and moon.Tide levels and times depend on where you’re located, so it’s best to look online or in your local paper for tide charts for your area before you head off to collect shells.
Different varieties of shells often wash ashore during big storms, so you can find some gems if you head to the beach right after bad weather."
"
Wear the proper clothing and footwear.,
Bring a bucket, a net, a spade, a filter, and other tools you may need.,
Wear sunscreen and a hat.,
Leave shells with living creatures alone.",How to Collect Shells2," If you’re going to be wading deep into water, you may want to wear a bathing suit and skip the footwear all together. If you’re going shell collecting on rocky terrain, you may want to wear sneakers and comfortable clothing.


Keep in mind that sometimes your feet can be as useful as your hands when collecting shells. By digging into wet mud or sand with your toes, you may be able to find shells that are not visible above surface.
On that note, be careful so you don’t cut yourself on sharp edges.

, You’ll need a bucket to hold all of your new treasures. If you’re interested in searching in deeper waters, using a net to scoop up sand will be more effective than digging around with your hands. With a spade or shovel you can dig out shells you find deep in the ground. A filter or screen can be used to sift through sand and mud. Once you know the habitat and the shells you’ll be collecting, you can determine which tools to bring along with you.

, Nothing ruins a great day collecting shells in the outdoors like a painful, peeling sunburn. Make sure to protect yourself from the glaring sun, especially if you get distracted in your search for shells. A hat or sunglasses can also help shade you from the sun and make it easier to spot shells.

, This is considered proper etiquette among shell collectors. There are beautiful shells that are empty or have a dead creature inside, and those are yours for the taking. If there is a living creature inside a shell you’ve found, give it a chance to live. If it’s washed up, put it back in the surf."
"
Clean your shells.,
Learn about your shells.,
Display your shells.",How to Collect Shells3," Depending on where you’ve collected them from, they may be covered in dirt or grime, or even animal tissue. Gently washing your shells can make them look beautiful for your display or collection, and can also remove any odor that may linger. You’ll need dishwashing liquid soap, warm water, an old toothbrush, some rags, WD-40 or another lubricant, and possibly tweezers to clean your shells up.Scrub your shell with warm water and dish soap using the toothbrush. The brush is great to get into all the ridges and crevices of the shell. You can use the tweezers to pick out any stuck debris or barnacles.
Dry your shells with the rags, and use the WD-40 to shine them up.
If your shell has animal tissue attached, you may need to boil it for a few minutes before beginning the cleaning process. Boiling it will loosen up the tissue, and you can use the tweezers to pull out the tissue.

, While it’s easy to admire shells for their aesthetic beauty, learning about them can give them a whole new layer. Seashells.com provides a thorough shell identification guide, complete with photographs, and you can learn all about the different types of shells you’ve collected. You can show off your newfound knowledge by creating labels and informational cards for each shell, or just learn about them for fun., There are several great ways to display your new collection. Some collectors fill a clear jar or vase with your treasures, and use it as décor in their home. If you’d rather display your collection methodically with labels, boxes with dividers work excellently. Those can be found at most container stores or craft stores.If you want to keep your shells pristine, keep them away from direct sunlight. Shells react differently to bright light, but many are damaged by too much.
The oil from human skin can also cause wear and tear to the shells. Clear display cases are great to show off your shells without constantly handling them.

Request.,
Wait.,
Buy.",How to Buy Rare Books," Know exactly what you are looking for. Vague memories of an ""old brown book about a dog"" just won't do, especially in the rare book field. Know who, what, when, where, and why! This includes having a complete and accurate description to offer potential book scouts and dealers, a full or partial title, the author's name, and the year it was first published. Helpful (but not crucial) ancillary information includes the name of the publishing house, co-authors or editors, and illustrators. Decide if you will or won't accept alternative editions, such as one with a different illustrator, or a later reprint of the book by a different publisher. Also, it is helpful to all concerned to obtain beforehand as much bibliographical information as possible on the production of the book, often referred to as “points,” in order to correctly identify the right book.;
, Scarce books, or those that are relatively uncommon, are very rarely seen for sale on the open market, or are very rarely seen in better-than-good condition. By their very nature, rare books show up on the market sporadically and can be very expensive because of when, where, and how many were published, and how many are available today for purchase. A fine example of this would be Shakespeare’s First Folio. This is considered a “rare” book due to many factors, including its importance in the world of literature, the date it was published (1623), the number published (fewer than 500), how many have survived to this day (223 known) and how many are available for purchase in any given year (fewer than 3). Reputable sellers such as Ken Lopez may either have what you seek or will know how to find it for you. Talking to experts in the field, either in person or on collectors' internet forums, may also be a great help.

, Develop a relationship with a reputable bookseller who has earned certification from the Antiquarian Booksellers' of America (ABAA) or other bodies, such as the International League of Antiquarian Booksellers (ILAB or LILA). Ask a bookseller to look for the book for you, or place the book on a “want list” with several internet booksellers of some repute, such as Ken Lopez, Between the Covers, or The Quill and Brush. Certified antiquarian book dealers have both the resources and information to guide you to your book, along with a reputation for fair dealing.

, Most online book sites allow you to list ""wants."" Put in requests at several of these sites, especially ABE.com and AddALL.com, which contain listings from used and rare book dealers from all over the world. Ken Lopez, Between the Covers, or The Quill and Brush also gladly accept your wants lists. All of these sites will notify you when items fitting your description are listed. And if you are collecting in a specific area of books, rare booksellers can also ""keep an eye out"" for items which may be of interest to you.

, Be patient. A copy of your chosen book should turn up eventually, but be prepared to pay top dollar for your prize. Price is driven by supply and demand, and rare books are often in low supply and high demand. Rare books are often traded on the open market, and entire collections in various categories can, and do, go up for sale.

, If a dealer finds the book for you, be prepared to pay the agreed-on price. If the book is very expensive, you can ask diplomatically if there is any leeway on the price, but don't expect to get any discounts unless you are a regular customer. Do not ask booksellers to find books for you or to discount prices unless you are a serious, legitimate buyer. Auction houses such as Bloomsbury, Heritage, and Christie's are also places to shop around for rare books; be prepared to add a closing fee or ""hammer price"" at auction houses.

You'll need approximately five skeins of super bulky (level 6) yarn and an M-13 (9.0 mm) or larger crochet hook.
The yarn gauge isn't crucial for this project since you can alter the pattern as you go along, but for best results, note that eight stitches should produce 4 inches (10 cm) of material.;
, Chain stitch 85 times to create the foundation of your sweater.


This foundation chain will match the overall sweater length, not the sweater width.
Alter the number of chain stitches as desired to change the length of the sweater to your preference. On an adult woman of average height, 85 chains should create a sweater that drapes from the shoulder to the upper-mid thigh.

, Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook and into each of the remaining chains across your foundation row.


Turn your work once you reach the end of the row.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into each of the stitches in the previous row, working each single crochet into the back loops only.


The back loops are the loops that are furthest away from you as you work across the row. By working only in the back loops, you will give the final sweater a ribbed texture.
Once you reach the end of the row, turn the work over to the other side.

, Continue working additional rows of crochet that are identical to the second row. Repeat until you have approximately 38 inches (96.5 cm) of material width.


Expect to work 50 to 60 rows in this manner. You don't need to keep count, though, since the final measurement is more important than the precise number of rows.
For each row, chain one at the beginning and single crochet once into the back loops of each stitch. Turn once you reach the end of the row.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail that matches the approximate length of your overall sweater piece. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off your stitches.


Do not trim the tail or weave it under your stitches yet. You'll use this yarn to stitch up one side of your sweater.

, Fold the rectangle in half so that the rows run vertically.


The width of the rectangle should not change once you fold it, but the length will temporarily halve.

, Using a yarn needle and the remaining tail of yarn, whip stitch along two-thirds of one vertical side.


Leave approximately 7 to 8 inches (18 to 20 cm) of space in between the fold and your final whip stitch. This space will create the armhole of the sweater, so it should be about as long as half the circumference of your upper arm.
It may help to measure out the armhole length and mark the bottom with a stitch marker before stitching along the side.

, Using fresh yarn and a yarn needle, whip stitch along two-thirds of the other vertical side.


The stitched portion of this side should match the stitched portion of the other side, and both open armholes should measure the same length.
Both stitched seams should fall beneath your arms when you put on the sweater.

, Trim each excess yarn tail to a length of 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm). Weave the tails into the underside of the surrounding stitches.


Once you complete this step, the main body of the sweater is done. You can actually stop here and wear the sweater as it is if you do not wish to include a collar or sleeve edging.

, Use stitch markers to tag the upper midline, start point, and end point of your collar.


To find the upper midline, lay the sweater flat with the opening facing you. The upper midline is the halfway point along the top width of the sweater.
The start and end points should mirror one another. They should be about three-quarters down the length of the sweater, or 10 to 15 rows beneath the arm seam. If desired, you can try the sweater on in front of a mirror and visually mark the points that look best.

, Starting with new yarn, crochet a series of slip stitches, single crochets, half double crochets, and double crochets. This base should span between your starting marker and your upper midline marker.


Attach the yarn to your sweater using a slip stitch.
Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches, single crochet once into each of the next two stitches, and half double crochet once into each of the two stitches after that.
Double crochet once into each of the remaining stitches until you reach your upper midline marker, keeping count as work.
Double crochet once into the midline stitch.

, Reverse the previous pattern from the midline point to the end point. Once you reach the end point, you've completed the first collar row.


Repeat the same number of double crochet across the row, stopping once there are only six stitches left.
Half double crochet once into each of the next two stitches, single crochet once into each of the two stitches after that, and slip stitch once into the final two stitches.
Slip stitch once to the next stitch just outside of your stitch marker, then turn the work over.

, Alternate back and forth between front post double crochet and back post double crochet along the second row.


Before you reach the ribbing, you'll need to build the base. Slip stitch once into each of the first two stitches, single crochet twice into the next two stitches, and half double crochet into each of the two stitches after that.
Alternate back and forth between front post double crochet and back post double crochet, working only one of either option into each stitch across the row. Continue until only six stitches remain.
For the last six stitches, mirror the starting pattern: half double crochet into each of the first two stitches, single crochet into each of the next two stitches, and slip stitch into each of the final two stitches.
Slip stitch once into the base of the row, then turn the work over.

, The third row follows the same pattern as the second row, but the back post double crochets and front post double crochets should be reversed.


Slip stitch into two stitches, single crochet into two stitches, and half double crochet into two stitches.
Alternate back and forth between back post double crochet and front post double crochet until only six stitches remain.
Half double crochet into two stitches, single crochet into two stitches, and slip stitch into two stitches.
Slip stitch into the base of the row and turn the work.

, The fourth row should be worked in a pattern that is identical to the second row.


Slip stitch into two stitches, single crochet into two stitches, and half double crochet into two stitches.
Alternate between front post double crochet and back post double crochet until only six stitches remain.
Half double crochet into two stitches, single crochet into two stitches, and slip stitch into two stitches.
Slip stitch into the base of the row.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail of 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm). Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.


Weave the remaining excess into the underside of your stitches.
This step completes the collar. If desired, you can wear the sweater as it is without completing the sleeve edging.

, Use a slip stitch to join new yarn to the sweater at the arm seam, then single crochet once into each stitch around the entire armhole.


Begin and end at the arm seam. Once you reach the end of the round, slip stitch the last single crochet to the first.

, Double crochet once into each stitch across the round.


When you reach the end of the round, slip stitch the last and first double crochets together.

, Chain four, then double crochet once into the original stitch at base of the chain.


Afterward, chain two, then double crochet once into the next stitch. Repeat this pattern all the way around the third and final round.
Slip stitch the final double crochet to the third chain in your chain-four.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the edging.


Weave the remaining tail into the underside of your stitches.

, Repeat the same pattern around the other armhole to create identical edging.


Once you finish the edging on both armholes/sleeves, the entire sweater is complete and ready to wear.

,
Record the length of the heel as half of the width of the foot, such as 3.5 inches (8.9 cm) divided by 2 equals 1.75 inches (4.4 cm).

,
Record the length of the sock as the length of the foot minus the length of the heel, such as 9.5 inches (24.1 cm) minus 1.75 inches (4.4 cm) equals 7.75 inches (19.7 cm).

,,,, In other words, do not join the last stitch of each row to the beginning stitch; just continue around over the top of the first stitch.

, Chain 9, 3 sc in the first st, sc in the next 6 stitches, 3 sc in the last st. Continue around the back side of these previous stitches, sc in the next 6 stitches. An oval shape will have formed. Continue to increase 2 sc at each end of the oval until you have increased to the desired width of the foot.

,, In example: continue with 28 sc around the sock, forming a cylinder, until the piece measures 7.75 inches (19.7 cm) for the length of the sock. Be sure that the number of rows on the front of the sock is equivalent to those on the back of the sock.

,, The heel is made on the back half of the sock. Divide the number of sc around the sock by 2, such as 28 divided by 2 equals 14. Working only on these 14 sc, decrease one sc at the beginning and one sc at the end of ""every other"" row until the desired length of the heel. There should be about 10 sc remaining in the final decrease row. Then begin to increase one sc at the beginning and one sc at the end of ""every other"" row until 14 sc remain in the final increase row. Decrease rows should be equivalent to increase rows. The heel will resemble an hourglass, wide at the top and bottom and narrow in the center.

,,, With right sides together, fold the heel in half at the narrowest part of the hourglass. Stitch the sides together using a yarn needle and the same color yarn. Make a very solid stitch where each strand of yarn is directly next to the other. Turn the heel right side out. The base of the sock is now complete with an opening for the foot. It should resemble a slipper.

, Sc around the top of the opening until the desired length of the calf.

,, The cuff is made to stretch. Sc in the back loop of the next sc. Sc in the front loop of the next sc. Continue to alternate back loop sc and front loop sc.

If necessary, please see the ""Tips"" section for instructions on how to make a slipknot.;
, From the loop on your hook, work a series of chain stitches to form the foundation row of your scarf.


Continue chaining until the length reaches the length you desire for your scarf. As a general rule, 180 chains will work well for an adult-size scarf and 90 chains will work well for a child-size scarf.
If you need further instruction on making chain stitches, please see the ""Tips"" section.

, Work one double crochet into the second chain currently from the hook.


This is the start of your first working row.
See the ""Tips"" section if you need help with the double crochet stitch.

, Work one double crochet into the next chain, then two double crochet in the chain after that.


Repeat this pattern across the entire chain. When you reach the end of the chain, you've completed your first row.
Note that the row can end on either a set of one double crochet or two double crochet, depending on how many chains are in your foundation row. Both options are acceptable.

, For the second row, work two double crochet in each double crochet of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row.

, For each consecutive row, follow the technique used to complete the second row. Work as many rows as needed to achieve the scarf width you desire.


You can make the scarf as thin or wide as you wish, but a total of three to six rows will usually suffice.

, When you reach the final stitch of the final row, cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.

, Work two double crochet into the third chain currently from the hook.


When counting chains, do not count the loop already on your hook.
See the ""Tips"" section for more information on making the double crochet stitch.

, Skip two chains, then double crochet three times into the chain after that.


Repeat this pattern across the entire row. If done correctly, you should have worked three double crochets into the final chain of your foundation row.

, Chain three at the end of the row, then work three double crochets into each chain-two space you created during your first pass.


Once you reach the beginning of the row again, slip stitch once into the top of your original chain-three. This completes the first full row.
See the “Tips” section if you need instruction on creating slip stitches.

, Chain three at the start of the row. Work a series of double crochets into each space of the previous row.


For each space:

Work three double crochets.
Chain three.
Work three double crochets into the same space.


Repeat this pattern all the way down the row. Work this same pattern in the corner of the first row, as well.

, Once you reach the end of the row, double back by working the same pattern into each space just created by your first pass through the second row.


Continue back down the row in this manner, but do not work this pattern into the last space of the row.

, In the last space of the row, work three double crochets. Chain three, then work two double crochets into the same space.


Note that your initial chain-three of this second row counts as a double crochet stitch, which is why you should only make two double crochets at the end instead of the three used in every other space.
After working these stitches, slip stitch into the top of the chain-three made at the beginning of your second row.

, Chain three at the beginning of the row, then work an alternating series of double crochet into each chain-three space of your previous row.


In the first space:

To measure waist size, wrap a soft measuring tape around the narrowest part of your torso, which is usually located in between the rib cage and navel. Keep the measuring tape taut but not tight, and make sure that it remains parallel to the ground.
The default instructions are for a small waist measuring 32 inches (81 cm), but necessary changes for medium/34-inch (86 cm), large/37-inch (94 cm), and extra-large/39-inch (99 cm) sizes are noted, where applicable, in the substeps.

, Double crocheting 13 stitches should produce 4 inches (10 cm) of length, and eight rows of double crochet should create 4 inches (10 cm) of width.

For best results, use a worsted weight or light worsted weight yarn.
Try a G-6 (4 mm) crochet hook. If the gauge is too large, switch to a smaller hook and test it again. If the gauge is too small, switch to a larger hook and check it again.
Use the same yarn and hook for all three skirt parts (waistband, skirt body, and edging).

, Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of seven chain stitches.
, Single crochet once into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each remaining chain of your foundation.

At the end of the row, chain one. Turn the work over.

, For the second row, work one single crochet into each single crochet of the previous row.

At the end of the row, chain one and turn the work.

, Continue to work rows of single crochet until you reach a length that matches your measured waist size.

You should use a measuring tape to check the length of your waistband, but as a general guideline, make 140 rows for a small, 148 rows for a medium, 156 rows for a large, or 164 rows for an extra-large.
Note that you will need to make button holes on every sixth and eighth row. See the next step for more details.

, Create a button hole on every sixth and eighth row across the waistband.

To work a button hole:

Single crochet once into the first two stitches.
Chain two.
Skip two stitches.
Single crochet once into each of the last two stitches.
Chain one and turn as usual.


For each row following a button hole row, work one single crochet into each single crochet and two single crochet into the chain-two space.

, After your final row of single crochet, match the first and last edges, then slip stitch each pair of stitches together.

The stitches of both ends must line up evenly when you slip stitch them together.
Completing this step should form a loop.
Turn the band so that the slip stitch faces the inside. From now on, keep in mind that the slip stitch should face the “wrong” side of the skirt.

, Turn the work so that the long edge faces you. Chain one, then single crochet once into each stitch along the side.

The total number of single crochet in this step should match the total number of rows previously worked for the length of the waistband.
After you complete this step, the waistband is complete. Do not fasten off the yarn, however.

, Chain three, then work one double crochet into each single crochet around the length of your waistband.

At the end of the round, join the last double crochet to the chain-three using a slip stitch.
Note that the chain-three at the start of the row counts as your first double crochet stitch and should be treated as such. The same is also true of all other chain-three stitches that occur at the beginning of a round.

, Chain three, then double crochet once into each double crochet of the previous row. Join the first and last stitches together with a slip stitch.

After completing the second round, place six stitch markers evenly around the round. This will be approximately every 23 stitches for a small, 25 stitches for a medium, 26 stitches for a large, and 27 stitches for an extra-large

, Chain three. Double crochet once into each stitch until you reach the first stitch marker, then work one double crochet decrease.

Repeat the same pattern across the entire round. Work one double crochet into each unmarked stitch and one double crochet decrease into each marked stitch (and the one that follows it).
By the time you reach the end of the round, your stitch count should decrease by six.
At the end of the round, slip stitch the first and last stitches together.
To make a double crochet decrease:Yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the marked stitch.
Yarn over the hook and pull a loop back through to the front.
Yarn over again and pull the yarn through two loops on your hook.
Yarn over, then insert the hook into the next stitch.
Yarn over again and draw another loop back through to the front.
Yarn over and pull through two loops on the hook again.
Yarn over one last time and pull through all remaining loops on your hook



, Chain three, then work one double crochet into each stitch of the previous round.

Join the first and last stitches of the round with another slip stitch.

, For the next five rounds, double crochet once into each stitch of the row immediately before the current round.

Chain three at the start of each row and slip stitch the first and last stitches of each row together.
At the end of the ninth round, place six stitch markers evenly around the round. This will be approximately every 22 stitches for a small, every 24 stitches for a medium, every 25 stitches for a large, and every 26 stitches for an extra-large.

, Repeat the third round of the skirt body. At the end of the round, your total stitch count should decrease by six.

Chain three at the beginning of the round and slip stitch the last and first stitches together once you reach the end of the round.
Double crochet decrease into each marked stitch and the stitch that follows it.
Double crochet once into each of the other stitches across the round.

, Chain three, then double crochet once into each stitch of the previous round. Join the last stitch of the round to the first using a slip stitch.

Your stitch count should not decrease in this round or in any round that follows.

, Work rounds of double crochet until you reach your desired length.

Chain three at the beginning of each round and slip stitch each round closed. Work one double crochet into each stitch of the round immediately before your current round.
Do not fasten off the yarn at the end of the skirt body unless you do not plan to add the decorative edging. If you do wish to include the edging, keep the yarn intact.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch of the last skirt body round. At the end of the round, slip stitch the last stitch of this round to the chain-one.

Note that these instructions use the same yarn for both the skirt and the edging. For an easy variation, you could fasten off the yarn at the end of the skirt body and join a second color using a slip stitch. After joining the new color, follow this steps and all the others as instructed.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into the first stitch of the previous round., Work four chain stitches. After the fourth chain, work one slip stitch into the first chain. This creates one bump or picot.

For a smaller picot, only work three chains. For a larger picot, work five chains.

, Work one single crochet into each of the next four stitches.

Assuming you had 128 (small), 136 (medium), 144 (large), or 152 (extra-large) stitches at the end of your skirt body, you'll need to work one picot into every four stitches. If your final skirt body stitch count varied, change the edging pattern so that the picots will be spaced evenly apart around the bottom of the skirt.

, As before, work four chain stitches, then slip stitch into the first of these chains.

If you used a different number of chains in your first picot, continue using that same number for this picot and each one that follows.

, Single crochet once into each stitch. Work one picot into every four stitch. Continue this pattern until you reach the end of the round.

At the end of the round, slip stitch the last single crochet together with the first.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.

Weave the remaining excess into the underside of the skirt.

, Slide a ribbon through the button holes in the waistband of the skirt. Use this ribbon to tie the skirt on when worn.

To prevent the ribbon from fraying, clip the ends into a ""v"" shape and/or apply seam sealant to the ends.
Alternatively, slide a belt through the button holes instead of the ribbon.
Completing this step completes the project.

, Use a slipknot to attach the yarn to your crochet hook.


Leave a starting chain roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long.

, Work a strand of four to nine chain stitches from the loop already on your hook.


Use four chain stitches for a dog's tail or nine chain stitches for a cat's tail.
This tail is very simple and consists only of this one chain. You can make the tail longer or shorter as desired by working more or fewer chain stitches.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3 inch (7.6 cm) tail. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.


After knotting the chain, you may want to trim the excess or weave it into the stitches. You'll use the starting yarn tail to attach this tailpiece to the body of the cat or dog.

, Cut a small oval or triangle out of black felt to create a nose for the stuffed animal.


The nose should be about 1/5 inch (5 mm) long.
You can change the color of the felt as desired to match the yarn color used for the body of the stuffed animal.

, Cut two small felt circles from black felt to make two eyes. These felt circles should be slightly larger than the one created for the nose.


You can change the color of the felt if desired.
The exact size of the eyes should be a matter of preference, but they can range be anywhere from the same size as the nose to a size twice as large.

, Place the ears on the top of the body, keeping them even with one another. Use the yarn needle and excess yarn tails to whip stitch them into place.


Bear and cat ears should rest between the second and fourth rows of the body.
Dog ears should rest below fifth or sixth round of the body and should be positioned so that they extend from the sides of the head, rather than sticking up from the top.
Note that the top of the body is the end opposite the whip stitched portion of the body.

, Place the tail three or four rows up from the bottom of the body and whip stitch it into place using the yarn needle.


Make sure that the tail is horizontally centered between the two ears.
You also need to make sure that the animal can sit flat once the tail is stitched in place. If not, you may need to move it up a little.

, Use your yarn needle to whip stitch two paws onto the bottom of the animal and two paws onto its front.


The two bottom paws should be positioned just below round 13 of the body. They should be a little lower than the tail and positioned toward the front of the body.
The two top paws should be below the eighth round of the body and angled inward.

, Glue the eyes in place first, followed by the nose. Use fabric glue or hot glue for best results.


The eyes should be in line with the sixth round of the body.
The nose should be horizontally centered between the two eyes on the row below them.

, At this point, your tiny stuffed teddy bear, dog, or cat should be complete and ready to adore.

A size H crochet hook.
Scissors;
, Start by making a slipknot for your first loop on the hook. You can make a slipknot by looping yarn around your index and middle finger twice and then pulling one loop through the other. Slide this loop onto your hook and then make a chain of four.To make a chain, simply loop the yarn over the hook and pull it through the second loop on the hook. Keep doing this until you have a chain of four.

, Next, you will need to connect the chain of four into a circle with a slipstitch. To slipstitch, insert the hook into the first link in the chain, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through both loops.Now you should have a chain circle. You will be working into the center of the circle to create your shamrock petals.

, Start your first shamrock petal by making a chain of four extending from the chain circle. This chain will be the outer edge of your first shamrock petal., Next, triple crochet into the center of the circle. This will be your longest stitch and it will form the outer edges of your petal.To triple crochet:


Loop the yarn around the hook twice.
Then, insert the hook into the center of the circle and loop the yarn over again.
Pull the yarn through the center of the circle, and the yarn over again.
Pull the yarn through the first two stitches on the hook.
Then, yarn over again and pull through the next two stitches on the hook.
Finally, yarn over again and pull through the remaining stitches on the hook to complete a triple crochet stitch., The next stitch in the petal will be a double crochet stitch into the center of the circle. This stitch will be a little shorter than the triple crochet stitch, so it will create a slight indent in the petal, which is common for shamrocks.To double crochet:


Start by looping the yarn around the hook once.
Then, insert the yarn into the center of the circle and yarn over again.
Pull the yarn through the center of the circle and yarn over again.
Then, pull through the first two loops on the hook.
Yarn over again, and pull through the last two loops. This will complete your double crochet stitch., For your next stitch, do another triple crochet stitch into the center of the circle. This stitch will create the second raised area of your petal., To finish your first shamrock petal, make another chain of four and then slipstitch into the center of the circle to connect it. This will complete your first petal.Make two more petals just like this one to complete your shamrock petals.

, To start the stem, make a chain of seven extending from the center of your shamrock. This will be the base of your shamrock stem.If desired, you can make the stem a little longer or shorter.

, To give the stem a thicker base, start by doing a half double crochet stitch into the third chain from the hook.To do a half double crochet stitch:


Loop the yarn over the hook and insert it into the third chain from the hook.
Then, pull the yarn through this first loop and yarn over again.
Then, pull through all three loops on the hook to complete the stitch., After the half double crochet stitch, all you need to do is slipstitch along the chain and up to the center of the shamrock. When you reach the center, you can cut your yarn a few inches away from the hook, pull it through to secure it, and then tie your starting and ending yarn pieces together to secure them.Your shamrock is now complete! Pin it on your shirt, sweater, or jacket with a safety pin to wear it, or make several shamrocks and then use a piece of yarn and a large eyed crochet needle to make a garland to wear or to decorate your home. Thread the yarn through the needle and then string the shamrocks onto the yarn.

These will look like small rectangular spaces large enough to easily put your hook through. Count five of these loops and then fold you’re your yarn., With the folded over piece of yarn behind your working yarn, insert your hook through the first loop.For these first few stitches, you will be working through the folded over yarn as well, so you will really be going through two loops.

, After getting the first two loops on your hook, skip over the next loop and then insert the hook through the one after that (make sure to get the front and back loop) and chain one.Repeat this four times.
To chain with sashay yarn, insert the hook through a loop and then through another. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop on your hook., After you finish four stitches, turn your work and then begin working single crochet stitches into the loops. Do your first single crochet stitch in the first chain stitch in your row.Single crochet every other stitch to the end of your row.
To single crochet with sashay yarn, insert the crochet hook into the first stitch and then through a loop on your working yarn. Pull the loop through the first stitch. Then, insert the hook through another loop in your working yarn and pull through both of the other loops on your hook.Continue to turn and single crochet across every row until your scarf is the desired length. You can make a ruffle scarf with just one ball of sashay yarn, but you may make it longer if you prefer.

, Once you reach the end of the scarf, cut the yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15.25-cm) tail.


Tuck this tail end in between the nearest two ruffles. Use a sewing needle and thread to tack the end in place, securing it and preventing the scarf from unraveling.
This completes your ruffle scarf.

Use sashay yarn.,
Choose an appropriate hook size.,
Use stitch markers.",How to Crochet a Ruffle Scarf3," You will need to use a special kind of yarn to make a ruffle scarf. This yarn is called sashay yarn and it looks like a long strip of mesh when you unfurl it. Choose a sashay yarn in the color of your choice.

You can use another type of yarn that is designed to create ruffles as well. For example, you could try using a ribbon yarn or a chiffon yarn., You will also need to use a crochet hook that is appropriate for your sashay yarn. Check the yarn label to see what size hook is recommended.

A size J-10 (6mm) or K-10 (6.5mm) hook should work well for this project., Sashay yarn can be a little tricky to work with because of all of the loops. Placing stitch markers to indicate where you started working and where each of your rows begins and ends can help to make working with this yarn a little easier."

You will need:Medium worsted weight yarn in the color(s) of your choice. You will need at least one ball of yarn, and possible three or four depending on how big the yarn balls are and long you want to make your scarf.
Size H crochet hook. This is a good size for working with medium worsted weight yarn. If you end up choosing a different type of yarn, then be sure to check the label for recommendations about what hook size works best with that kind of yarn.
Scissors
Crochet needle (optional, for weaving in tail and embellishing);
, To make a medium width scarf with medium worsted weight yarn and a size H crochet hook, begin by chaining 34 stitches.Make a slipknot first by looping the yarn around your fingers twice and then pulling the second loop through the first. Then, slide the slipknot onto the hook and tighten it. Make the first chain by looping the yarn over the hook and pulling it through the slipknot.Continue to loop the yarn over and pull through until you have a chain of 34.
Keep in mind that you can chain more or less stitches if you want the chain to be wider or narrower.

, Chain two stitches to begin the first row of single crochet stitches. This will be your turning chain. Always start your rows with a chain of two and then turn your work around before you begin working the single crochet stitch.


To single crochet, insert the hook into the third stitch from the hook and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete your first single crochet stitch.Continue to single crochet all stitches to the end of the row.

, To add a bit of simple variation to your scarf, you can work the next row in the double crochet stitch. Remember to chain two before each new row, and then turn your work around.


To make your first double crochet stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook into the third stitch from the hook and yarn over again. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook, and then yarn over again. Pull through the next two stitches, and then yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete your first double crochet stitch.Continue to double crochet all stitches to the end of the row.

, Switch back and for the between single and double crochet stitches to complete your scarf. Keep crocheting until the scarf is as long as you want it to be. In general, scarves should be fairly long, around five feet so that you can wrap them around your neck several times and still have some scarf hanging on either side.

, Once your scarf is the desired length, cut the tail a few inches away from the end and then tie it off to secure it. You may want to tie it a few times to be sure that it is secure. You can cut the excess or weave the tail into the edge of the scarf using a crochet needle.

, There are many different types of scarves that you can make by following a pattern. Consider what type of scarf you would like to make and then use a pattern to create it.


Swirl scarf
V-stitch scarf
Chevron scarf
Hooded scarf
Granny Rectangle Scarf

, There are many different decorative stitches that you can choose from to create a unique scarf. Some stitches you might consider include:


Popcorn stitch
Box stitch
Textured shell stitch
Cluster stitch

, An infinity scarf is one that connects to form a circle. You can turn a standard scarf into an infinity scarf by connecting the ends. If you would like to turn your scarf into an infinity scarf, then thread a crochet needle with the same color yarn you used to make your scarf and then weave the ends together.


Then, tie the end of the yarn through a stitch to secure it and snip the excess to complete your infinity scarf!

, Fringe is a common decorative feature of scarves. To add fringe, you will need to cut many pieces of yarn to the same length and tie them in knots at the ends of the scarf. Try using a color that complements the scarf or that matches it.For example, if your scarf is red and gold, then you can use red and gold yarn to match. Or, if your scarf is black, then try adding white fringe for some contrast.

, Topstitching is just what it sounds like. It is the process of stitching on the surface layer of a crocheted project rather than stitching through it. You can thread a crochet needle with some contrasting yarn and stitch polka dots, stripes, or even initials into your scarf to embellish it.


You can also try single or double crocheting around the edges of your scarf to add an interesting accent, or if you want to get advanced, then you could try a triple picot border.

Get a crotchet hook.,
Take the working yarn (not the hanging piece, called the tail) and place it over the hook.,
Repeat this 15-20 times until you have your desired length.,
Pick your width of pouch.,
Proceed your crocheting based on the following sizes:


Single:

Insert hook through the first loop hanging from it.,Keep repeating rows until you think your square is big enough to fold over to hold pencils.,
Cut a long piece of yarn off at the end of your last row so that you can have a leftover tail to stitch into the project.,
Fold your pouch hot dog style and sew up the edges with yarn that can blend in to the project.,
Grab your crochet needle and thread the yarn through the eye.,Loop a knot at the end of the seam.,
Stitch in any tails left in the piece.",How to Crochet a Pencil Pouch," Tie a loop in the yarn and insert the hook in it.
, Hook the yarn through the loop you made., For longer pouches, you can repeat a few more times if you want.

Now you have a long chain of loops! That's good--this is how long your piece is going to be length wise. The width is determined by the following steps.

, If you want a standard pouch, use single crochet. A medium pouch, double crochet. A jumbo pouch? Treble crochet. Once you picked your size, it's time to start crocheting.,
Snag the working yarn (held in other hand) with the hook and pull it through that same loop. (There should be 2 yarn threads on the crochet hook).
Snag the working yarn again and pull it through those 2 loops.
Insert into next loop and repeat until the end.
At the last loop, chain 1 (snag working yarn and pull it through loop on the hook) and repeat the same process.
(You chain 1 after every row or else you won't get a square pencil pouch.)



Double:

Wrap yarn two times around hook and then insert the hook through the first loop hanging from it.
Snag working yarn with hook and pull it through that loop. There should be three loops on the crochet hook.
Yarn over again and pull it through two loops on the hook.
Yarn over again and pull it through the last two loops.
Yarn over 2x and repeat this for the whole row.
At the end, chain 2.
Begin all other rows with wrapping the yarn twice around the hook and ending rows by chaining 2.



Triple:

Wrap yarn three times at beginning of row. Snag working yarn and pull it through the first loop hanging from the hook. There should be four loops on the crochet hook.
Yarn over and pull hook through first two loops.
Yarn over and pull hook through second two loops.
Yarn over and pull hook through last two loops.
Yup. There it is!
Yarn over three times and repeat for whole row.
At the end, chain 3.
Begin all other rows w/wrapping the yarn 3x around the hook and ending rows by chaining three.



,, If you cut off too little a piece, your pencil pouch could unravel! Maybe 4–5 inches (10.2–12.7 cm) long is good enough., Most preferably, stick with the same yarn, but if you're a beginner, you might want to use a contrasting color so you can see the stitches., Make whip stitches all the way up each side. (Think over, under, over, under.),, It's best to use the tails to tie a knot with the project and cut off the remaining yarn.

The top will be open. If you want a zipper, there are some that can be stitched in. However, sewing in a button or multiple buttons can work just as well. Make it your own.

See the ""Tips"" section for more information regarding the single crochet stitch.

, Work one half double crochet stitch into both loops of the next chain. Work one double crochet stitch into both loops of the chain after that.


If you need help making half double crochets and double crochets, please see the ""Tips"" section.

, Both of these double crochets should be worked into the same stitch. That stitch should be the next one along the chain.

, To complete the rest of the side, you will need to repeat the same pattern of double crochets, half double crochets, and single crochets.


Do not repeat the two double crochets made in the previous step.
In the next stitch, work one double crochet.
Work one half double crochet into the stitch after that.
Work one single crochet into each of the last two stitches of the foundation chain, completing the side.

, Work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook.

, You will need to make the exact same series stitches along the opposite side of your foundation chain to complete the second side. When making these stitches, you should work the hook under the single loops that still remain free along the bottom edge of the foundation chain.


Work one single crochet into each of the first two stitches.
Work one half double crochet into the next stitch, and one double crochet into the stitch that after that.
Work two double crochets into the following stitch.
Make one double crochet into the next stitch, followed by one half double crochet in the stitch after that.
Finish the second side by making one single crochet into each of the last two chains.

, Slip stitch once into the beginning of the foundation chain. Doing so closes the end of the leaf.


See the ""Tips"" section if you need help with the slip stitch.

, Work one slip stitch into the first stitch along your first side.


Insert the hook through both loops of the stitch as you work. You will need to do so to complete this initial slip stitch and all of the stitches that follow.
This step starts the process of forming one ""prickle"" along the side of the leaf.

, Single crochet once into the second stitch of the side, then work two chain stitches from the hook.


The last chain should be somewhat loose. If you make it too tight, the prickles along the edge of the leaf will bend and bunch up.

, Slip stitch into the second chain from the hook, then single crochet once into the same stitch.


Insert the hook into the second chain and yarn over. Pull the yarn through the stitch, then through the chain on your hook. This process can be a challenging one, so take your time.
This step completes the point of the first prickle and finishes the first prickle as a whole.

, The rest of the prickles are made using the same basic steps used to create the first.


Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches.
Make your second prickle in the stitch after that. Single crochet into that stitch, chain two, then slip stitch once into the second chain from the hook and single crochet once into the same chain.
Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches, then repeat another prickle using the same technique.
Slip stitch once into each of the next two stitches, bringing your hook to the chain-one you made previously at the tip of the leaf. Use the same technique to make a prickle into that chain-one stitch.
Work your way down the opposite side, creating three more prickles in the same exact way you created the prickles for your first side.
Slip stitch into the last stitch at the base of the leaf to round off the bottom of the leaf.

, Make four chain stitches off the base of the leaf. Slip stitch once into the second chain from the hook, then once more into each of the next two stitches.

, Insert your hook into the base of the leaf, near the middle. Yarn over, then pull a loop through to the front of the leaf. Pull this loop through the chain on your hook, as well.


Insert your hook further up through the middle and repeat the stitch once more.
Continue working your way up through the middle of the leaf in this manner until you reach the tip of the leaf. You should end up making about eight or nine of these stitches.
Make sure that your stitches remain somewhat loose so that the leaf can still lie flat.
You're working a center chain through the middle of the leaf during this step. This chain will give the appearance of a center vein.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull the tail from the back of the leaf to the front and through the loop on your hook to tie it off.


Use a yarn needle to weave the excess tail along the center back of the leaf, securing it in place.
The completion of this step also completes your leaf.

After this, you will create the ""keyhole"" where the scarf slips into itself creating the symbolic, Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon shape. The more rows you add, the longer the ""tails"" of your ribbon will be.


Your scarf should be at least 29 inches (74 centimeters) long, starting from the tip., Place a stitch marker into the middle of your row. You can eyeball it, or be more precise by counting the stitches. Next, do 1 single crochet into each stitch. When you reach the stitch marker, do 1 chain stitch, and turn your work.If you don't own a stitch marker, use a safety pin or a piece of yarn in a contrasting color.

, This is very important; you will be sliding the other end of your scarf through this keyhole to create a loop.


In short: do 1 single crochet in each stitch, followed by 1 chain stitch, then turn your work.

, Slip your hook through the first stitch to the side of the stitch marker. Measure out a 6-inch (15-centimeter) tail from your skein, then loop it over your hook. Use your hook to pull it through the stitch.At this point, you can pull out your stitch marker.

, Make a single crochet into each stitch, then a chain stitch, then turn your work. Do this for 8 more rows. You should end up on the outer edge of your scarf., Do a single crochet all the way across your scarf. When you reach the center of the keyhole, hole the 6-inch (cc-centimeter) tail from before along the top of your work. Crochet right over it, encasing it between both rows. When you reach the other side of your scarf, do 1 chain stitch, then turn your work., Set aside your work for a moment, and go back to the bottom of your keyhole. Thread the 6-inch (15-centimeter) tail onto a yarn needle, then weave it back into your work.

, Keep doing a single crochet into each stitch, then a chain stitch, then turn your work. Stop when your scarf is a few inches/centimeters too short. You will need to do the other slanted end of the ribbon.Make sure that your hook is on the same edge as the top of your slant, where you did your last repeat of row 2. This ensures that the scarf keeps classical, Breast Cancer Awareness ribbon shape., Single crochet the first 2 stitches together, then do a single crochet into each stitch for the remainder of the row. Finish up with a chain stitch, then turn your work.To join 2 stitches together with a single crochet:Push the hook into the first stitch, and drape the yarn over it (yarn over).
Pull the yarn through the first stitch, so that you have 2 loops on your hook.
Push the hook through the second stitch, and drape the yarn over it again (yarn over).
Pull the hook through the second stitch. You should now have 3 loops on your hook.
Drape the yarn over your hook once more, and pull it through all 3 loops on your hook.

, Do 1 single crochet into each stitch, except for the last 2. Single crochet the last 2 stitches together as before. Do 1 chain stitch, then turn your work., The end of your scarf should be almost the same length as the beginning of your scarf., Do a single crochet into the first 2 stitches, then do 1 single crochet into each stitch for the remainder of the row.

Tie all three yarn colors together.,
Work one chain with all three colors.,
Chain to desired length.,
Slip stitch the ends together.,
Fasten off the yarn.,
Wear the necklace.",How to Crochet a Necklace1," Unwind the ends of three separate yarn skeins. Lay the ends together, then tightly tie them into a single overhand knot.

Tie the knot within 2 inches (5 cm) of the yarn ends. Keep the knot tight to prevent it from coming undone.
Use three different colors. Consider choosing a metallic or glitter-accented yarn for one or two of the colors to make the piece more visually interesting.
You can technically make this necklace with only one strand of yarn in one color, but using three colors will make the necklace sturdier and more aesthetically complex.;
, Attach all three strands of yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work one chain stitch from all three strands.

For this pattern, you'll need to treat all three strands of yarn as though they were one strand instead of working with them separately.
Work your knots and stitches like you normally would, but hold the yarn strands taut so that you can stitch simultaneously and at even intervals.

, Continue working simultaneous chain stitches from all three strands of yarn until the resulting chain is long enough to wrap around your neck several times.

Keep the strands taut. You may need to occasionally straighten them out to prevent them from twisting together as you make the chain.
The exact number of chain stitches will vary depending on how many wrap-arounds you'd prefer and how snug you want the necklace to be.

For a short necklace that wraps around your neck four times, you'll need approximately 90 chains.
For a long necklace that wraps around your neck six times, you'll need approximately 270 chains.
Scale the necklace accordingly to create another size falling within this range. You can check the length by periodically wrapping the chain around your neck as you create it.



, Once you reach the desired length, slip stitch the last chain together with the first, creating a large loop., Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Using a yarn needle, weave the excess yarn ends into the stitches to prevent them from unraveling.

, The necklace should be finished and ready to show off. Slip the chain over your head, then wrap it around your neck several times and arrange as desired."

Chain two and single crochet into middle of heart.",How to Crochet a Heart Stitch," The heart stitch is pretty easy to do. However, you will need to have some special items before you get started. You will need:Two colors of yarn. You will need a yarn for the hearts and a yarn for the background. You can use any colors you like, just make sure that the hearts will be visible against the backdrop of the other yarn.
Crochet hook. Make sure the hook size is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using.
Scissors;
, To start the foundation row, you need to make a chain first. You can make the chain as long or as short as you want, but the chain needs to be a multiple of six plus one additional chain. For example, you could make a chain of 12 plus one for a total of 13 chain stiches, or you could make a chain of 60 plus one for a total of 61 stitches.To make the first chain, yarn over your hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook once and pull through to continue the chain.Make sure that you use the background yarn color to make this chain and to create your foundation row.

, For the first row, start by making a chain of three and then double crochet into the plus one stitch of your original chain. The chain of three is just used as a turning chain to provide slack.To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then push the hook through the hook and loop the yarn over again. Pull through the first stitch, and then yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches, then yarn over again. Pull through the remaining two stitches to complete your first double crochet., For the next row, start by making a chain of one for the turning chain. Then, single crochet to the end of the row.To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch and loop the yarn over. Pull this yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete a single crochet stitch., The foundation row (except for the starting chain) will need to be repeated after you finish each of the heart rows. This will provide some space between your hearts and help them to stand out more., After you finish the foundation row, you will need to switch over to your other yarn color to create the hearts. Cut your background yarn a few inches away from the hook while keeping the loop on the hook. Then, tie the heart yarn color to the end of the background yarn as close to the hook as you can.You will need to repeat this process every time you switch from one yarn color to another.
To work in the end of the yarn, you and lay it across the area where you will be crocheting next and just crochet around it to anchor it to the stitches. Or, if you prefer, you can also cut the end near the knot. Just make sure that the knot is very secure if you decide to cut the end.

, Your first stitch will form a half of a heart because it will be on the end of the fabric. Do three double crochet stitches into the first stitch. All three stitches should be in the same stitch., Next, you will need to chain three stitches to provide some slack. Then, skip the next five stitches in the row. This area will be empty for now, but you will fill it in in the next row., Double crochet three times into the sixth stitch from the beginning of the row. Work all three double crochet stitches into the same stitch. This will make the first half of your first full heart., To create the second half of the heart, chain two and then double crochet three more times into the same space as the previous three double crochet stitches.When you are done, you will have a total of six stitches in the same space and the shape will start to resemble a heart. However, don’t worry if it does not look exactly like a heart yet because you have another row to finish the heart.

, Keep working following the same pattern of chaining three, skipping five, and double crocheting into the same stitch to make more hearts in your row. When you get to the end of the row, double crochet three times into the last stitch as you did with the first stitch. This will create half of a heart., To fill in the gap left in between your hearts and continue the work, you will need to switch back over to the background yarn color. Tie it to the end of the heart yarn close to the hook like you did with the first changeover., Start the new row by single crocheting into the top of the first double crochet stitch in your row. This is the half-heart that you created., Chain two to provide some slack to move down to the base of your first heart. You will be crocheting into the foundation row to fill in the gaps between your hearts. Do a single crochet into the first stitch of the five stitches in between the hearts. Continue to single crochet into all five stitches.You will need to pull the final loop of each single crochet stitch up so that it extends to the top of the hearts.
Make sure to crochet around the chain of three that extends between each of the hearts as well so that these will be hidden.

, Next, chain two stitches and then single crochet into the middle of the heart. This will help to create the characteristic dip in the center of the heart shape.Follow this single crochet stitch with another chain of two and then continue to work in the same pattern as you did for the first space between hearts. Continue to the end of the row to fill in all of the gaps.

Wear the necklace.",How to Crochet a Necklace2," Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of 74 chain stitches.

This chain should fit comfortably around the base of your neck. You can subtract chains or add more as needed to adjust the length if 74 chains won't work, but make sure that the final stitch count is a multiple of four, plus two stitches.

, Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each of the remaining chains until you reach the end of the row.

Your total stitch count should decrease by one at the end of this row.
Do not turn the work when you reach the end of the row. You'll need to work back and forth across the entire piece instead of flipping it over after each row.

, Chain one, then single crochet into each stitch of the previous row.

Follow this pattern for rows two, three, and four. Your total stitch count should remain the same for each of these rows.

, Chain four, then work three treble crochets into the first stitch of the previous row.

You'll need to create three separate pieces for this necklace: the bow body, the bow center, and the choker. This step starts the bow body.

, Work one half-double crochet into the third chain from the hook, then work one half-double crochet into each of the remaining stitches across the row. Turn the work over once you reach the end.

For rows two through six:

Chain two.
Work one half-double crochet into each stitch across the previous row.
Turn the work over upon reaching the end of the row.



, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.

Using a yarn needle, weave the excess tails into the stitches to both hide and secure them.
This step completes the bow body.

, Attach new yarn to the size G (4.25 mm) crochet hook using a slip knot. Work a foundation of 8 chain stitches.

This step begins the bow middle.
Work with the same color yarn used to complete the bow body.

, Work one half-double crochet into the third chain from the hook, then work one half-double crochet into each chain across the rest of the row., Cut the yarn, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave the excess start tail into the stitches of the piece but allow the end tail to hang free.
This completes the bow center.

, Tightly wrap the bow center piece around the middle of the bow body piece, causing that middle to pinch together and create the bow shape.

Thread the yarn needle with the excess tail hanging from the bow center piece. Use this yarn to whip stitch the ends of the center piece together at the back of the bow body. Weave in the remaining excess when finished.
This step completes the overall bow.

, Attach new yarn to the size I (5.5 mm) crochet hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of 54 chain stitches.

Vary this stitch count as needed. The final chain should be long enough to sit comfortably around your neck.
This step begins the choker portion of the necklace. You can work the choker with the same yarn used for the bow or choose a different color.

, Work one double crochet into the third chain from the hook, then work one double crochet into each chain across the row., Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave the excess tails into the stitches of the choker.
This step completes the choker portion of the pattern.

, Thread an ordinary sewing needle with ordinary thread, then stitch the bow onto one end of the choker.

Position the center of the bow so that it sits on the fifth double crochet from one end of the choker. Sew the bow center onto this stitch.

, Sew a plain button onto the front of the choker at the end lying opposite the bow.

Place the button on the second or third double crochet of that end, depending on how tight you wish to make the necklace.

, The necklace should be finished and ready to wear. Wrap it around your neck, then slip the button in between two double crochet on the opposite end of the choker to secure it.

If properly placed, the button should remain hidden beneath the bow.
You can wear the necklace with the bow at the front of your neck for a traditional ""bow tie"" appearance, or you can turn the necklace so that the bow sits angled to one side for something more feminine.

Choose your yarn and needle size.,
Get a plain lampshade.,
Crochet a chain and join it in a circle.,
Build the chain into a long circular piece.,
Increase as needed.,
Slip the cover over your lampshade.",How to Crochet a Lamp Shade Cover1," You can create a crocheted lampshade using any kind of yarn or needle size you want. You can use a lightweight yarn with a small hook, or use a heavyweight chunky yarn with a large needle. It is up to you!


Consider the texture of the yarn as well. Some yarn types are fluffy, while others are silky and smooth. You can also find yarn that has embellishments woven in, such as metallic fibers.;
, To create a cover for a lampshade, you will need to get a plain lampshade to cover with a crocheted piece. This will give your crocheted material structure. You can use any color of lampshade that you like, just choose something with a smooth surface so that the crocheted material will lay over it smoothly.


Try a plain white lampshade, or opt for a colorful lampshade to coordinate with the yarn you will be using.

, You will need to create a chain that is long enough to go around the top of your lampshade.Measure the circumference of the top of your lampshade to determine how long it needs to be.


After you get the chain to the length you want it to be, connect it to form a circle. Then, double check to make sure that this chain will fit snugly, yet easily, over the outside of the lampshade.

, Begin crocheting in the round to create your lampshade.Keep going until the crocheted piece is long enough to cover the entire lampshade.

, If the lampshade you are using gets larger towards the bottom, then you will need to increase your piece to ensure a good fit. However, if your lampshade is a straight tube that does not get larger towards the bottom, then you do not need to increase.Test the crocheted piece on your lampshade periodically to determine how much you need to increase. Adding one stitch per round or every other round may be enough to accommodate a larger circumference towards the bottom of the lampshade.

, After you have finished the lampshade cover, tie off the end of the yarn and cut the tail. The, all you have to do is slip the cover over your lampshade. It should fit snugly, but it should not be so tight that it affects the shape of the lampshade. Then, just place the lampshade back onto your lamp and enjoy!

Gather your materials.,
Dip the doilies in a glue and water mixture.,
Place the doilies over the balloon.,
Wait for the doilies to dry.",How to Crochet a Lamp Shade Cover2," Making a crocheted doily lampshade is easy, even though the finished project will look like a work of art. The process you will use is called paper mache, which is when you dip paper into glue and layer it over a form such as a balloon. The only difference is that you will be using crocheted doilies instead of paper to create your lampshade. Before you can get started, you will need to:Create or gather your doilies. You will need several doilies to create a large paper mache lampshade, or just a few doilies to create a small paper mache lampshade. If you already have some, then you can just use these. If not, then crochet some doilies to use for your paper mache lampshade.
Protect your surfaces and clothes. Paper mache can be messy. Make sure that you place some newspaper or plastic down over the area where you will be creating your paper mache lampshade. You may also want to put on an old t-shirt or apron to protect your clothes.
Blow up a balloon. Next, you will need to blow up a balloon to the desired size of your lampshade. You can inflate the balloon fully if you want a large lampshade, or just inflate it partway for a small or medium sized lampshade. Tie off the balloon after you have inflated it. You can also tie a piece of string to the balloon and to suspend it in the air while you work on it. For example, you could tie the string to a ceiling fan (turned off, of course) or tie it your shower rod.

, Pour ¾ of a cup of plain white glue into a bowl and add ¼ cup of water.Stir the mixture until the glue and water are well combined. Then, begin dipping your doilies into the glue and water mixture one at a time.


Make sure that you have enough glue to dip the doilies into. You may need to use a couple of containers if you are trying to make more than one lampshade or a large lampshade.
Saturate each doily completely with the glue and water mixture.

, Begin layering the doilies over the balloon one at a time immediately after you have coated them in glue.The doilies should overlap slightly on the edges so that they will bind together and form the lampshade. Arrange the doilies on the balloon in whatever way is most pleasing to you.


Make sure to leave an opening for the lightbulb to fit through the lampshade if you are going to create a hanging lamp. You can use the tied-off end on the balloon as a guide for this opening. However, you may also want to measure the light fixture that you are using to ensure a good fit.
Another option is to place the doily lampshade over the top of a lamp in place of a normal lampshade. If you decide to do this, check the top of the lampshade to determine the size of the opening on the top of your lampshade.
You can even cover the entire balloon except for a small opening on the top.This will result in a round lampshade that you can use with a light fixture and hang from the ceiling. If you go this route, then make sure the opening is large enough to fit the lightbulb into. You will need to criss-cross a few pieces of string over the top of your doily lampshade to secure the light fixture piece in place.

, Leave your doilies on the balloon overnight so that they can dry completely. Place the balloon somewhere that will be protected from pets and children. After the doilies have dried completely, you can deflate the balloon by sticking a pin in the end.Gently pull the balloon away from the doilies.
After the doilies are dry and your balloon is deflated, your lampshade is ready to use!

Use multiple colors.,
Try a unique crochet pattern.,
Experiment with different shapes.",How to Crochet a Lamp Shade Cover3," You can stick with just one color to create your crocheted lampshade, or you can use a variety of colors for something bright and whimsical.Think about what colors you want to use before you get started.


If you have lots of yarn scraps, then you could use these to create your crocheted lampshade.
If you want to use a single color of yarn, make sure that you have enough for your project.

, You can use a simple crochet pattern to create your lampshade, or you can try something more advanced. Some stitch types you can use to create and embellish your lampshade include:Single Crochet
Granny Squares
Flowers

, If you are creating a simple lampshade cover, then you will need to create a tube of crocheted material to cover your lampshade. However, you could also create several rectangles, squares, or triangles and then stitch them together using an embroidery needle.If you are creating a paper mache crocheted lampshade, then you can be even more daring with shapes. You can use a combination of squares, triangles, and circles to create your lampshade.

Chain enough stitches to wrap around your head.,
Secure the ends of the chain with a slipstitch.,
Crochet until the headband is the width you want it to be.,
Finish the headband.",How to Crochet a Headband1," Start by making a chain. Chain enough stitches so that the chain will wrap around your head where you would wear a headband. It should feel snug, but not too tight.


To make a chain, you first need to make a slipknot. To do this, loop the yarn around your index and middle finger twice and then pull the first loop over the second loop. Slide the new loop onto the hook and tighten it by tugging on the tail.The number of stitches you need to chain will depend on your hook size and yarn type. For example, if you are using a bulky yarn with a size J hook, then you would need to chain about 44 stitches.;
, Insert your hook into the first stitch in your chain and loop the yarn over the hook. Then, pull the yarn through to secure the slipstitch.

Be careful not to twist your stitches as you connect the ends. Make sure they are straight before doing the slipstitch., Crochet around the circumference of the headband. You can use any stitch you like to crochet your headband, but you might want to do your first one using the single crochet stitch. To single crochet, insert the hook into the stitch, then loop the yarn over and pull through the stitch. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull through both stitches.You can use a single, double, or other crochet stitch depending on your intentions for the headband. If you want the headband to be something you can wear in the winter to keep your ears warm, then a tight stitch like single crochet might be best. However, if you want the headband to have some gaps and look a little fancier, then you could use the shell stitch or box stitch.
When you insert the hook to make your stitches, insert it under both the front and back loops of each stitch. This will help to ensure that your headband lays flat.

, To complete your crochet project, you will need to cut the yarn, fasten the end, and weave in the tail. Use the crochet hook to widen your last loop by at least a few inches and then cut it in the center. Pull the unattached free end of the yarn out of the loop, and then tug on the tail to tighten the knot. Then, use a darning or wide eyed tapestry needle to weave the tail into the edges of the headband."

Chain your foundation stitches.,
Skip a stitch and single crochet.,
Turn and chain one.,
Keep crocheting.,
Attach the ends or use something to fasten them.",How to Crochet a Headband2," Start by making a slipknot and then make a chain of six or more stitches for your foundation.Six stitches might work well if you are using a bulky or super bulky yarn. If you are using a medium worsted weight yarn, then 10 stitches might be a good width. Experiment to find the ideal width for your headband., Skip over the first stitch next to your hook and single crochet into the second stitch. Single crochet to the end of the chain. This will complete your first row. You can work your rows in a stitch other than single crochet if desired. Single crochet is a good practice stitch if this is your first headband. Some other stitches you can try include:

Popcorn stitch
Shell stitch
Box stitch

, When you reach the end of your first row, you will need to turn your work over to work the second row. Chain one stitch. This will be your turning chain. A turning chain provides some slack to prevent the stitches from bunching up or puckering., You will need to keep crocheting your rows in the stitch of your choice until the headband is long enough to fit snugly around your head.Check now and then when the headband starts to get close to this length.

Cut the free end of the yarn and tie it to secure it when you are finished. You can leave the tail a few inches long and then weave in the end, or trim off the excess.

, When your headband is the length that you want it to be, you can attach the ends or fasten them. You can either use a darning needle and some extra yarn to sew the ends together or you can hold them together with a safety pin or broach.

Another option is to leave a longer tail and use this to attach the ends. Thread the yarn through a darning needle or large eye tapestry needle and sew the ends together. Then, tie the end to the seam to secure it and trim off the excess.

You can use ribbon to accent one part of your headband or thread ribbon through the entire headband. Choose a ribbon that complements your yarn color and attach or thread it through the headband where you want it.


You can even use the ribbon to hide your seam if you created a strip headband and sewed the ends together. Loop the ribbon around the seam a few times and tie it in a knot or bow.

, Adding a decorative button is a cute way to embellish a headband. You can even use a button to attach the ends of a headband if you have used a stitch with some gaps in it.Sew the button onto the headband with a needle and thread., Choose a yarn or silk flower color that complements your headband and attach it with a needle and thread or just use a safety pin to secure it temporarily.

, If you want to give your headband a bow-like appearance without actually adding a bow, then you can use a chain of stitches to create this effect.Make a chain of about 10 to 15 stitches.
Then, loop the chain around one part of the headband a few times. Make sure to wrap the chain around the headband tightly.

Determine the size of your hat.,
Choose your yarn.,
Pick your crochet hook.",How to Crochet a Hat for Beginners1," Before you can begin crocheting your hat, you need to determine how large or small to make it. There are two options: you can use general guidelines to choose your size, or take a head measurement for a more specific fit. Either will work well enough, but you probably won’t be able to get an exact measurement for a hat that’s being gifted. The circumference (forehead to back of the head) and the height (ear to top of head) must be measured, but here are the average sizes:









Preemie: circumference = 12-inches, height = 4.25-inches
Newborn: circumference = 14-inches, height = 5-inches
Baby (6-months +): circumference = 16-inches, height = 6-inches
Child and youth: circumference = 20-inches, height = 7.25-inches
Adult: circumference = 22-inches, height = 8.5-inches
Large adult: circumference = 24-inches, height = 9.25-inches;
, To create a basic beanie, you can use any type of yarn. However, it is generally easier for beginners to choose a style that has a good amount of elasticity, isn’t too fluffy, and isn’t too thick. Aim for a 4-ply knitting worsted yarn made out of acrylic or wool.









The color doesn’t matter, but it is harder to see and count stitches with a darker color, so you may consider using a lighter hue for your first hat.

, The size of your crochet hook depends on the size of your yarn. For a 4-ply knitting worsted yarn (recommended), you will need to use an H

The pencil hold (hook help like you’re going to write something with it).

Tie your slipknot.,
Create your foundation chain.,
Make a slip stitch to join your end to the first chain you made.,
Mark your starting point.",How to Crochet a Hat for Beginners2," The slipknot is the start to your crochet pattern – the knot that holds the yarn to your needle as you work. To tie the knot:








Drape the yarn with the tail end in the palm of your hand, wrapped around the top of your index finger and under your middle finger.
Wrap the yarn back over the top of your index, behind the first loop.
Pull a loop from the center of the piece of yarn, and tuck this through the center of the large loop you’ve made around your fingers.
Place the new small loop on the crochet hook, and pull the tail of the yarn to tighten it.

, The foundation chain is simply the first row of chain stitches you create. Because you’re crocheting a hat, the foundation chain will not be very long – only five stitches to start.









To crochet your first stitch, hold the tail end of your slipknot and slide the hook forward, so that there is plenty of space on the end. Wrap the yarn around the end of the hook once, and then pull the hook backwards through the original slipknot. You’ve completed your first stitch! Repeat this five times to create your foundation chain., This will finish your foundation row, by hooking it back in a loop. Stick the end of your hook through the center of the first stitch, and do a single stitch (as per usual).







, As you crochet, you’ll need to keep count of your stitches. To do so, you’ll need to know where your row started.There are two general methods for marking the starting point: tie a piece of string around the first stitch in the second row, or slide a bobby pin over the stitch. When you get back to this part of each row, you will know you’ve completed an entire row of stitches.

"
Crochet in the round.,
Crochet your second row using a double stitch.,
Alter the pattern.,
Count your stitches.,
Continue with single stitches after the seventh row.",How to Crochet a Hat for Beginners3," To build your base chain into a hat, you will need to crochet in the round. Crochet in the round means to crochet a small circle – the base for your hat (the part at the very top). When you pull the hook through, you’ll have started a second row that is adjacent to the first, in a spiral.








As you crochet your hat, make sure that you continue to crochet in a spiral. Do not change the direction at any point.

, From now on, you’ll have to use a double stitch for your hat. This will attach all your new rows of stitches to the spiral in the center, so that you don’t end up with multiple loose rows.









To do a double stitch, you start with your hook with a single loop on it.
Slip the hook through the loop and into the chain under/next to it (attached to the spiral). You now have two loops on your crochet hook.
Finish by doing a regular stitch; wrap the yarn around the hook, pull this yarn through the two loops on your hook. You’ll always end with a single loop on your hook when you complete one double stitch., Once you’ve made the base round, you’ll change your stitch pattern just a bit to increase the body of your hat. For every row of stitches, you’ll start with a double stitch, do a single stitch, double stitch, single stitch, et cetera until you complete the row.







, The first few rows are easy, but as you move on you’ll need to begin counting your stitches.A double stitch counts for 2 stitches, and a single stitch counts for 1. For example, if you were doing a row of five, it would be 1 double stitch, 1 single stitch, one double stitch - finished. Here is how your counting should go:









First row: 5 stitches
Second row: 10 stitches
Third row: 30 stitches
Fourth row: 45 stitches
Fifth row: 60 stitches
Sixth row: 75 stitches
Seventh row: 90 stitches

, To complete your hat, you’ll do additional rows of single stitches. This will add length to the hat, rather than continuing to make it wider and wider. Start your rows of single stitches when you reach the desired circumference. To finish your hat completely, you’ll need to tie a slipknot and hide the tail end of the yarn by weaving it back into the hat with your hook.









To hide the end piece of your hat, you can weave it into the hat. Leave about 6” of yarn after you tie the slipknot and then use an embroidery needle to weave the end through the edge and into the inside of the hat. Then, tie off the end after you have woven it a few inches into the inside of the hat."

, Double crochet or half double is probably your best choice, because single crochet is stiff and treble crochet is too long and will get caught on knobs and other things, making the wearing of the dress more of a hassle than it needs to be.

, If you want to make it fitted, you'll need to increase and decrease some to make it work. This will take some experimentation, just keep working at it until you find something that works.

, If you want a curved neckline, you'll need to adapt the way you were working. This dress will be much easier without sleeves, but if you want sleeves, you can make them by just working rounds until they reach a good size.

Cut up some lace or fabric.",How to Crochet a Dreamcatcher," Making a crocheted dreamcatcher is an easy craft, but you will need some special materials to do it. Before you get started, you will need:An embroidery hoop in the size of your choice. 10 centimeters is a good size for a small dreamcatcher.
Size G/6 (4mm) crochet hook
A medium worsted weight yarn in the color of your choice
Beads, feathers, scrap fabric, lace, ribbon, or anything else you want to hang from the bottom of the dream catcher.
String and needle for hanging beads and feathers.;
, To cover the embroidery hoop, you will need to single crochet around the hoop. Start by making a slipstitch and slipping it onto your hook. Then, insert the yarn through the center of the hoop, loop the yarn around the end of your hook on the outside of the hoop, and pull this yarn through the loop on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through again.Continue to single crochet around the hoop until you have covered the whole thing in yarn. Keep the stitches close together by sliding them over as you go.

, To make a loop for hanging the dreamcatcher, chain 60 stitches. Then, connect the chain back into the hoop at the chain’s base with a slipstitch.To slipstitch, simply insert the hook in through the stitch and the loop the yarn over. Then, pull this new yarn through both loops on the hook.After the hoop is covered and the hanging loop is connected, you can cut the yarn and tie off the end. Set the hoop aside for now and begin working on the doily for the dreamcatcher’s web.

, To start the web, you will need to make a chain and connect it into a ring. Chain four stitches, and then connect the ends with a slipstitch., For the first round, start by chaining three stitches and then double crochet 11 stitches around the ring.To finish the round, slipstitch into the third chain.


The chain of three will count as one stitch so this round will have a total of 12 stitches.

, For the next round, you will need to chain five to start the round. This will count as your first double crochet. Then, follow with a double crochet and chain of two.Continue to double crochet and chain two all the way around.Finish the round with a slipstitch into the third chain in the beginning chain of five.

, As you continue to work around the circle, you will want to make the loops larger. To do this, start your next row with a chain of five and skip a stitch and slipstitch into the next one. Continue to chain five, skip, and slipstitch all the way around the round.You will need to do a few rounds to get the doily large enough to connect with the hoop. With each new round, increase the number of stitches you chain by one. For example, chain six for the next round and seven for the round after. This will help to create larger spaces in the web as you move outwards.

, Continue to chain and slipstitch around the circle until the doily is almost the same size as the hoop. To connect the doily to the hoop, start another chain round but wrap each chain around the hoop before you connect it back into the circle with a slipstitch. Do this for the whole round until the doily is fully connected to the hoop.

, You can string some beads and hand these from the bottom of your dream catcher to add color and interest. Thread a needle and tie a knot at the bottom. Then, string some beads onto the thread and tie the thread to the bottom of the dreamcatcher., Feathers are often added to dream catchers as a decorative touch. Thread a needle and insert the needle through the ends of the feathers. Then, tie the thread to the bottom of the dream catcher.Another option is to cut out feather shapes from felt fabric and attach these to the dream catcher with thread.

, An easy way to embellish your dreamcatcher is to cut some lace or fabric into strips and then tie them to the bottom of the dreamcatcher.Use some fabric and lace in colors that match or complement your yarn.


You can also tie strips of ribbon to the bottom of the dreamcatcher.

Top your cupcakes with some stitching or a bead.",How to Crochet a Cupcake Stitch," You can make your cupcake in any colors you like, but to make them seem more realistic, try using cupcake-like colors. You will need a color for your base, a color for your cupcake bottom, a color for the rim of your cupcakes, and a color for the cupcake frosting. Some good options include:Grey for the base. It will work well as a background color that won’t distract from your cupcakes.
Tan, beige, or brown for the cupcake bottoms. Cupcakes usually come in chocolate or vanilla varieties, so choose a color that reminds you of a cupcake you have eaten.
Pastel pink, dark pink, or light purple for the dividing rim. This will help to differentiate your cupcake bottom and frosting and add a pop of color.
White, cream, or tan for the frosting. Choose a color that is similar to frosting.;
, Start by making a slipknot with your base yarn.To make a slipknot, make a loop in the yarn and then make a smaller loop and insert that through your first loop. Pull the tail to tighten the larger loop and secure the slipknot. Then, slide the loop onto your crochet hook., You will need to make a foundation chain to begin your cupcake stitch. The foundation chain has to be a multiple of six plus three. For example, you could make a chain of 12 and then add three for a total of 15 stitches, or you could make a chain of 60 and then add three for a total of 63.To make the first chain, loop your yarn over your hook twice and then pull the first loop through your slipknot. Then, loop the yarn over your hook again. Pull it through the other loop on your hook. Continue until you have the desired number of chain stitches., Your first row will be all single crochet stitches. Single crochet one time into every chain in the row.To single crochet, insert the crochet hook into the stitch and then yarn over. Pull the yarn through the first stitch on the hook to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops to complete one single crochet stitch., You will need to switch over to the color you have chosen for your cupcake bottoms now. Cut your working yarn a few inches from the hook. Then, tie the end of the new yarn to your working yarn as close to the hook as possible., After you have switch your yarn over, turn your work around and then chain four stitches to begin the next row. This chain will serve as your turning chain and your first double crochet stitch., Next, skip the first two stitches in the row and then double crochet two times into one stitch. This will begin your first cupcake bottom.To double crochet, loop your yarn over the hook, and then push the hook into the stitch and loop your yarn over the hook again. Next, pull the yarn through the first stitch on the hook, and then loop your yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches on the hook, and then loop the yarn over the hook again. Pull the yarn through the remaining two stitches on your hook to complete one double crochet stitch., Repeat the double crochet stitch in the next stitch in your row, but only double crochet once into this next stitch. Then, double crochet twice into the stitch after that. This will complete your first cupcake bottom., To work over to the next space to make your next cupcake bottom, chain one and then skip the next three stitches.Repeat the cupcake bottom sequence of double crocheting twice, then once, and then twice again in the next stitch after the ones you skip.
Finish the row with one double crochet stitch in the last stitch.

, Your cupcake tops will have two colors. First, you will need to switch over to your pink or purple color. Cut the yarn a few inches from the hook and then tie the new yarn to the old yarn as close to the hook as possible., Begin your cupcake tops by single crocheting across the row, but only single crochet into the front loops rather than going through both loops.Also, when you reach a gap from the previous row, crochet around the chain rather than into the front loop only.

, To start your next row, you will need to change colors again. Do this the same as before and then chain six to start the new row. Turn your work around as well so you can start the new row., Bring the end of the chain to the beginning of your first cupcake and start working in the cluster stitch. The cluster stitch is similar to the double crochet stitch, but you will be continuing it across the top of your cupcake and then pulling all of the stitches together to give the look of a frosted cupcake.To do the cluster stitch, yarn over your hook and insert the hook into the first stitch. Then, yarn over again and pull through the first two loops.
Next, yarn over again and insert through the next stitch. Yarn over again and pull through two loops.
Continue to yarn over, insert through the stitch, yarn over, and pull through two to the end of the cupcake top. When you get to the end, yarn over and pull through all of the loops on the hook. Then, finish your cluster with one chain stitch., To work over to the next cupcake space, chain five and bring the chain over to the edge of the next cupcake top. Then, do another cluster stitch., When you are near the end of the row and have no more cupcake tops to work on, chain three and then bring the chain down to the end of the row. Double crochet into the last stitch in the row one time.

, To complete your cupcakes, you will need to switch colors one more time. Do this the same as before and then single crochet across the row., After you complete the single crochet row, chain three and then double crochet across the next row. This will create a foundation if you want to continue making cupcakes, or it will provide a border if your project is finished., If you want to add an extra decorative touch to your cupcakes, try using some red yarn or a red bead to top your cupcakes. This will resemble a cherry and provide an extra pop of color.To use yarn, thread a darning needle with red yarn and stitch in and out of the area at the tops of your cupcakes until you have a small red circle.
To add a bead, thread a needle and sew the bead into place at the top of your frosting mounds.

Slide this loop onto your hook and then make a chain of four stitches.Use a slipstitch to join the first and last stitches in the chain and make a circle. To slipstitch, insert the hook into the first stitch in the chain with the last stitch you made still on the hook. Then, yarn over and pull through both loops.;
, Chain one stitch to start the petal and then do four triple crochet stitches into the center of the chain circle to form the first petal. Repeat the triple crochet stitch three more times for a total of four stitches.To triple crochet, loop the yarn around the hook twice. Then, insert the hook into the center of the circle and loop the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the center of the circle, and the yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first two stitches on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the next two stitches on the hook. Finally, yarn over again and pull through the remaining stitches on the hook to complete a triple crochet stitch., To return to the center and give the petal a slightly curved shape, insert the hook into the center of the circle, yarn over and then pull through the first loop. Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook to complete the single crochet stitch.To single crochet, insert your hook into the center of the circle and yarn over. Pull this yarn through the loop on the hook to form a new loop. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull it through both of the loops., Start the next petal by chaining one and then make four triple crochet stitches and single crochet into the center. Keep repeating this sequence until you have made a total of five petals.After you do the last single crochet stitch into the center, you can cut the yarn a few inches from the last stitch and pull through to secure it. Tie it into a second knot and preserve the tail to weave in later.

, The easiest way to create a wide variety of crocheted flowers is to use different colors of yarn. Choose three or more colors to use for the flowers in your flower garland.


For example, you could use three different shades of pink, or three totally different colors, such as red, yellow, and blue.

, If you want to add some variety in the types of flowers in your garland, you can also try making some more advanced flowers. Some of the more advanced flowers you can try include:


Pansies
Roses
Cone shaped flowers

, Adding roses to your crocheted flower garland can also add some variety. Try using some green yarn to create small simple leaves to crochet next to and in between your flowers., Make a chain that is 24 or more links long to accommodate all of your flowers. You can space out the flowers as much or as little as you like. Make sure that the chain will be long enough for the amount of flowers you have made.


Count your flowers and decide how much space you want to go in between each of them to decide how long your chain should be. For example, if you have 10 flowers and you want to have five spaces between each of them, then make a chain of 55. This will allow you to place one flower every five stitches and still have five stitches on the end.
Try using green yarn to give the chain a vine-like effect., Begin to single crochet along your garland until you reach the first spot where you want to connect a flower. Then, insert the hook through the chain first and then through the part of the flower you want to connect to the garland, such as through the edge of one of the petals. Loop the yarn over, and then pull it through the flower and the chain to secure it.


Continue to single crochet along the garland until you reach the next spot where you want to attach a flower.
If desired, you may single crochet through two stitches in the petal to ensure that it is secure or that the flower will hang a certain way., When you have connected all of your flowers and reached the end of the garland, you can cut the yarn and secure it with a knot. Pull the last loop out and then cut it in the center. This will leave a tail that you can tie into the stitch to keep it secure.

Done!",How to Crochet a Circle," With your left palm facing you and your fingers to the right, lay the yarn in your hand, with the end above your index finger. Then, lift your index finger and place the yarn behind the finger. Wrap it around your finger twice, going forward from this back position. Holding the string in place with your thumb and other fingers, grab the string on the left and pull it up and over the other strand, grab that second strand (with the other still pulled to the right), and then pull that strand up and over the end of your index finger. You should then have a loop that you can adjust. Slide your hook in and adjust it until it's taut.;
, Chain stitch until you have four stitches. Then, place your hook through the first chain stitch (next to the slip knot), catch the working yarn on the other side, and then pull that yarn through the chain stitch and the loop on the hook.


If your pattern calls for a different number of starting stitches or different number of stitches around the circle, follow your pattern. All of the following stitch counts can and should be adjusted for your individual project.
You can make the next several steps easier by identifying the center hole. Slightly pull apart the two sides of the bunch until a hole appears in the center. Make sure it is the center hole and not the stitches from joining the two ends. Stick and keep a finger in this hole through the process to make your life much easier.

, Depending on if you are single or double crocheting, you will need to make different numbers of chain stitches here. This wikiHow will use double crochet for the rest of the example, so chain three (which is the equivalent of a double crochet).


Remember any time that you make one of these chains stitch sets, it counts as one double crochet (or whichever stitch you're using) in the pattern. Do not forget to count it!

, Wrap the yarn over your hook (called a yarn over) and then insert your hook into the center hole. Grab the yarn on the other side and pull it through the hole. You should now see three loops on your hook. Catch the yarn again and pull it through the first two loops, and then catch the yarn again and pull it through the last two. Do this eight more times, until you have ten stitches in total around the center hole (counting the initial chain three as one stitch).


Remember this and all double crochet stitches as ""3, 2, 1"" in order to get the loops right.

, Find your chain three that you made in the beginning. Find the third chain, insert your hook into the stitch, yarn over, and pull the yarn through the stitch and then also through the loop on your hook.

, You are likely following a pattern and at this point you should follow the specifications of the pattern. In general (if you are not following a pattern), you will chain three again and stitch double crochets into the outside of the circle, usually adding a single chain every three stitches or so. The second and following rows will be different depending on what final shape you're going for and what your pattern is.

, Point your left pointer and middle fingers together toward your right hand. Catch the working side of the yarn in your left ring and pinky fingers. Wrap the yarn end under and behind the top two fingers, and then around to the front, until it is looped twice around the pointer and middle fingers.

, Place your left hand face up and insert the hook into the hollow between the two fingers. Go under the first loop, grab the second loop, then flip the hook over until it is lying flat against the top of your hand. Twist the hook around until the hook returns to the original position. The yarn around your fingers will now act as the center loop.

, Stretch out your pinkie and ring fingers to expose the working yarn. Yarn over and pull through the loop on your hook. Chain three (for double crochet) and then switch your hold: use your thumb and middle finger on your right hand to pinch the joint between the chains and the loop, and slide your fingers out of the loop (you can reinsert your ring finger to keep the loop taut if it helps you). Double crochet into the large loop as normal and make eight more double crochets in a line along the big loop (creating a total of ten again).


Do not let go of the tail on the loop. This is very important. You should keep holding the tail in place with your finger, or secure it with tape.

, Holding the end of your stitch line in your right hand, pull the tail with your left hand to form the circle. You can pull it to whatever tightness suits you.

, Find your chain three that you made in the beginning. Find the third chain, insert your hook into the stitch, yarn over, and pull the yarn through the stitch and then also through the loop on your hook.

, You are likely following a pattern and at this point you should follow the specifications of the pattern. In general (if you are not following a pattern), you will chain three again and stitch double crochets into the outside of the circle, usually adding a single chain every three stitches or so. The second and following rows will be different depending on what final shape you're going for and what your pattern is.

, Chain stitch until you have a long single chain. Chain stitches are done by placing the yarn over the hook from the back, grabbing the yarn with the hook, and pulling the yarn through a loop in the yarn.

, Wrap the chain into a spiral until you have a circle shape. Make your chain longer if the circle it makes is not the size you want. Then, measure the distance from the center of the circle to the outside.

, Unroll your spiral and tie four-eight extra strings onto the starting point of the chain. These strings should be about 50% longer than the distance you measured from the center to the edge of the spiral.

, Re-roll the spiral and then weave the extra strings through the centers of the stitch in each row, bringing the string from the center to the edge. Do this for all of the strings and space them evenly.

, Tie the ends off at the edge of the circle.

, Tie off the end of the chain or continue your project as you want.

, The more extra strings you have, the more secure the circle will be. This is not the most attractive of crocheted circles, but it is the easiest if you have trouble counting stitches and getting your circle to sit flat.

, For the second row, start by turning your work and making a turning chain of three stitches. This will provide some slack to start the next row and help to prevent puckering., Skip the first three stitches in the row and then double crochet one time into the fourth stitch. Skipping the first three stitches will allow you to double back and double crochet into one of the stitches you skipped. This is what creates the criss crossing effect of the cabbage patch stitch., After the double crochet stitch, make a chain of two stitches and then double crochet into the first stitch in the row that you skipped. This will required you to double back and cross over your first double crochet stitch.Continue to skip three stitches, double crochet, and then double back and double crochet into the first stitch you skipped.
When you reach the end of the row, double crochet into the last stitch to finish the row.

, To start the third row, you will need to turn your work and then make a chain of three stitches. This will be your turning chain to provide slack for the row., In the last row you made chains of two that you used to provide slack and double back to the stitches you skipped. For this row, you will be double crocheting four times into each of these chain of two spaces.Continue to double crochet four times into each of the chain of two spaces all the way to the end of the row.
Double crochet one time into the last stitch in the row to finish the row.

, You will need to repeat these three rows to continue working in the cabbage patch stitch. After you complete your third row, turn your work around, chain three, and start the rows over again.Begin your next row by skipping four and double crocheting into the same stitch four times and follow the same pattern from there.
When you finish your project, cut the yarn a few inches from the last stitch and then pull the end through the last stitch to secure it. Tie it in a second knot through the last stitch ensure that it will not unravel.

Try using a bulky yarn with a size K hook, and then chain 67 to start.Keep in mind that the number of stitches you will need to chain will depend on the gauge of your yarn. To check the gauge, crochet a square that is 4” by 4” and then count the number of stitches required to create this length going in each direction.;
, You can make a capelet in just about any stitch. However, if you want to give your capelet a holey design, you can use the V-stitch.To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook and then insert the hook into the stitch. Yarn over again, then pull through the first loop on your hook. Yarn over again and pull the yarn through the first two loops on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull the yarn through the last two loops.Be sure to double crochet into the same stitch twice.

, For the rest of the row, you will be skipping one and then double crocheting into the same stitch twice. Skip your next stitch and double crochet two times into the next stitch.


Continue this pattern all the way to the end of your row.

, After your last set of two double crochet stitches, chain three and turn your work over. This will be your turning chain and it will provide some slack as you begin your next row., Instead of double crocheting into the stitches for the second row, you will be double crocheting into the spaces that you created with your first row of V-stitches. Yarn over as usual for a double crochet stitch and then insert your hook into the second space and loop the yarn over on the other side. Pull through your first stitch, then yarn over again and pull through first two stitches. Then yarn over again and pull through last two stitches.Do another double crochet into the same space.
Continue to double crochet into every other space twice to the end of the row.

, When you reach the end of your row, do not double crochet into the space twice. Instead, finish by double crocheting into the top of the chain you created in the previous row. This will complete your second row., For your third row, you will need to work two V-stitches into each space. This will begin to increase your work and give your capelet a flowing look. Start by chaining three stitches as you did for the previous row. Then, skip a space and double crochet twice into the next space to create your first V-stitch. Then, chain one and double crochet into the same space twice again.Repeat the double V-stitch for every other space to the end of the row.
Finish the row with one double crochet stitch into the top of the chain from the previous row.

, To continue working on your capelet, you will need to repeat the second row and third rows. Keep working in this way until the capelet is as long as you want it to be.Don’t forget to chain three at the beginning of each new row.
Work the V-stitches and double V-stitches into every other space, not into the stitches.
Finish each row with one double crochet stitch into the top of the chain.
Tie off the yarn when you complete your final stitch.

, For easy way to finish your capelet, you can thread a double strand of yarn through the top of the shorter side of your capelet (first row). This will provide a simple way for you to wear the cape. Just tie the yarn in a bow whenever you want to wear it.


Another option is to thread a piece of ribbon through the top of your capelet. You can use ribbon in a complementary color.

, You can use any type of yarn you like to make a capelet, but a textured bulky yarn is an easy way to ensure that your capelet has a textured look and feel. Try using a type of yarn that is bumpy and soft.

, If you prefer to use a smooth texture yarn, then you also have the option of working your capelet in a textured stitch. Some good textured stitch options include:


Textured Shell Stitch
Popcorn Stitch
Crunch Stitch
Criss Cross then Stitch

, Instead of securing your capelet with a piece of yarn or ribbon, you can also sew a large button onto the corner of the top of the cape. You do not need to make a button loop because a large enough button should fit through one of your spaces. Use a needle and thread to sew on the button and then slip it through the space that best secures the capelet.

Determine the finished size you want.,
Select your yarn.,
Choose a hook size.,
Choose a stitch.",How to Crochet a Blanket1," The size of your blanket will depend on the purpose and the recipient. Here are some common blanket sizes, listed in inches and centimeters:


Infant receiving blanket: 36x36 inches (90x90 cm)
Child's afghan: 36x42 inches (90x105 cm)
Teenager's afghan: 48x60 inches (120x150 cm)
Adult's afghan: 50x70 inches (125x175 cm)
Lap blanket: 36x48 inches (90x120 cm);
, The size and thickness of your blanket, as well as your crocheting skill, can help you choose a type of yarn. If you're just beginning to crochet, choose a yarn with a smooth texture, a light color (so you can see your stitches clearly) and worsted (medium) weight.


Count on needing 3-4 skeins of yarn for a lap blanket or a receiving blanket. Double that estimation for a larger blanket.
If you are at all unsure about whether you have enough yarn for the project at hand, get an extra skein or two.
If you're buying yarn that's produced in a dye lot, make sure each skein has the same dye lot number on the label. Otherwise, your skeins might be slightly different colors.

, Crochet hooks range in size from B (2.25mm) to S (19mm). Here's what to keep in mind when you're selecting a hook:


The bigger the hook, the bigger the stitch. Bigger stitches are easier to see, and they mean you'll get through the blanket faster. However, you'll also use up more yarn.
Bigger stitches are also looser, and make for more lightweight blankets. If you want a particularly warm blanket, choose a smaller hook for tighter stitches.
If you're just starting to crochet, choose a hook that's size N or bigger. You can work your way up to smaller hooks as you get more comfortable with crocheting.

, Your stitch will determine the look and composition of your blanket. There's an endless array of stitches to choose from, and you can even improvise on basic stitches to create your own. This article will outline a few easy patterns you can start with.

Chain stitch the width of the afghan.,
Turn around and start on the second row.,
Keep crocheting each row until you have the length you want.,
Finished.

",How to Crochet a Blanket2," Keep the chain loose so you have plenty of room to crochet inside the stitches later. Hint: Make the number of stitches in your chain divisible by 5 or 10. It makes it easier to keep track of whether you're inadvertently increasing or decreasing each round. Know how many ""extra"" chains you'll need. Depending on the type of stitch you plan to use, you'll have a certain number of stitches that become part of the ""turn"" when you move on to the second row. For a single crochet, it's one chain; for a double crochet, it's three.








, Once you're done chaining, turn your work so that you'll be moving from right to left along the top of the chain. For a single crochet, insert the hook into the second loop from the needle. For a double crochet, insert the hook into the third loop from the needle.








, You can count your stitches as you go, or you can periodically stop and count up the stitches on the row you just finished. Dress it up (optional). Crocheting only into the far side of each loop (instead of through both loops) gives a nice ridged appearance to the finished crochet.

You can keep your granny square all one color, or alternate the colors in each section. You could even make a design like a maze or a heart, although that takes more planning. Go one step further and do opposite color combinations for different squares.








, Slip stitch the squares together in rows, then slip stitch the rows together. Crochet a border around the blanket (optional). If you wish, you can add a border around the connected squares to give the blanket a more finished look.

Turn the stitches and chain two stitches.,
Slipstitch into the first stitch and then HDC.",How to Crochet a Crunch Stitch1," Start by crocheting a simple chain of 12 stitches. This will be the foundation for your practice piece.You can use any size needle with an appropriate weight yarn to practice the crunch stitch.


If you have a project in mind that you would like to try, then you can use the pattern’s suggestions or your own calculations for how many to chain.;
, To begin working the crunch stitch, start by counting to third stitch from the hook (stitch on the hook counts as one) and then slipstitch into this stitch.To slipstitch, simply insert the hook through the third stitch and then loop the free end of your yarn around the hook and pull this new yarn through both stitches that are on the hook., Follow the slipstitch with a half-double crochet stitch.The half-double crochet stitch is a bit more complex than a slipstitch, but it is easy after you do it a few times.


To do an HDC stitch, loop the yarn over the hook, then insert the hook through the next stitch. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through the first loop. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull the hook through all three stitches that are on the hook., After the HDC stitch, follow with a slipstitch. Continue to alternate between slipstitch and HDC to the end of the row., After you reach the end of the row, turn the stitches and chain two new stitches with the hook. These will be your turning stitches and you will do this at the beginning of each row., Start this new row with a slipstitch into the first stitch and then follow with a half-double crochet stitch. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and half-double crochet stitch to the end of the row.Keep working in the crunch stitch until you feel like you have gotten enough practice or until you have achieved the desired length.
Remember to turn your work and chain two at the beginning of each row.

",How to Crochet a Crunch Stitch2," You can use crunch stitch to make all sorts of things, but the crunch stitch is great for making washcloths because of the bumpy texture. Making a crunch stitch washcloth is easy and you only need a few items to do it. You will need:Cotton yarn in the color of your choice
Size H crochet hook
Scissors

, Make a chain of 26 stitches to start your crunch stitch washcloth.You will be working this chain in the crunch stitch.


This chain size will make an approximately 8 inch square washcloth. If you want your washcloth to be larger or smaller, adjust the number of stitches according to your yarn gauge.

, Start by doing a slipstitch into the second chain from the hook.After the slipstitch, use a double crochet stitch on the next stitch.Repeat this pattern to end of row. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and half-double crochet stitches until the end of the first row., When your reach the end of the row, turn the stitches around and chain two stitches.This will be your turning chain for your second row. You will need to make a turning chain for every even row until you complete the washcloth.

, After you chain two new stitches, slipstitch into the first stitch in the row and then follow with a half-double crochet. Continue to alternate between the slipstitch and HDC to the end of the row., For the third row and all odd rows after this one, start with a slipstitch. Do not chain two at the start of this row. Just slipstitch and then follow with a half-double crochet.Turn when you reach the end of the row and then repeat the pattern that you used for row two.

The first yarn color will be labeled as A and the second will be labeled as B.
Fine, light, and worsted weight yarns work especially well for this pattern, but you can experiment with different types of yarn to produce different effects
If using a fine yarn, use an E (3.5 mm) hook. For light yarns, use a G (4.0 mm) hook. For worsted weight yarns, use an I or J (5.5 or 6.0 mm) hook.;
, Tie yarn A to your crochet hook using a standard slipknot.


To make a slip knot:

Create a loop by crossing the attached end of the yarn over the loose end.
Pull the attached side through the loop, creating a second loop in the process.
Tighten the first loop around the second.
Insert the hook into the second loop, then tighten the second loop onto the hook.



, Work a foundation row of 34 chain stitches.


To make a chain stitch:

Yarn over the hook.
Pull the yarn-over through the loop already on your hook.



, Work one double crochet into the third chain currently from the hook.


When counting chains, do not include the loop currently on your hook.
To work a double crochet stitch:

Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook into the stitch.
Yarn over the hook. Pull this yarn-over and the hook back to the front, drawing up a loop in the process.
Yarn over the hook. Draw this yarn-over through the first two loops already on your hook.
Yarn over the hook again. Draw this yarn-over through the final two loops on your hook.



, You will need to double crochet into the next 13 chains, but the number of double crochets will vary in each one.


Double crochet once into each of the next six chains.
Double crochet three times into the chain after that.
Double crochet once into each of the next six chains, as well.

, Double crochet once into all of the next three chains.To double crochet decrease over three stitches:

Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook into the back loop of the first of the three stitches.
Yarn over the hook again. Pull the loop through to the front of the stitch.
Yarn over and pull the yarn-over through the first two loops on the hook.
Repeat the process in the back loop of the second stitch. Yarn over and insert the hook into the second of the three stitches, then yarn over and pull the loop to the front. Yarn over once more and pull it through the first two loops on your hook.
Repeat the process in the back loop of the third stitch. Yarn over the hook and insert it into the last of the three stitches, then yarn over and pull the loop through to the front of the stitch. Yarn over again and pull it through the first two loops on the hook.
Yarn over one last time, and pull it through the remaining four loops on your hook.



, Double crochet into the next 13 chains, varying the amount as follows.


Double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.
Double crochet three times into the chain that comes next.
Double crochet once into each of the six stitches that follow that.

, Double crochet once over both of the next two chains to make another double crochet decrease.


To double crochet decrease over two stitches:

Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook into the back loop of the first stitch.
Yarn over the hook again, then pull it through to the front of the stitch to form a loop.
Yarn over again and pull that yarn-over through the first two loops on your hook.
Repeat the procedure into the next stitch. Yarn over the hook and insert it into the back loop of the second stitch. Yarn over again and pull the loop to the front. Yarn over once more and pull it through the first two loops.
Yarn over one last time and pull it through the remaining three loops on your hook.



, Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.


These chain stitches act as a ""turning chain."" In other words, they set the row height for your next row.
After completing this turning chain, the first row is finished. Turn the work before continuing to the next row.

, Skip the two chain stitches and the first double crochet of the previous row. Then, double crochet once into each of the next seven stitches.


Work each double crochet into the back loops only.

, You will need to double crochet into the back loops of the next seven stitches, but the amount will vary for each stitch.


Double crochet three times into the back loop of the next stitch.
Double crochet once into the back loops of each of the following six stitches.

, Work a double crochet decrease over the next three stitches.

, You will need to double crochet into the back loops of each of the next 13 stitches, but the number of double crochets made into each stitch will vary.


Double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.
Double crochet three times into the stitch that follows.
Double crochet once into each of the following six stitches, too.

, Work a double crochet decrease over the next and final two stitches in the row.


This completes the second row. Turn the work, but do not create a turning chain for the next row yet.

, Switch to your second yarn color before beginning the third row.Loosely loop yarn B around the tip of the hook, just above the loop already on your hook. Leave a 4-inch (10-cm) tail of yarn B.
Pull the yarn B yarn-over through the yarn A loop on your hook. A should be removed from the hook, leaving a loop of B in its place.
Cut yarn A, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail to weave in later.

, Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.


This creates a turning chain and sets the height for your next row.

, Follow the same set of instructions used to complete the second row for each remaining row of the scarf.


For each row:

Skip the first double crochet stitch.
Double crochet once into each of the next seven stitches.
Double crochet three times into the stitch that follows.
Double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.
Decrease over three stitches.
Double crochet once into the following six stitches.
Double crochet three times into the stitch after that.
Double crochet once into each of the following six stitches.
Decrease over two stitches.


At the end of each row, chain two to create a turning chain for the next row, then turn the work over before beginning the next row.
Repeat as often as needed until the scarf reaches a length of 72 inches (183 cm) or your desired length.

, Change colors, alternating back and forth between A and B, following the same technique used to change colors the first time.


Always change colors before completing the turning chain. Do not change after creating the turning chain.
Make sure that your scarf ends with two rows of yarn B.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to bind off the end.


At this point, it's a good idea to weave this tail and all other tails into the back of the scarf.
If desired, you can leave the scarf in its current state and wear it as is. The decorative fringe is recommended, but not strictly necessary.

, Cut 60 pieces of yarn, each measuring 12 inches (30.5 cm) long.Of these 60 pieces, 30 should be from yarn A and 30 should be from yarn B.

, Divide the pieces of fringe into 20 groups, each consisting of three strands.


Each group should contain three strands of the same color. Do not mix colors within each group.

, Evenly arrange 10 groups along each edge. Tie each group onto an appropriate stitch along the corresponding edge.


Insert all three strands through the stitch. Center them over the stitch, then tie them into a standard knot over the outer edge of the stitch.
You have three options concerning the positioning of your fringe:

Arrange all A fringe on the A edge and all B fringe on the B edge.
Arrange all A fringe on the B edge and all B fringe on the A edge.
Switch back and forth between groups of A fringe and groups of B fringe on both edges.



, Use scissors to carefully trim the fringe so that the strands lie even with one another.


After you complete this step, the scarf is complete.

, Fold the scarf in half so that the two ends are brought together.


Do not allow the scarf to twist as you fold it.
The ""wrong"" side of the scarf should face outward.
Make sure that the peaks and valleys of each chevron stripe match evenly when placed together.

, Work a slip stitch into each set of stitches along the ends of the scarf. Continue from one side to the other.To slip stitch two stitches together:

Insert the hook into the opposite stitch.
Yarn over the hook once.
Pull the yarn-over through the loops on your hook.



, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to bind off the end.


Weave this tail and all other tails into the back of the scarf using a tapestry needle.
After completing this step, the scarf is finished.

This pattern calls for a size G (4.25 mm) crochet hook and lace weight (#0) or super fine weight (#1) yarn, but you can easily adapt it for use with different hooks and yarn. Keep in mind that larger hooks and heavier yarns will create chunkier bows.;
, Work 45 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create a foundation for the bow.


You can also vary the number of chains to create smaller or larger bows. The length of the foundation chain will be nearly six times as long as the final width of the bow.
A foundation chain of this size should create a bow measuring approximately 3 inches (7.6 cm) across.

, Single crochet once into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each chain across the foundation.


Your stitch count for this row should be one less than the stitch count of your foundation. If you started with 45 chains, you should complete 44 single crochets in this row.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring about 3 inches (7.6 cm). Pull this tail through the last loop on your hook to fasten off the yarn.


Use a yarn needle to weave the start and end tails into the completed stitches. Doing so should hides these ends while further securing the yarn.

, Loop the completed strip into the shape of a bow.


You can either tie a basic bow from the strip or loosely fold the strip into the basic bow shape without tying it. Either option should work.
Make sure that the loops and tails of the bow are even on both sides.

, Cut 6 inches (15 cm) of yarn. Slide the new yarn beneath the center of the bow shape, then tie a basic overhand knot over the center of the bow.

, Wrap the long end of the new yarn around the center of the bow several times. Once you're satisfied with the way it looks, tie a knot at the back of the bow using both ends of the new yarn.


You should wrap the center at least four or five times to secure it. If you prefer a chunkier center, though, you can make additional wrap-arounds after that.

, Work 25 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create a foundation for the rest of your stitches. Slip stitch the last chain to the first to create a round.


You can alter the size of the bow by changing the number of chains. The final length of the bow will be about half the length of your foundation chain.
Working 25 stitches with the pattern hook size and yarn weight should create a bow between 3 and 4 inches (7.6 and 10 cm) long.

, Chain two, then work one half double crochet into each chain across the foundation round. Slip stitch the last half double crochet to the top of the initial chain-two.


The number of half double crochets should match the number of chains in your foundation.

, Complete three more rounds following the same pattern used in the previous round.


Chain two, then half double crochet once into each of the stitches of the previous round. Slip stitch the final stitch to the top of the chain-two in each round.
Turn the work over in between rounds to keep the stitch pattern even.

, Cut the yarn, leaving roughly 3 inches (7.6 cm). Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.


Use a yarn needle to weave the start and end tails into the inner stitches of the work.
This step completes the body of the bow. You'll create the bow center separately.

, Attach new yarn to the crochet hook using a standard slip knot.


This step starts the bow center. The yarn and hook used for the center of the bow should match that used for the body of the bow.

, Work four chains from the loop on your hook, creating a foundation row.


The exact number of chains can vary depending on the size of the bow and your personal preference. This chain will determine the width of the center, so you can add fewer or more depending on how wide you want the center to be.

, Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then work one single crochet into each remaining chain across the foundation.


The number of single crochets made in this step should be one less than the number of stitches in your foundation. If you started with four chains, you should make three stitches in this step.

, Continue working rows of single crochet until you have a strip of material long enough to wrap around the center of the bow body.


For each row: chain one, single crochet once into the same stitch as the chain, and single crochet once into each stitch across the rest of the previous row.
Turn the work over in between rows.
The final strip should wrap tightly around the center of the bow body. It will need to be slightly larger than the width of the body.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 10 inches (25.4 cm) of excess. Pull the excess tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

, Fold the bow body to create one double-layered band. Cinch the center of that band, then wrap the smaller strip around that center.


Center the seam of the bow body along the back of the folded band. The short ends of the bow center should meet over this seam.

, Using the 10-inch (25.4-cm) tail and the yarn needle, whip stitch the stitches along the short ends of the bow center, fastening it together.


After finishing the seam, knot the yarn and weave it into the stitches.

Make a magic circle with two chains.,
Double crochet into the circle.,
Work a connecting chain.,
Repeat the pattern.,
Tighten the loop.,
Fasten off the yarn.,
Wrap the tail around the center.",How to Crochet a Bow3," Wrap the yarn around the crochet hook into the form of a magic circle. Work two chain stitches over the edge of the circle.


This pattern calls for a size B/1 (2.25 mm) hook and lace to super fine yarn, but you can experiment with different hooks and yarn weights to alter the size of the bow.

, Work six double crochet into the center of the magic circle.


These double crochet will form one side of the bow.

, Work three chain stitches, then slip stitch once into the center of the ring.


The connecting chain will help separate the two sides from one another, making them distinct and preventing them from running together.

, Create another bow side and another connecting chain following the same pattern used for the first set.


To complete the second side of the bow, chain two and work six double crochet into the center of the magic ring.
To complete the second connecting chain, chain three and slip stitch the last chain into the center of the magic ring.

, Carefully pull the ending tail of yarn, tightening the center of the magic ring in the process.


Note that you may need to hold the starting tail steady to cinch the center closed.
Continue tightening the center until the ring seems as tight as possible. Stop before the two sides of the bow can fold in on one another, though.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 6 inches (15 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the last loop on the hook to fasten it off.

, Wrap the remaining tail around the center of the bow several times to define the shape. When you're satisfied with how it looks, knot the tail at the back of the bow.


Weave the starting tail and the remaining end tail into the back side of the stitches using a yarn needle.

A crochet hook appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Be sure to check the label of your yarn for recommendations on what size hook to use with the yarn.
Scissors
Button
Needle and thread;
, You don’t need to worry about measuring your phone to get the right measurements for your cell phone case. All you need to do is to make a chain long enough to wrap around your cell phone width-wise.The chain should be snug, but not super tight. If the chain is too tight, add a chain or two. If it is too loose, take a couple of chains out.
Leave a long tail of about 10 to 12 inches (25 to 20 cm). You can use this yarn to sew the bottom closed after you finish making the case.

, Next, you will need to connect the beginning and end of the chain to begin crocheting in rounds. With the loop still on your hook from the last chain you crocheted, insert the crochet hook into the first link in your chain. Then, loop the yarn over the hook, and pull it through both stitches to secure them together.Your chain should now be connected in a circle.

, Once the chain is a circle, you can begin single crocheting around it.Start by inserting the hook into the first stitch in the round. Then, loop the yarn over and pull this yarn through the first loop. Loop the yarn over the hook again and then pull this yarn through both stitches on the hook. This will complete your first single crochet stitch.Single crochet to the last stitch in the round, and then slipstitch to connect the first and last stitches.
If you prefer to use a different type of stitch, then you can. For example, you could try the double crochet stitch, popcorn stitch, or cluster stitch.
Be careful not to twist the stitches.

, You will need to continue to single crochet all rounds until the case is long enough to hold your cell phone. Once it looks like you are getting close, try slipping your cell phone into the case to see how far you have to go. Keep going until your entire cell phone fits in the case., After you have achieved your desired length for the cell phone case, you will need to bind off your work. To do this, cut the free end of the yarn a few inches away from the hook, and then pull it out through your last loop to secure it.


To deal with the tail, you can either weave in the end using a darning needle, or tie it in a second knot and cut the excess., Use the tail that you left at the beginning of making the case to sew the bottom of the case closed. If you did not leave a long enough tail, then tie a 10 to 12 inch (25 to 30 cm) piece of yarn to the tail and thread it through a darning needle. Then, stitch along the bottom of the cell phone case to close it.

, To make a closure for your cell phone, case, the first thing you will need to do is to sew a button onto one side of the case. You can choose any type of button you like. However, keep in mind that a larger button may provide a more secure hold.Use a needle and thread to sew the button into place. Try to position it in the center top portion of the case.

, Next, tie a piece of yarn to one of the stitches in the back of the case. Then, begin making a chain. Crochet a chain that it long enough to extend to the front of the case, loop around the button, and then connect back to the same spot in the back of the case.Do this with the phone in the case. Having the phone in the case will give you a more accurate idea of how secure the button and chain closure will be.

, After the chain is the desired length, snip the free end and pull the end through the loop to secure the chain. Then tie this end to the back of the case near the beginning of the chain.Your cell phone case it now ready to use! You can keep it as is, or add a chain handle.

, To make it easier to carry your crocheted cell phone case, you may want to make a handle. However, keep in mind that this is optional. You can make a short length handle to carry your cell phone like a clutch, or you can add a long chain handle to carry your cell phone like a purse.

, Tie a piece of yarn to the case where you want one end of the handle to begin. Then, begin to crochet a chain. Make the chain as long as you want it to be.

, When your handle is the desired length, cut the free end a few inches away from the hook. Then, pull the end through your last loop to secure the end of the chain. Then, tie this end to the case where you want the other end to be. This will complete a simple chain handle.


If desired, you can single crochet along the chain one or more times to make a thicker handle.

Turn your work, and then single crochet back along your chain.,
Continue to crochet up to the height you want your bag to be.,
Fasten off your yarn.,
Fold and sew to make your bag.",How to Crochet a Bag Easily1," This bag is an excellent project for a beginner. If you haven't already reviewed our excellent wikiHow on Crochet, be sure to check it out (along with the helpful accompanying video instructions).


For this project, you only need to know how to do the chain stitch (usually abbreviated “ch”) and a single crochet (usually abbreviated “sc”).;
, This is a flexible pattern, and you can adapt it to make small envelope style clutches or even laptop or tablet sleeves.


If you're planning on carting a particular item in your new bag, measure it in advance (e.g., your laptop) or measure a similar style bag so that you have the basic dimensions and shape in mind.

, If this is one of your first crocheting projects, it will probably be best to stick with a simple, plain yarn of cotton or soft acrylic. You may also want to choose a solid color yarn so that you can see how the stitches are made and be able to count them more easily.

, Most yarn labels indicate what size hook you should use; it will be best if you stick with the recommended hook size.


As a general rule, the thicker the hook, the thicker the yarn will need to be.
If you want to complete your project faster, choose a thicker yarn and hook. The stitches will be larger, and you'll build up rows faster.

, As with any project, creating a test swatch is a good idea. You may be impatient to get started right away on your bag, but taking the time to make a small square (approximately 4""X4"") can save you time in the long-run.


Making a test swatch can help you gauge your tension (how loose or tight your stitches are) and figure out how many stitches will be in an inch.

, Because this is a beginner piece, you will be creating either a rectangle or a square (the top and bottom of your bag will be equal lengths, as will the sides).


More advanced projects will allow you to create different shapes, such as an isosceles trapezoid where the top tapers in. You'll need to learn how to decrease stitches to be able to make this shape of a bag.
For small to medium size bags, between 30 and 60 stitches should work well.
Be sure to remember how many stitches you included in this initial chain. You may want to write it down, and if your chain is particularly long, you may want to use markers every ten to twenty stitches to help you keep count.

, Once you've completed your initial chain that is as long as you want the width of your bag to be, you'll need to turn so that you can start the next row on the opposite side. You will need to do this every time you get to the end of a row.


To turn your work, simply rotate clockwise halfway so that your last stitch in the current row becomes the first stitch in the new row you are starting. , Now that you've got the hang of single crocheting and turning, just keep going until the bag is as tall as you want it to be.


You will be folding up the bottom part of the bag (the top will fold down as a flap). Keep this in mind as you crochet up. Don't make your piece too short.
If you want your bag to be 12"" high (when the flap is folded over) with a 6"" flap, you'll want to crochet your piece to be 30"" tall.

, Once your piece is as tall as you want it to be, you need to fasten off the yarn. Fastening off when crocheting is actually quite easy.


Simply cut off your yarn from the skein, leaving a tail of a few inches. Draw the tail of the yarn onto your hook, remove the hook and pull on the yarn to tighten it. Then, weave the tail through the stitches in your top row. .

, Fold up the bottom half of your bag to make the pouch.


Check to see if there is a “wrong” side of the piece; if you prefer the look of one side, make sure that is facing out as you fold up.
Using a matching yarn (most likely the same yarn you crocheted with, unless you like the look of a contrasting seam), sew the side seams together, stopping at the point at which you want the flap to fold over.

Review steps 1-5 from above.,
Decide if you will want your bag to have a flap.,
Create a chain.,
Turn your work, and then single crochet back along your chain.,
Continue to single crochet.,
Fasten off your yarn.,
Repeat Steps 3-6 for the second piece of your bag.,
Sew the front and back pieces together.,
Make a strap for your bag.",How to Crochet a Bag Easily2," Instead of the simple envelope bag, you may decide you want to try your hand at a tote bag. Because this method has you crochet two pieces and sew them together, your bag will be a bit roomier on the inside, and thus will be well-suited to use as a purse or shopping bag.


The beginning steps of this alternate project are the same as the envelope-style bag. You'll want to make sure that you are comfortable with the basic crochet stitches, have carefully selected your yarn and hook, and have thought about what you want your final project to look like. Once you've done that, you're ready to start crocheting your new bag!

, You will be creating two pieces and sewing them together. If you do not want a flap for your bag, the front and back pieces will be identical. If you want a flap, however, you'll need to crochet the back piece to be taller.


For example, if you want a bag that is 12"" tall with a flap, you'll want to make your back piece longer—crocheting to 18"" will give you a 6"" flap.

, Counting your stitches carefully, create a chain until you reach the length you'd like the bottom and top width of your bag to be. You will be crocheting either a square or a rectangle, depending upon the shape you want your tote to be.


If your chain is particularly long, you may find it helpful to use markers every ten or twenty stitches to help you keep count.

, Once you've completed your initial chain that is as long as you want the width of your bag to be, you'll need to turn so that you can start the next row on the opposite side. You will need to do this every time you get to the end of a row.


To turn your work, simply rotate clockwise halfway so that your last stitch in the current row becomes the first stitch in the new row you are starting. , Keep crocheting, turning, and creating new rows until you reach the desired height you are aiming for.


Remember that if you want a flap for back, the back piece will need to be longer (taller) than the front piece.

, Once your front (or back piece, depending on which you are working on) is as tall as you want it to be, you need to fasten off the yarn.


Once you've completed your last row, cut the yarn from the skein, making sure to leave a few inches. Draw the tail of the yarn onto your hook, remove the hook and pull on the yarn to tighten it. Then, weave the tail through the stitches in your top row. .

, Once you've finished, you'll have either two identical pieces (the front and the back of a bag with no flap), or two pieces with a longer back side piece that will flap over the front.

, With the wrong side of the two pieces facing each other, use matching yarn to sew the bottom and side pieces of your bag together.


You'll probably want to use the same color yarn to sew your pieces together, but it may be fun to use a contrasting color.

, You'll most likely want to add a strap to your bag. The process for making this is very similar to what you've already been doing.


Make a chain as long as you want your strap to be.
Turn the chain, and single crochet back along to the end of the chain.
Repeat the single crochet until the strap is as wide as you want it to be.
Finish off the strap, and then sew the ends of the strap into the corners of your bag.
Be sure to use plenty of stitches when attaching the straps to your bag; nothing is worse than having a strap break, causing you to the contents of your bag!

Note that the primary yarn (color A) will be used for the yoke, body, and sleeves of the sweater. The secondary yarn (color B) will only be used for the edging.;
, Work 32 chain stitches from the loop on your hook to create your foundation row. Turn your work once you reach the end.

You'll need 32 chain stitches to create a sweater sized for babies between 3 and 9 months old. For babies in 6 to 12 month clothing, create a bigger sweater by starting with 43 chain stitches.

, Work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then one single crochet into each of the remaining chains after that.

Once you reach the end of the row, chain two and turn the work.

, Work one half double crochet into each of the first two stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that.

Afterward, half double crochet once into each of the next three stitches and twice into the stitch the follows those. Repeat this pattern across the rest of the row.
Note that the stitch count will increase by the time you reach the end of this row, creating a slight curve.
Once you reach the end of the row, chain two and turn the work.

, Work one half double crochet into each stitch across the entire row.

Chain two at the end of the row, then turn the work over.

, Work one half double crochet into each of the first three stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that.

Afterward, half double crochet once in each of the next four stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Repeat this pattern across the row.
Chain two when you reach the end of the row and turn over the work.

, For the remaining yoke rows, switch back and forth between straight half double crochet rows and half double crochet increase rows. Create a total of 8 rows for sweaters sized 3 to 9 months, or 12 rows for sweaters sized 6 to 12 months.

For row five: Half double crochet once in each stitch. Chain two and turn at the end of the row.
For row six: Half double crochet once in each of the first four stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that. Half double crochet once in each of the next five stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that; repeat across the row. Chain two and turn at the end.
For row seven: Half double crochet once in each stitch. Chain two and turn at the end of the row.
For row eight: Half double crochet once in each of the first five stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that. Half double crochet once in each of the next six stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that; repeat across the row. Chain two and turn at the end.
For row nine: Half double crochet once in each stitch. Chain two and turn at the end of the row.

For row eleven: Half double crochet once in each stitch. Chain two and turn at the end of the row.
For row twelve: Half double crochet once in each of the first seven stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that. Half double crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then half double crochet twice in the stitch after that; repeat across the row. Chain two and turn at the end.

, The yoke should be done by this step, but you should not cut the yarn or fasten it off., Work a series of chain stitches and half double crochets across the last row of the yoke to form the armhole base row.

Half double crochet once into each of the first seven stitches, then half double crochet twice into the eighth stitch. Half double crochet once into each of the seven stitches after that.
Chain five (for 3 to 9 month size) or seven (for 6 to 12 month size), and skip 16 (for 3 to 9 month size) or 19 (for 6 to 12 month size).
Half double crochet once into each of the next eight stitches (3 to 9 month) or ten stitches (6 to 12 month). Half double crochet twice into the stitch after that. Repeat once, then half double crochet once into each of the next eight (3 to 9 month) or ten (6 to 12 month) stitches.
Chain five (3 to 9 month) or seven (6 to 12 month), and skip 16 (3 to 9 month) or 19 (6 to 12 month).
Half double crochet once into each of the next seven stitches, then half double crochet twice into the stitch after that.
Half double crochet once into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.
Turn your work at the end of the row.

, Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook. Skip two stitches, then work one v-stitch into the stitch after that.

Work v-stitches across the rest of the row, skipping two stitches in between each one. Continue until you reach the last two stitches.

To create a v-stitch: double crochet once, chain one, and double crochet once more into the same space.


Double crochet once into the last stitch.
Chain three at the end of the row, then turn the work.

, Double crochet once into the first stitch from the hook, then cluster stitch into the center of each v-stitch in the previous row.

More precisely, you must cluster stitch into the chain-one space of each v-stitch.
Double crochet once into the final stitch of the row.
Chain three at the end of the row, then turn over the work.

, Alternate back and forth between the first (v-stitch) and second (cluster stitch) body rows until the sweater reaches an appropriate length.

For 3 to 9 month sweaters, you'll need approximately eight body rows total. For 6 to 12 month sweaters, you'll need approximately 12 body rows total.

, When you reach the end of the final body row, cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the work.

Use a yarn needle to weave the remaining tail into the stitches along the underside of the garment. Doing so should hide the excess while further securing the end.

, Tie the yarn to your crochet hook, then attach the yarn to the center bottom of one armhole using a slip stitch., Work one slip stitch into each stitch around the armhole. You'll need 23 stitches for 3 to 9 month sizes, or 30 stitches for 6 to 12 month sizes.

Join the last slip stitch to the first with another slip stitch.

, Chain two, then work one half double crochet into each stitch across the previous round.

Slip stitch the last and first stitches together to create another round.
Do not turn the work at the end of the round.

, Continue working rounds of half double crochet to match the previous round. Repeat as needed until the sleeve reaches an adequate length.

For a long-sleeve 3 to 9 month size, you'll need approximately 10 rounds total. For a long-sleeve 6 to 12 month size, you'll need approximately 14 rounds total.

, Half double crochet once into the first stitch, skip two stitches, then half double crochet once into the stitch after that. Repeat across the round.

Slip stitch the last and first stitches together at the end of the round.
Decreasing the stitch count in this manner creates a cuff for the sleeve.

, Work one slip stitch into each stitch of the previous round.

This will be the final round of the sleeve.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave the excess tail into the stitches along the inside of the sleeve.

, Work a second sleeve onto the other armhole. Follow the same procedure used to create the first sleeve.

Note that both sleeves must be identical, so you need to use the same amount of stitches in each one. Pay close attention to your stitch count to maintain uniformity.

, Tie the secondary yarn to the crochet hook with a slip knot, then join the yarn to the bottom of the sweater with a slip stitch.

Join the yarn to either end of the bottom edge; do not join it to the center of this edge.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch across the entire row.

Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row.

, Work two double crochets into each stitch across the entire row.

Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end of the row.

, Chain four, then work one double crochet into the same stitch as your chain.

Afterward, chain two, then double crochet once into the next stitch. Repeat this pattern across the row.
Do not chain or turn the work once you reach the end.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to secure the end.

Weave the excess along the underside of the ruffled edge.

, Follow the same steps to create a ruffle on the open edge of both sleeves.

The pattern remains the same, but at the end of each row, you'll need to slip stitch the last and first stitches together.

, Cut six 5-inch (12.5-cm) lengths of 3/8-inch (9.5-mm) wide ribbon. Tie these pieces of ribbon to either edge of the yoke.

The ribbon should roughly match the color of the secondary yarn (color B).
Tie three pieces to the right side and three pieces to the left, positioning them as close to the garment edge as possible. Pair the pieces off into three sets of ribbon.

, Put the finished sweater on the baby. To close it, tie each of the three ribbon pairs into bows."

Make a magic ring.,
Chain two.,
Create two bullion stitches in the first stitch.,
Finish your flower.,
Choose a special yarn.,
Use a latch hook to change the tension.,
Loop the yarn around the hook a few more times.,
Work more bullion stitches into every stitch.",How to Crochet a Bullion Stitch Flower," Start by creating a magic ring to use as your base for the flower. To make a magic ring, loop the yarn around your index and middle fingers twice. Then, slide the double loop off your fingers and insert your hook into the center. Yarn over and then pull this loop back to the outside of the circle. Then, yarn over the hook again above the circle and pull this loop through the first loop. This will be your first stitch.Work five more stitches around the ring in the same fashion for a total of six stitches.
When you are finished, tug the tail of the yarn to close the ring and then slipstitch to connect the last stitch to the first stitch.;
, For the next round, start by chaining two stitches.These two stitches will mark the beginning of your next round. You will not need to do this again.

, To make your first bullion stitch, loop the yarn around your hook seven times. Then, insert the hook into the first stitch in the round and loop the yarn over your hook again. Pull this yarn through the first loop on your hook. Then, yarn over again and pull through the rest of the loops.Go slowly and just focus on working off one loop at a time.
Try to maintain consistent tension as you go.
When you finish your first bullion stitch, work another into the same space.
Continue to work two bullion stitches into every stitch in the ring.

, Once you complete the final bullion stitch for the round, you will need to connect this last stitch to the first one and then tie off your final stitch. Use a slipstitch to connect the first and last stitches.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over. Then pull the yarn through both loops.
To tie off and finish your work, snip the yarn leaving a tail that is long enough to tie in a knot. Pull the tail of the yarn through the loop to secure the final stitch into a knot. Then, tie the yarn through this stitch again to secure it. Snip the end close to the knot to finish your flower.

, The bullion stitch works well with many different types of yarn, but choosing a special color or textured yarn can alter your finished product. Try choosing a multicolor yarn for colorful flowers, or choose a fluffy yarn for soft touchable flowers.


Remember to check the yarn label for recommendations about what hook size will work best with your yarn.

, Using a latch hook instead of a crochet hook can help to ensure that your tension is even throughout the stitch. A latch hook can also make working this stitch a little easier.To use a latch hook, loop the yarn around the hook the same way that you would with a crochet hook and then pull through the first loop. Then, loop the yarn over the hook again and pull through the rest of the loops.
The latch will close and prevent the hook from getting caught on the loops as you pull through, so this should be one smooth movement.

, You can easily change the size of a bullion stitch by looping the yarn around the hook a few more times.For example, looping the yarn around 10 times will create a smaller bullion stitch than looping it around 15 times.


You can even try alternating between bullion stitch sizes. For example, you could start with bullion stitch that has seven loops and alternate with bullion stitches that have 14 loops. This will create a noticeable contrast in your flower petals.

, Adding one or more extra bullion stitches into every stitch in the round will also change the appearance of your flowers. The flowers will seem fuller and even a bit ruffled.Try doing three or four bullion stitches into each stitch in the round to change the look of your crocheted bullion flowers.

If this is your first time trying to crochet, it is best to stick with a simple, plain yarn made of cotton or soft acrylic yarn. Choose a solid color for the yarn so that as you're learning, you can see how the stitches are made--patterned yarn would make this more difficult.Soft acrylic yarn: This type of yarn is less expensive than other yarns, which makes it good for beginners who are just learning new patterns. Try to avoid the absolute cheapest yarn when you do begin making projects to give away, as many cheap yarns can be scratchy (and who wants a scratchy scarf?)
100% Cotton yarn: Cotton yarn is good for making things that you think will get washed a lot (such as dish towels.) Cotton yarn is absorbent and easy to wash.
Novelty yarn: This yarn is the most varied and generally the most expensive. Novelty yarn can be made of very soft, fine wool that results in deliciously soft sweaters and scarves. Keep in mind that this kind of yarn can’t be washed as often as cotton yarn.;
, These days, almost every yarn has label on it that will tell you which size hook to use. If you do not own any hooks and this is your first time crocheting, purchase the size hook that the yarn you would like to work with recommends. Hook sizes are measured in millimetres or fractions of an inch.









As a general rule, the thicker the hook, the thicker the yarn will need to be.


, While there is no right way to hold a crochet hook, there are two basic styles which can be reversed, depending on which is your dominant hand. Holding the hook incorrectly can lead to your hand cramping.








Using the Over-the-Hook position: Hold the hook so that the handle rests against your palm, like a pencil. Your hand should go over the hook with your thumb and index finger placed so that they are grasping the thumb rest (an indentation in the handle.)
Using the Under-the-Hook position: Hold the hook like you are holding a spatula. Your hand should be under the hook with your thumb and forefinger placed on the thumb rest.

, As you're learning, your tension may vary. Before you begin a pattern, make a test swatch. A test swatch is when you practice a specific stitch without trying to make anything--you are simply practicing how to do the stitch while also figuring out your preference on how tight or loose you would like your stitch to be.








, Every crochet project begins with a chain stitch, usually abbreviated as ch in instruction pamphlets. Practice crocheting a chain for about 10 to 15 minutes a day until you are able to hold the yarn so that it is not too loose or too tight.










Form a slip knot around the hook, and wrap the yarn around the hook. To make a slipknot, make a loop with your yarn so that the tail of the yarns hangs down behind the loop. Guide the hook through the loop under the tail and then back out of the loop. Pull the tail, which will tighten the yarn around the hook, making a slipknot.Use your thumb and middle finger of your left hand (if you’re right-handed) to hold the end of the slipknot. Use your left index finger to guide the yarn from the back to the front around the handle of the hook. Use the hook to pull the yarn through the loop on the hook--one chain link will form. Repeat this process to make a chain stitch.,









Make a chain stitch that is six chain links long. Slide the hook through the first chain link you made--doing this should form a ring. (The first chain link is the one furthest away from the hook, since you made it first.)With the hand you use to move the yarn (not your dominant hand) wrap the yarn around the hook from back to the front. At the same time, rotate the hook so that it’s throat (so the tip of the hook is facing you.)
Pull the yarn and hook back through the stitch and then through the loop on the hook. This completes one slip stitch.


, Draw a new loop through the chain stitch (but not through the loop that is already on the hook). You should now have two loops on the hook. Pull a new loop of yarn through both, remaining with a single loop. Repeat.









Single crochet is a relatively tight stitch and will result in a more closely stitched material. 


, Double crochet stitches are great for making sweaters and scarves because they are a bit looser than other stitches (so your sweaters will be more comfy.)









Make a chain with 15 chain links in it. Yarn over the hook from front to back. Slide your hook between the first two front loops and under the fourth chain link from the hook. Yarn over the hook again.
Pull the wrapped yarn through the chain stitch by gently guiding the wrapped hook through the chain. This should result in having three loops on your hook.
Pull your hook through the first two loops on the hook. Yarn over the hook again and then pull the hook through the last two loops on the hook. Your double crochet is complete. Repeat.

, Turning chains are helpful when you want to change direction with your stitch.

, Crocheting in the round allows you to create circular things like hats and coasters.

, Granny squares are what allowed your grandma to whip together a crocheted blanket in the blink of an eye.

, Have a lot of clothing and old blankets that are dear to you but pretty worn down? Preserve their memory by making them into a rug!

, Making a scrubber that can be used endlessly will lend your kitchen a bit of eco-friendliness that we should all strive for.

, Doilies add elegance to anything they get placed on, even the most scratched of tables. Add a touch of the refined to your home by crocheting doilies.

Decide on a size.,
Choose your yarn.,
Choose your hook.",How to Crochet a Baby Blanket1," Baby blankets come in different sizes. Before you begin, you'll need to decide what size blanket you're going to make. Here are some common sizes for infant and baby blankets. A smaller size makes a nice blanket to lay over a newborn; choose a larger size if you want your blanket to be used for a long time.



Receiving blanket - 36"" x 36""
Crib blanket - 36"" x 54""
Toddler blanket - 40"" x 60"";
, Yarns are made in different styles. If you are a beginner, it will be easiest to work with a smooth yarn. Yarn is also categorized by weight, or the thickness of the strand. A yarn's weight determines how big your stitches will be, how your finished item will look and feel, and what size hook you will need to use. It also determines how long it will take you to finish your project. You will find a yarn's weight printed on the package; they range from 0 - Lace to 6 - Super Bulky. Here are some recommended yarns to use for a baby blanket.


1- Super Fine or Fingering: good for light, lacy blankets

2 - Fine or Sport Weight: good for light yet cuddly blankets
3 - Light Worsted or DK (Double Knit): good for warmer, yet still light blankets
4 - Worsted Weight: slightly heavier, but very easy to work with

, Crochet hooks come in different sizes. In the U.S., sizes are denoted by letters. The higher the letter, the larger the hook - so, a K hook will be larger than an H hook. Generally speaking, the heavier yarn weight you choose, the larger hook you will need. Here are some suggested combinations for yarn and hook.


Super Fine - F hook
Sport Weight - G hook
Light Worsted/DK - H hook
Worsted Weight - H or I hook

Know the stitches.,
Make a starting chain.,
Learn to single crochet (sc).,
Learn to double crochet (dc).",How to Crochet a Baby Blanket2," There are dozens of different crochet stitches and techniques, but most of them are built on two basic stitches: the single crochet (sc) and double crochet (dc)

, A starting chain, also called a foundation chain, is literally the foundation of any crochet project. Every crochet pattern will tell you how many stitches you need in your starting chain. A chain is made with several chain stitches (ch). To make a starting chain, follow these steps.


Make a slip knot and loop it over the crochet hook. Leave at least a 6"" tail on the end of the knot.
Hold the crochet hook in your right hand and the yarn in your left.
Pass the yarn over the hook from back to front (this is called yarn over or yo)
Pull the hook and the wrapped strand of yarn through the original loop on the hook.
You have now made one chain, and should have one loop remaining on the hook.
Continue this until you have the number of chains you wish, or as specified by the pattern.

, Single crochet is the simplest stitch, and creates a tightly woven fabric. To make a single crochet stitch:


Begin with a starting chain. For practice, make a chain of 17.
Make sure the front of the chain is facing up. The front of the chain looks like a row of nesting ""V""s. The back of the chain looks like a row of bumps.
Insert the hook from front to back into the second chain from the hook.
Yarn over the hook.
Pull the hook and the wrapped strand of yarn through the stitch. You should now have two loops remaining on your hook.
Yarn over the hook again.
Pull the hook and the wrapped strand of yarn through both of the loops on your hook.
You should now have one loop remaining on your hook, and have made one single crochet.
Moving right to left, continue making single crochets until you reach the end of the chain. You have now made one row of single crochet.

, Double crochet is one of the most commonly used and versatile crochet stitches. It makes fabric that is solid, but more flexible and soft than fabric made with single crochet. To make a double crochet stitch:


Being with a starting chain. For practice, make a chain of 19.
Make sure the front of the chain is facing up. The front of the chain looks like a row of nesting ""V""s. The back of the chain looks like a row of bumps.
Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook from front to back into the fourth chain from the hook.
Pull the hook and the wrapped strand of yarn through the stitch. You should now have three loops on the hook.
Yarn over and draw the hook and wrapped strand of yarn through the first two loops. You should now have two loops on the hook.
Yarn over again, and draw the hook and wrapped strand of yarn through both loops.
You should now have one loop remaining on your hook, and have made one double crochet.
Moving right to left, continue making double crochets until you reach the end of the chain. You have now made one row of double crochet.

While you're working, stop every few stitches and check to make sure your foundation chain isn't twisted. Smooth it out as necessary, always leaving the row of ""V""s facing up.


To make a 36"" x 36"" blanket, chain 150
To make a 36"" x 54"" blanket, chain 150
To make a 40"" x 60"" blanket, chain 175

, Beginning with the second chain from your hook, work single crochet stitches all along the foundation chain. Try to keep your stitches as even as possible as you work.

, To proceed from the first row to the second row, you will need to make a turning chain. A turning chain is like a vertical bridge or connector between the rows. The length of your turning chain varies depending on the type of stitches you are using for your project.


When you get to the end of your first row, make one chain stitch (ch 1). This is your turning chain. The turning chain counts as the first stitch of your next row.

, With your turning chain in place, you can begin the second row.


Flip your work over so that the back side of the fabric is facing you, and your crochet hook is at the right. The last stitch of row 1 now becomes the first stitch of row 2.
Insert your hook into the first stitch of row 2, and work a single crochet stitch.
Continue all the way to the end of the row.

, The exact number of rows will depend on how tightly you crochet, but here are some guidelines:


For a 36"" x 36"" blanket, make 70 rows
For a 36"" x 54"" blanket, make 105 rows
For a 40"" x 60"" blanket, 110 rows

, It's a good idea to stop and check your work every so often. Count to make sure you are making the same number of stitches in each row. Check for mistakes. Measure your work with a measuring tape to see how close you are getting to your goal. If you notice a mistake, here's what you can do:


Slip your hook out of the yarn loop and pull gently on the end of the yarn. Your work should start to unravel.
Keep gently unraveling the yarn until you get to the point of your mistake. Unravel back to one stitch prior to your mistake.
Insert your hook into the loop for that stitch, and begin crocheting from that point.

, When your blanket is as long as you want it to be, work all the way to the end of your last row. Then, you can add a border, end off your yarn, and weave in the ends.


To make a simple border, flip your fabric over so the right side is facing you, then turn your the fabric 90̊. Ch 1 and insert your hook into the corner of your fabric. Make 3 sc into the corner. Sc all along the edge of your fabric until you reach the next corner, make 3 sc in the corner and continue around in this fashion until you reach your starting point. You can add another row of border in the same manner if you wish.
To end off, ch 1 and make a big loop with the yarn. Slip the hook out of the loop and cut your yarn, leaving a long tail. Pull the end of the yarn through the loop and tighten to make a knot.
To weave in the ends of the yarn, hold your fabric with the back side facing you. Thread the end of the yarn through a tapestry needle. Insert the needle through the bottom of several stitches (about two inches). Skip the last half of the last stitch, then weave the needle back through the same stitches for about an inch. Pull the yarn through, and clip the end of the yarn close to the fabric.

Buy yarn in the weight called for by the project instructions.,
Choose the type of fiber according to the instructions or your own preferences.,
Buy enough yarn for your project, plus a little extra.,
Check the lot numbers of the skeins.,Buying Crochet Hooks,
Buy hooks one at a time or as a set.",How to Buy Crochet Supplies1," Weight refers to the thickness of the yarn, the number of threads (plies) that make up the strand, the weight per meter, and the number of wraps per inch. Yarn weights have been standardized by the Craft Yarn Council.


0 (lace) is called laceweight in the United States.
1 (superfine) is also called fingering weight.
2 (fine) is also called sport weight.
3 (light) is also called DK weight, which stands for double knitting.
4 (medium) includes worsted weight and Aran weight, which is slightly bulkier.
5 (bulky)
6 (super bulky);
, Check the label to learn the care instructions and find out whether the yarn is washable or must be dry-cleaned.


Wool yarn includes lamb, Merino, virgin, Shetland and Icelandic varieties. It's a popular material for crocheters and other crafters. If possible, buy washable wool, which has been treated so it can be cleaned with water.
Fleece yarn includes mohair and cashmere from goats, and angora from rabbits.
Silk, cotton, linen and rayon yarns are smooth and shiny.
Synthetic yarns are made of nylon, acrylic and polyester. These are easy to use and care for.
Plant-based yarns can be made from soy, bamboo or corn.
Novelty yarns can be difficult to work with, especially for novice crocheters. They include ribbon, boucle (textured), chenille, thick-thin and faux fur.

, Most stores will buy back skeins you don't use. The project instructions will either tell you how much you need by weight or recommend a specific number of skeins of a certain brand.

, Buy the same lot number for all yarn of the same brand and color. You may not be able to tell the difference between lots in the store, but they will be very obviously different in the finished item.

,, If buying a set, make sure it includes a wallet to keep all the hooks together and organized by size.


Steel hooks are small and sized from 00 to 14. They are used for working with crochet thread and very small yarns. If you don't want to do small projects, skip buying these hooks. Many crocheters find working with small hooks and yarns causes hand cramps and eyestrain.
Aluminum or plastic hooks are sized D through S and are made for working with larger yarns. Aluminum hooks are more comfortable for most crocheters because of their weight. For hooks larger than K, consider plastic instead.
The method for sizing hooks can be different in different countries. Consult a conversion chart if the project instructions calls for hooks measured in millimeters or using numeric sizes.

Buy a bag or basket to hold your yarn and other supplies as well as the work in progress.,
Consider other supplies that make completing your project easier:


Small scissors
Yarn needles
Row counter to keep track of the number of rows you've worked.",How to Buy Crochet Supplies2," This not only makes it easy to keep your supplies in one place, but keeps your yarn in good shape, especially if you have cats or small children that like to play with yarn balls.


Choose a lightweight bag with handles if you want to carry your project around; otherwise, buy a basket with a lid that will look attractive sitting with your furniture.

,
Stitch gauge to make sure your item will be the correct size when finished.
Measuring tape
Magnifying light
Comfort pads for hooks if your fingers tend to get numb or tingly from holding the hooks.
Stitch markers and locks to keep track of where you've made specific stitches and to keep the stitches from unraveling between work sessions.
Yarn bobbins will hold small amounts of yarn or entire skeins. Small bobbins are useful for projects in which you change colors often because they keep the yarn ends from getting tangled. Large bobbins allow you to pull the yarn from the skein smoothly, but most crocheters don't bother with them.

This completes round 2., Start with 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet in the first stitch. Do 2 double crochet stitches in the second stitch. Next, do 1 double crochet stitch for the next 2 stitches. Repeat the last 4 stitches (2 double crochet in the same stitch, 1 double crochet for the next 2 stitches) until you reach the end of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. This completes your third round., Start each round with 2 chain stitches; this will count as your first ""double crochet."" Do 1 double crochet in the first stitch, and 2 double crochets in the second stitch. Next, do x-number of double crochets over x-number of stitches. Repeat the last few stitches (2 double crochets in 1 stitch, x-number of double crochets), until you reach the end of the round. Close each round with a slip stitch. The number ""x"" will increase with each round. For example:Round 4: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 3 stitches.
Round 5: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 4 stitches.
Round 6: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 5 stitches.
Round 7: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 6 stitches.
Round 8: After 2 chain stitches and 1 double crochet, repeat 2 double crochets in the same stitch, then 1 double crochet over the next 7 stitches.

, On your 9th round, chain stitch 2, then do 1 double crochet in each stitch for the rest of the round. Close with a slip stitch. Keep doing this for the next 18 rounds or so (until round 28).If this is for a child, consider doing 10 rounds.

, Begin with 1 chain stitch, then do single crochets for the rest of the round. Close the round off with a slip stitch., Start with 1 chain stitch. Next, do 1 single crochet for the next 5 stitches. Do 1 single crochet decrease over your 6th stitch. Continue doing 5 single crochets, 1 single crochet decrease, for the rest of the round. Close the round with a slip stitch. Here are some extra sizing tips:If this is for a child, do 5 single crochets, then 2 single crochet decreases.
If this is for a larger head, do 10 single crochet stitches, then 1 single crochet decrease.
If this is for an extra large head, don't do any decreases. Simply work more single crochets into the round.

If desired, you can take more precise measurements using a soft measuring tape.
For a full-body cover-up, hold the end of the tape at the height of your armpit, then extend it straight down to a point at your upper to mid thigh.
For a half-body cover-up, hold the end of the tape at your navel and extend it straight down to a point at your upper to mid thigh.

, Wrap a soft measuring tape around the widest part of the body your cover-up will need to fit around.

For most women, this will be the bust, hips, or stomach.
Make sure that the measuring tape wraps all the way around the widest part of your body. It should be taut without feeling tight, and it must also remain parallel to the ground.

, For this pattern, gauge isn't important. You will need to monitor the width and length of the piece as you work on it, however.

Even though gauge does not matter for this pattern, the type of yarn does. Use 100-percent cotton yarn since this type of yarn will not create a problem when it gets wet.
For worsted weight cotton yarn, an F-5 (3.75 mm) crochet hook is recommended.

, Tie the yarn onto your crochet hook with a slip knot. Chain stitch until you have a chain that is long enough to fit comfortably around the widest part of your body.

For a comfortable fit, make a chain that is 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) longer than your previously measured body width.
Regardless of the length of your chain, the number of chain stitches used must be a multiple of four.;
, When you reach the end of your chain, slip stitch the last stitch to the first, creating a large loop.

This loop should be able to fit comfortably around the widest part of your body.
Before slip stitching, make sure that the chain is straight. It should not be twisted or tangled when you join it.

, To complete the official first round, you will need to work a pattern of chain stitches and double crochet stitches into the chain stitches of your foundation ring.Chain two.
Double crochet once into the second chain from the hook.
Work six chain stitches from the loop on your hook. Skip over three chains of your foundation, then work one double crochet into the fourth.

Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round.


Slip stitch the last double crochet to the first stitch of the round.
Turn the work to the other side.

, Most of the second round can be completed with chains and double crochet, but you will need to work one triple treble crochet toward the end.

Chain eight. Note that this chain will act as one triple treble crochet and three chains.
Double crochet once into the first chain-six arch of the previous round.
Chain six, then work one double crochet into the next chain-six arch of the previous round.

Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round.


At the end of the round, chain three, then work one triple treble crochet into the last double crochet of the previous round. (See the ""Tips"" section for instructions on the triple treble crochet stitch.)
Slip stitch the first and last stitches of the round together, then turn the work.

, The third round also requires you to complete a pattern chain stitches and double crochets. No triple treble crochet is required for this round.

Chain one.
Double crochet once into the first triple treble crochet of the previous round.
Chain six, then double crochet once into the next chain-six arch of your previous round.

Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round. The final double crochet of this round should be worked into the other triple treble crochet of the previous round.


Slip stitch the last stitch to the first of the round, then turn the work.

, For the remainder of the fishnet cover-up body, repeat rounds two and three, alternating back and forth between the two.

Stop once the garment is within 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of your desired overall length. The remaining length will be reached when you complete the edging.
Do not fasten off the garment after your last round. Move directly into edging instructions.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into the first stitch of the last round of the fishnet body. Work one single crochet into each remaining stitch across the round.

Slip stitch the last stitch of this round to the first of this round.
Make sure that the right side of the garment faces you as you work. Do not turn the garment at the end of the round.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each single crochet of the previous round.

At the end of the round, slip stitch the last single crochet to the first. Do not turn.

, Chain four, then work a series of double crochet, chain stitches, and treble crochet across the entire round.

Skip three stitches, then work one treble crochet into the stitch after that. Chain three, then work four double crochet around the treble crochet you just created.Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the round.
Slip stitch the last stitch to the first to complete the round.



, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.

Weave the remaining excess into the wrong side of your stitches to hide it and further secure the tail.

, Attach the yarn to your hook with a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches 2 feet (61 cm) longer than the foundation chain previously created for the fishnet body.

Do not slip stitch the ends together into a loop.
If you do not remember how long your original foundation chain was, you can re-measure the circumference of the fishnet body using a tape measure.
Alternatively, you could compare the length of your new foundation chain to the circumference of the fishnet body as you create it.

, Single crochet once into the first chain of your foundation, then alternate chain stitches and single crochet back and forth across the remainder of the chain.

Skip the next chain, then chain one. Single crochet once into the following chain of your foundation.Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the row.



, Cut the yarn, leaving 2 inches (5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess tail through the loop on your hook to tie off the yarn.

Weave the remaining excess into the stitches of your drawstring.

, Weave the drawstring cord in and out through the top row of gaps in the fishnet. Leave 1 foot (30.5 cm) of cord hanging out from either side.The top row is the row not lined with the fish fin edging.
Start and end at the seam of the fishnet.
Do not tie or stitch the drawstring in place. It must remain loose.

, Put on the cover-up. Pull on the drawstring cord until the top of the cover-up lies snug against your body. Tie the drawstring into a bow to hold the cover-up in place.

Note that the seam and tie should be positioned to one side of your body.
For a full-length cover-up, tie the piece above your bust.
For a half-body cover-up, tie the piece around your waist.

 A fan motif in crochet notation.",How to Invent a Crochet Pattern,"

Master the basics of crochet. You don't need to know every crochet stitch, but you should know how to tie a slip knot and make a starting chain. You should also know how to single crochet, double crochet, slip stitch, and how to increase and decrease with single and double crochet. It's true there are lots of other stitches and combinations, but there is much you can do with just these basics. If you do learn other stitches you like, you can incorporate them in much the same ways as the standard stitches.

Notice what each stitch does, and make a practice piece or two if you need to.




 This hammock is made up entirely of chains with slip stitches to hold them together.

Chains start a piece of fabric or a new direction in an existing fabric. Chains can also be used as an element of their own.




 A row of slip stitches rings this edge and one slip stitch closes the previous round.

Slip stitches advance the hook without making the fabric very much taller, so they are used for things like finishing rounds. You can also do a whole row of them around an edge if you want for a finished look.




 This row of alternating chains and double crochets leaves open holes.

Treble crochet stitches are taller than double, and taller than single, but a fabric made of single crochet is tighter. A single crochet is about as tall as it is wide. A double crochet is tall enough to reach over a row of single crochet to the previous row, or leave a larger space.;
, These are all elements you can reuse in your own designs.





 This box is made from five rectangular pieces stitched together.

Pay attention to how to produce effects you can reuse, particularly the basic shapes. For example, to result in a rectangular piece of fabric with straight sides, you will need to make a turning chain at the end of each row, and rows of single crochet require chaining one whereas rows of double crochet require chaining three.You'll also want to learn to crochet in the round, both with and without combining rounds. Do you think you could make a box with a square base but with sides that increased? Could you make a cylindrical basket?
Notice rules and patterns in the pieces you crochet. For example, amigurumi is crocheted in the round, usually with joining rounds. In many cases, it makes it easiest to keep track of how many stitches you have and where to add them if each row contains a multiple of six stitches.




 A row of shells makes up this scarf.

You can reuse or vary elements such as motifs and stitches, too. If you have crocheted a granny square, you will probably be familiar with how to make and combine shells, which are simply clusters of taller stitches used together as a single element.




 A series of hexagonal motifs combined into the beginnings of a fabric.

A series of square motifs could be attached together to produce a sleeve or a tablecloth, depending on where you put them.

, It will help you figure out what you are doing as you go, and allow you to take notes and reproduce your designs later.

Remember that you can put a crochet stitch just about anywhere you can put a crochet hook. You can crochet into a row of holes on a hem (or a piece of paper), the side of a piece of knitting, or another piece of crochet. In fact, adding a decorative border to something, even a t-shirt sleeve or greeting card, is a good practice at improvising.
You can also go in a new direction at just about any point in a project by adding a chain and using it as you would a starting chain. You can also use chains as an element by themselves.

, Crochet does not take a lot of time to do, and chances are you have some leftover yarn around that you can use to make mistakes with confidence.

Look in craft store bargain bins for unwanted yarn at crazy prices. This makes excellent yarn for experimenting with.
Try garage sales and thrift shops, too. You can often pick up the leftovers from somebody else's project for pennies.

, Scrumbling is the process of making and combining smaller, free-form pieces into a larger piece. It can be used for a small, decorative element, as shown, or combined into a larger piece of fabric something like a patchwork quilt. Besides being a good way to use up odds and ends of yarn, scrumbling is good practice improvising and innovating with a crochet hook and making different shapes., These crocheted hand warmers are meant to be crocheted to your size, no matter what yarn and hook you are using., Stitches take up a certain width, depending on your yarn, your hook, and your technique. In this example, seven stitches make up two inches (5cm) of width. There are various ways you can use gauge.

You can guess and check how many stitches to make. Make some number of stitches, try on or measure the piece, and adjust as necessary to achieve the size you need.
You can adjust the number of stitches in an existing pattern that states a gauge so that your result comes out at the intended size.
You can calculate the number of stitches you will need to achieve a given measurement or size. It's a simple proportion. Multiply stitches per inch by inches to get the number of stitches you'll need. (This works equally well with centimeters, as long as you're consistent about which unit to use.)
If you want, you can do the same thing to figure the number of rows you'll need for the desired height of the piece. Simply measure the height of several rows in your sample piece, and calculate it the same way.

, A crocheted piece can be utilitarian, decorative, or both. You can make a flat afghan in square rows, a free-form sculpture, or anything in between. Perhaps a particular type or combination of yarn will inspire something. Perhaps a particular need (like keeping somebody warm) will inspire something.

Don't be afraid to sketch what you have in mind or make a small sample piece to test a concept. You may discover that you can make a piece, or you may discover what you'd like to do a bit differently.

, Make up your own scarf, bottle cozy, or arm warmers. Then try designing a vest or shawl before you attempt an entire sweater., If you want to be able to share the pattern you create with friends, post it online, or simply get a second sock or mitten to match the first, you'll need to take notes. They can be as simple or as detailed as you prefer, provided that you can make sense of them when you're done and, if need be, translate between your own shorthand and something another crocheter can read., Crochet allows you to make a fabric in a certain shape (which need not be flat). Having a sense of what the panels in stitched clothing should look like will give you an idea of what shape to make pieces of something like a sweater.

You can do things with crochet that you can't readily do by cutting flat fabric. For example, if you are crocheting in the round, you can increase each row to produce a disc. If you increase less than necessary to produce a flat piece, the result will be a fabric that dishes or cups. If you increase more than necessary to produce a disc, the fabric will curl and ruffle, taking on a shape like a potato chip. If you do not increase at all, you will get a cylindrical tube.
















,

Make a chart or diagram of what you want to crochet. If you can visualize this stuff in your head, fine. Otherwise, sketch out what you want to make. You can simply sketch the basic shape. You can add measurements and gauge information if you have it. You can even calculate numbers of stitches, if you choose.





 Crochet symbols.

One way to plan crochet is to learn and use crochet notation. The stitches will still need to fit together as you plan, but you can get some idea, especially if the pattern of stitches is complex. You can also use crochet notation to record your creations.

Know how to work a single crochet (this article is written in U.S. terminology) and know how to increase, and decrease while single crocheting.,

Choose any yarn you think would make good hand warmers.,

Make a sample piece.,


Know how to count stitches, both from the side of the fabric and along the edge.,
Decide about how far down the arm or wrist you want the hand warmers to go.,

Write down what you do as you go.,

Create the cuff.,

Chain some number of stitches according to how wide you want the cuff. ,

Chain three more (as a turning chain) and single crochet back across the row, starting in the third chain from the hook.,

Single crochet back and forth across this initial row.,

Create enough rows of this ""ribbing"" to wrap around the wrist of whoever will wear the hand warmers.,

Join the end of this strip to its own beginning.,

Turn the piece sideways and start working into the side of the strip you just made.,
Try on or measure the cuff again and increase or decrease the number of stitches if you need to.,

Single crochet around and around to produce the desired length.,

Increase and decrease gradually as needed.,

Create a division at the base of the thumb.,

Crochet to the first marked stitch.,

Try the glove again and add or remove stitches from the chain if it feels much too tight or too loose.
,

From here, continue to single crochet around just the fingers, but only into the opening that goes around the fingers.,

Optional for finger-less hand warmers: create an opening for the pinkie finger.,

Optional, for open-fingered hand warmers: stop crocheting around in a tube just under the knuckles.",How to Crochet Fitted Hand Warmers," If your crochet skills are rusty or still very new, you may want to do a few other simple projects (like Crochet a Granny Square) before trying hand warmers.

It will help to understand how to crochet in the round and how to keep a piece of crocheted fabric square when crocheting back and forth in rows.;
, The thicker the yarn, the thicker the hand warmers will be. That will make them warmer, but it will also restrict motion., Chain a few stitches (about two inches or 5cm should be ample) and single crochet two or three rows back across them. Measure how many stitches there are per inch or per centimeter. If you make two or three rows, you can also measure how tall a row of stitches is.
You can make these hand warmers entirely by feel, trying them on and increasing as necessary, or you can measure, whichever you prefer.

, You will need to be able to match one hand to the other, and it's much easier if you can count stitches and rows just by looking at them, rather than by trying to keep count as you go., You could start at the elbow, the wrist, or anywhere in between., You will size the first glove as you go, but you will need to know how many rows you made, and how much you increase in each row for the first hand. Also mark down how many rows come before and after the thumb opening. You will need this information to make the second hand the same as the first., You will create the cuff by stitching straight back and forth, making a rectangular piece that will wrap around the wrist.,, The length of this row will determine the length of the cuff, so hold it up or measure it now and add or remove stitches before proceeding.,

Crochet into only the back loop. This, when combined when reversing at the end of each row, will give the rows a ribbed appearance.
Chain one as a turning chain at the end of each row.
Crochet the same number of stitches in each row. If you started with a chain of eight (plus three to lead into the first single crochet), make sure you put eight single crochet in each subsequent row. If your piece is not rectangular, count the stitches in each row and make sure you chain one to turn.

, You can measure the wrist (or arm) and divide by the height of rows to get the number of rows, or you can just crochet until you have the needed length., Slip stitch or single crochet the two ends together to form the joint.




 The finished cuff.

Try to use the short tail as the ""bottom"". Slip stitch from the bottom to the top. You may need to add or remove one row of single crochet to orient the strip this way.
Measure or try on the piece once more at this stage. Remember that while the diameter must fit the wrist or arm of the person who will wear the hand warmer, the cuff must also fit over the broad part of the hand, so don't make it too tight. Try it on, if possible.

, Single crochet around the edge. You should make as many stitches around as you had rows of the cuff. A row is either a ""hill"" or a ""valley"" of the ribbing, and your stitches will probably fall into the loops in between., If you have a wrist or arm measurement, you can also do the math to get right the number of stitches in a round. Use inches or centimeters, but use the same unit to measure both the wrist and the stitches.
stitches = stitches per inch or cm x wrist measurement in inches or cm
You can also increase or decrease a little in subsequent rows if the first row is not too tight to slip the cuff on.
Generally, if you have the same number of rows in the cuff as stitches in the first round, the fit will be about right.

, Go ahead and join rounds., Decrease evenly if you are working from the elbow toward the wrist. Increase as you work from the wrist toward the thumb.
Increases and decreases can go by measurements or by feel.




 Increase right at the base of the thumb. The tail is being used for orientation.

When increasing for the thumb, make all the increases on the side of the glove near where the thumb will be. Add one to four stitches per row, as needed. It will help to use the tail as the base of the thumb, or to insert stitch markers.
If you want to make the hand warmers specific to the right or left hand, create increases before the thumb line or area for one hand and after the thumb line or area for the other hand. This puts the additional stitches (and thereby additional space) at the base of the thumb, right where it is needed and gives the back of the glove a clean appearance, free of the unevenness of the rows that the increases will produce.

, Try on the hand warmer again and, when the stitched tube reaches the web of the thumb or a comfortable distance above it, place a piece of yarn across. Decide where you would like to attach the connecting piece to each side, and mark the stitches. (See How to Make Wire Stitch Markers.), When you reach it, stop, and chain across the web of the thumb. Slip stitch into the marked stitch on the other side.,, Work into the chain you just made instead of going around the whole thumb. The fingers are fairly straight, so this will probably not need much increasing or decreasing.




 Add a thumb tube later.

You can add a tube for the thumb separately later, if you want to. Bring in a new piece of yarn and crochet around the opening.

, This is very similar to creating an opening for the thumb. It allows the finger tube to extend higher and still leave the pinkie finger out, able to move separately. This might be desirable if you are using finger-less hand warmers to play a musical instrument, type, crochet, or do other fine work.
Try on the glove to make a pinkie opening. The thumb is not in the same plane as the fingers, so it helps to have the thumb in the thumb opening to get the pinkie opening in the right place.
Don't bother with this step if these will be closed mittens.

, Crochet a few rows back and forth on the back of the hand only to keep this part warm while allowing the fingers to bend freely."

Most craft stores carry special types of yarn for knitting baby projects such as blankets and booties.
Select the yarn type and color that will fit your vision for the booties and that will make the booties feel nice and soft as well.;
, You will need a size G-6 (4 mm) hook to make these booties.The hook size is usually on the hook handle, but you can also get a hook sizer to check your hook size if you are unsure.

, Gauge refers to the number of stitches that is required to make a certain type of yarn reach a specific measurement. The gauge also relies on the needle size. Gauge is important to make sure that the garment you create will be the right size.








The combination of yarn and hook should yield a half double chain of 15 stitches that is about four inches (10 centimeters) long. If your gauge is off, adjust as needed with a lighter or heavier yarn or by changing the size of your hook.

, This chain will be the base of your first bootie. After you have your chain, you can turn back and begin single crochet stitch on the chain. Continue to crochet around the bootie foundation in single crochet stitch for one round.You should have 24 stitches when you finish the first round.

, Then, crochet eight half double stitches followed by five stitches with two half double stitches each. Then return to single half double stitches for the next eight stitches and then do another five stitches with two half double stitches in each one. Join this round with a slip stitch in the top of the beginning round.








You should have 32 stitches at the end of this round.

, Next, crochet 12 half double stitches followed by two stitches with two half double stitches each. Then, crochet single half double stitches for the next 12 stitches and follow these with another two stitches with two half double stitches in each one. Join this round with a slip stitch in the top of the beginning round.

You will need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. See the ""Tips"" section for more detail.
Also consult the ""Tips"" section for instructions on forming a chain stitch.;
, Work one single crochet into the second stitch from your hook. After that, work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row until you reach the end of the row.









Turn the piece over when you reach the end of the row.
If you do not know how to work a single crochet, check the “Tips” section for instructions.

, Work these stitches directly from the loop already on your hook.









This set of chain stitches will count as both a half double crochet and an additional set of two chain stitches.

, Skip the first stitch of your previous row. Then, wrap the yarn around the hook, insert it through the next stitch (the second stitch of the previous row), and catch the yarn on the other side. Pull the yarn back through to the front of the stitch.









Repeat this process two more times, moving onto the next stitch in the previous row each time. When finished, you should have seven loops on your hook.
This step starts the actual triangle stitch.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook again, then draw this last bit of yarn through all seven loops previously gathered onto your hook.









When finished, you will only have one loop on your hook.
This step completes the actual triangle stitch.

, Work these chain stitches from the loop already on your hook.









This will create a gap in between your individual triangle stitches.

, Follow the same steps indicated above to create another triangle stitch.









Yarn over the tip of the hook, then insert the hook through the last stitch you worked your previous triangle stitch into.
Yarn over the hook from the back and pull the yarn back to the front of the stitch.
Yarn over the hook, insert it into the next stitch, and catch the yarn from the back before pulling it to the front. Repeat once more with the following stitch.
Once seven loops have been gathered on your hook, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn through all seven loops.
This series of moves completes your second triangle stitch.

, Chain two, then repeat another triangle stitch exactly as described in the previous step. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the row.








, Chain once, then work one half double crochet into the last single crochet stitch of the previous row.









Turn the work over at the end of this row.
Read more about half double crochets in the “Tips” section.

, Work one chain stitch off the loop on the hook to advance to the next row.








, The placement of your single crochets will vary based on where they land in the row.









Single crochet once in the first stitch.
Single crochet once in the next ""chain one"" space from the previous row.
Single crochet twice into each of the ""chain two"" spaces from the previous row.
Single crochet once into the second loop of your original turning chain from the previous row.
Turn the work when finished with this row.

, At this point, you should have your foundational chain, your prep row, your first row of triangle stitches, and your second ""in between"" row. Repeat the steps used for the triangle stitch row and the ""in between"" row, alternating back and forth, until your project reaches your desired length.









Cut the yarn. Pull the tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it as much as possible to tie off the work. Weave the excess tail into the back of your work to hide it from sight.

Flip your work.At this point, your crochet hook should be at the far left of the piece you’re working.,
Find the first stitch of the previous row.,
Continue working in your pattern.",How to Turn in Crochet," For the very first crochet stitch, you need to create a slip knot on your finger.


Lay the yarn over your left index finger.
Holding the yarn from the free end, wrap it around your finger — going under then over — making sure to cross over the original yarn.
When you’ve finished, the original yarn should be on the right, and the free end should be on the left.
Both the free end and the end attached to the skein should be pulled down.
Pull the “original yarn” loop on the right up slightly.
Cross it over the “free end” loop so they switch positions.
Pull the “free end” loop, which is now on the right, up as you remove your index finger from the knot.
Pull to tighten the knot.;
, Make sure the loop is big enough to fit the hook through. When the hook is in, pull on both ends of the yarn to tighten the slip knot around the crochet hook.

, Make sure to work with the yarn that is attached to the skein, not the free end.


The crochet hook should have a flattened section, where you should place the thumb and index finger of your right hand.
Wrap the rest of your fingers comfortably around the lower half of the crochet hook, away from the actual hook/head.
Lay the yarn across the fingers of your left hand.
Raise you index finger and wrap your pinkie and ring fingers around the yarn. You will use the raising of the index finger and the grip of the pinkie and ring fingers on the yarn to create the necessary yarn tension.
Grip the bottom of the loop with your thumb and middle finger.

,
Move the head of the hook under and behind the yarn.
From that position, move the head over the yarn and back to the front, catching the yarn in the hook as you do so.
Pull the yarn through the loop being stabilized by your middle finger and thumb.

, Create a row of chains by repeating this exact process until you've reached the end of the row.


Follow the instructions in the pattern you're following.
If you're not following a pattern, make sure you keep track of (count and write down) how many chains you're creating per row, so your end product has an even edge.

, The turning chain is simply extra chains that will move you up to the next row of your crocheting. Depending on what type of pattern you’re using, you will create turning chains of different lengths.Single crochet: one chain
Half double crochet: two chains
Double crochet: three chains
Triple crochet: four chains

, Simply rotate your piece of crochet so that your hook is to the right of the fabric instead of the left. Think of it as turning the page in a book.

, Look at the base of the turning chain you made. The space directly next to it is where you want to insert the hook to begin your next row.

, Work the next row in whatever stitch you’re using. When you reach the end of that row, simply repeat these instructions.

You'll need to start your work by tying a slipknot onto the hook. If you do not know how to do this, see the ""Tips"" section for more detail.
You can also check the ""Tips"" section for instructions on working a chain stitch.

, Skip the first stitch of your previous row, then work one single crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.









When finished, this row should have 12 stitches.
Check the “Tips” section for more information about working single crochets.

, Work one single crochet decrease across the next two stitches of the previous row. Single crochet once in each of the next eight stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the final two stitches of the row.









When finished, you should have 10 stitches in this row.
If you do not know how to work a single crochet decrease, check the “Tips” section for instructions.

, For the next row, simply work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row.









This row should have a total of 10 stitches.

, Work one single crochet decrease into the first two stitches of the third row. Single crochet once into each of the next six stitches, then work another one single crochet decrease into the last two stitches of the row.









There should be eight stitches in this row when you finish it.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch of the fourth row to complete the fifth row.









This row should also have 8 stitches, just like the previous row had.

, Continue working rows with two single crochet decreases in them, separated by rows of nothing but single crochets. Repeat this for another seven rows, until you reach the twelve row.









Row six should have six stitches (one single crochet decrease, four single crochets, and one single crochet decrease).
Row seven should have six stitches (six single crochets).
Row eight should have four stitches (one single crochet decrease, two single crochets, and one single crochet decrease
Row nine should have four stitches (four single crochets).
Row ten should have two stitches (one single crochet decrease, one single crochet, and one single crochet decrease).
Row eleven should have two stitches (two single crochets).
Row twelve should have one stitch (one single crochet decrease).

, The basic triangle is finished at this point. To smooth out the edges, work one single crochet into each stitch around the sides of the work and three single crochets into the gap at each point.









Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 inch (5 cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook and tighten it to tie off the triangle. Weave the tail into the back of the work to hide it.

Check the “Tips” section for instructions on how to make a slipknot, chain stitch, and slip stitch.

, Work this secondary chain directly from the loop already on your hook.









These six stitches will count as your first double crochet , as well as the first corner of your first triangle round.

, Work three double crochets into the center of your ring. Chain three times to separate this set from the next.









Check the “Tips” section if you need further detail on working double crochets.

, Work another three double crochets into the center of the ring, then chain three more times off the final double crochet in the set.








, Make two more double crochets into the center of the ring. Slip stitch final loop of the second double crochet into the third chain stitch of the six-chain series you worked when advancing to this round.









This step completes the first triangle round. You can end the triangle here, or you can keep working additional rounds to expand it outward.

, Work six chain stitches off the loop on your hook.









As before, these chains will act as the first double crochet and the first corner of this round.

, Work these double crochets into the first ""chain three"" space of your previous round. Chain once to separate this set from the next.








, In the next corner gap, double crochet three times, chain three times, and double crochet another three times. End this double set by chaining once.








, You will need to repeat the previous step in the next corner space. Once you return to the first corner space, work two double crochets into the space. Use a slip stitch to join this final double crochet to the third chain of your original six-stitch chain from this round.








, Work six chain stitches off the loop on your hook.









This chain serves as both the first double crochet and the first corner of your third round.

, You will need to follow the same steps used on the previous round to complete this round. The only difference is that you will have chain spaces to work with as well as corner spaces.









In the first corner space, work three double crochets, then chain once.
In each corner space, double crochet three times, chain three times, then double crochet another three times. Chain one at the end of the set.
In each non-corner gap, double crochet three times, then chain once.
When you reach the first corner space of this round, double crochet twice into the space. Join this set with the third chain of your six-stitch chain using a slip stitch.

, The triangle can be used as is, but if you want to make it bigger, you only need to follow the previous step until you reach your desired size. Make sure that the final stitch you make is a slip stitch.









Cut the yarn, leaving a 2 to 3 inch (5 to 7.6 cm) tail. To knot off the triangle, pull this tail through the loop on your hook as tight as possible. You can weave the remainder of the excess tail into the back of the triangle to hide it.

Attach a loop of the body color yarn on the back of the head if you wish to hang the yip-yip.",How to Crochet a Yip Yip Alien," This project is perfect for using up a bit of leftover acrylic in a bright color. Also choose a suitable hook.
, Chain about two and a half to three inches' worth of stitches (7-7.5cm) for whatever yarn and hook you are using, perhaps 20-25 stitches. The length is more important than the number of stitches. The objective is to end up with a tube about an inch in diameter, or maybe a little bit more.

, Do avoid twisting the chain.

, That is, if the loop was about 1 inch (2.5cm) around, you should make it about 1 inch (2.5cm) tall. You're aiming for a rough proportion here, not any specific number of rows. It's all right to join rows, so that this part is a spiral.

, However, do not crochet a turning chain. Each consecutive row will therefore decrease. If you know how to do a single crochet decrease, you can decrease even more. Tie off the colorful yarn, but leave the tails for now. Here again, the exact proportions are not critical.

, Pinch the face together as you go to see how it will look., They'll take a little bit of extra time, but they have a bit more style and a better shape than anything you'll buy in the store. Leave the tails attached on the side of the eyeball and neatly tie off and trim the tails extending from the back.

, Use a large tapestry needle. You will want the face open at this stage so that you can reach inside to stitch the eyes to the inside of the fabric and tie a knot, but you can pinch it closed with your fingers to see where the eyes should go.


The eyes go very close to the top of the face. They are basically symmetrical, but this is a goofy looking alien, so it's all right if they're a little lopsided.
Tie the loose ends tightly. You can even tie them to one another. Then trim them close so they don't show through the mouth.

, Make sure all the tails inside are covered up, and tie in and trim any remaining loose ends of the tail.

, You may wish to cut one or two pieces first to get the length right. Four feet (1.2m) is a good length to start with., On the end opposite the face, which is to say the bottom end, put a hook through any loop from the starting chain. Fold one of the cut lengths of yarn in half and grab the middle with your hook. Pull it through.

, This creates a Larks Head knot, as shown in the first four photos under Steps in this article. You should now have two long tails with loose ends.

, Leave your hook in this loop.

, Make them fairly tight stitches; you want them to curl and you won't be crocheting into them. You may even want to use a hook that is a size or two smaller than the one you used for the rest of the body.

,, This is one tentacle. Chain a tentacle from the second loose end. Continue adding tentacles all the way around the base of the body. You can also chain the bottom tail from making the initial tube, rather than tying it in. It will camouflage with the rest.


It helps to make the tentacles all about the same length. You can eyeball it or count the chain stitches in a tentacle you like and do about that many stitches in the other tentacles.
The tentacles should be longer than the rest of the body is tall, by two to three times.
Don't do too few tentacles

, Done.

Add ties and laces as desired.,
Fashion any handles or straps you want and stitch them to the cozy or use the loops already built in to attach them.",How to Crochet a Water Bottle Cozy," The key to sizing this cozy is to get the right number of stitches to go that distance.

Because this is a crocheted fabric, it will be a little stretchy, so aim to crochet something that is a bit snug.;
, Chain until you have about three inches. Chain two more and double crochet into the third chain from the hook. Double crochet one stitch per stitch back across the row you created.
, Try to count in the middle to avoid figuring in any unevenness at the ends. Here, there are seven stitches (gauge stitches) in two inches (5cm) (gauge length). Measure the stitch length in the same units you used to measure the bottle circumference.
,


gauge stitches / gauge length = total stitches / bottle circumference
total stitches = (gauge stitches x bottle diameter) / gauge length
here, total stitches = (7 stitches x 9 inches) / two inches = 31 stitches.





For this example, round down to an even 30 stitches for easier math and a slightly tighter fit. Jot this number down.
Unravel the gauge piece if you wish to recover the yarn.

, The idea is to come out with a flat disk, about the same diameter as the water bottle or a bit smaller, and with as many stitches as the ""total stitches"" number above in the final row.
,,


The example shown uses a total 15 double crochet into the ring.






,, Then double crochet into each stitch from the first round. The example uses 2 stitches per inch to arrive at 30 stitches, the ""total stitches"" number from above. Add additional rounds if needed to produce the diameter required. See the tips below on how to do this.
, Chain two and double crochet one stitch into each stitch of the previous round.

You could chain one and single crochet this round instead, but the double crochet produces a sharper-looking ""corner"" at the bottom of the bottle cozy.
To avoid a spiral effect (optional): Place a stitch marker at the beginning of the round. Each time you reach it, join with a slip stitch and chain one. Otherwise, just stitch into the next available stitch. This is a bit more important (but still not required) if you want to make the ribbon loops.





At one stitch per stitch on a round piece such as this, two things should happen. First, the edges should curl up (or down) and start to form a cylinder. Second, you should have the same number of stitches in each subsequent round.

, If it's too loose, you'll need fewer stitches in the last row of the round base. If it's too tight, add a few stitches, either to the round base or to one of the bottom rows of single crochet right near the base. Either way, it's best to find this out now.
, With a good tie at the top, they are mostly decorative, but if you'd like, you can make them line up with a feature on the bottle, such as a narrower section.

If you don't want the optional ribbon loops, continue the entire bottle cozy in a single crochet until you reach the desired height.
Place the loops a bit lower than you think you will need them, remembering that the piece will stretch somewhat when in use.

, Finish the round at the bottom of where you want the loop.

Chain three.





Double crochet into the next two stitches from the previous round (total of three double crochet including the chain).






Triple crochet into the next stitch. The triple crochet is a little too tall for the row of double crochets around it, so it forms a sort of belt loop that will stick out if you tug on it a bit.





Continue the pattern of three double crochet followed by a triple crochet for the rest of the round. Make a one or two loops with only two double crochet between if you need to to come out even on number of stitches and loops.





Join with a slip stitch, chain 1, and proceed with additional rounds of single crochet as before.

,

Finish with at least one round of single crochet.
Stop short of the neck of the bottle.

, Chain six (or some other number that produces a desired length). Skip three stitches (or some other number that produces the desired spacing), and slip stitch into the next stitch. Repeat all the way around.

,, Any ribbon, cord or yarn will do. This cozy uses six strands of leftover yarn, braided tightly and tied in a simple knot at both ends to tie the bottle in.

Use a cord that doesn't stretch too much for the top closure.
Thread the ribbons through the loops formed by the triple crochet as you would a belt through belt loops. Tug on the loops gently to open them up, if needed. You can tie the ends in knots or bows, tuck them in, stitch them together, or leave them hanging loose to create the effect you prefer.





Lace a cord or braided yarn through the loops around the top and tie the bottle into the cozy. Tie it so that you'll be able to get the bottle out again for cleaning.






, You could crochet or braid them from any yarn that's left over, use more of whatever ribbon you're using, or recycle some fabric (perhaps an old necktie?), whatever you prefer.

At the end of the row, after joining the last chain of five, chain eight.,

Count the number of loops at the end of the fabric and, stretching the fabric about to the dimension you intend for the hammock, also measure the fabric.,

Cut dowels to the length desired and drill the appropriate number of holes in a dowel, evenly spaced.,

Clean up the edges of the holes with a craft knife or small round file.,

Run a string through each loop and double it.,

",How to Crochet a Toy Hammock," It can be any color and any thickness you think will look good with your toy. You may find you prefer cotton yarn or string, so that it isn't too stretchy.
,, Hammocks dangle down, so make the chain longer than the toy. This chain will form one side of the finished hammock. In this example, there are 108 chain stitches at this point., There are now 118 stitches in the example.

The first eight and the last ten stitches will form the loops at either end, which is why they're listed separately.

,,,, Chain 5, slip stitch into every fifth stitch, until you have the original 8 stitches remaining.

Don't worry if you don't find exactly eight stitches here. Just try to leave more than five and fewer than ten.

, Slip stitch to join in the first stitch of the original chain., This will start the third row., Slip stitch into the third stitch from the chain of five that forms the loop you're over., The last loop will be different.,, Chain eight and join in the third chain from the last slip stitch in the previous row., Chain eight and turn.,





 A straighter edge.

This matches the very first edge and makes the edge a bit straighter and tighter.

, Loop around and join to the corner of the fabric with a slip stitch. Tie off and sew in the ends. This produces a final loop for the corner., This will tell you how many holes you will drill in the dowel and how far apart to drill them. This hammock will have holes every half inch. The fabric is stretchy, so the interval between the holes can be approximate, but the number of holes must be correct.,

This is a 7/16"" dowel with 1/8"" holes every 1/2"", but use whatever size and spacing seems right for your fabric.
Drill the holes larger than you will need for just the yarn or string. It will make it much easier to assemble and hang the hammock.

, Also do any sanding that the dowels or the corners require. Jagged edges on the dowels will catch on the string. If you wish to apply any sort of finish to the dowels, do that now, too, and give the finish ample time to soak in and dry before proceeding., Leave the strings long so that you have leftover length.

It will help to hold the opposite end firmly. Here, it's wrapped around the other dowel and weighed down with books and things.

, Repeat for each loop and each hole., Center the bundle over the middle string if there are an odd number of loops or between the two middle strings if there are an even number of loops. Pull the strings gently so that they all have approximately even tension when the bundle is held in the middle.

It's important to get everything centered and even here so that the finished hammock will balance.
When gathering the second end, measure the distance along the middle string from the edge of the fabric to where you are holding the bundle and tying it.

,, For the one shown here, divide the strings into three (or more) groups and braid them. Wrap the loose ends of the braid back around the base of the braid. Tie another knot. Trim the ends to an even length.,"

",How to Crochet a Hat," Whether you're making this for an adult or a child will greatly change your yarn needs and crocheting tactics. Measure the circumference of the recipient's head. If that's not an option, follow these general guidelines:
3 - 6 mos: circumference = 13-14"" (33 - 36 cm); hat height = 6.5 - 7"" (15 - 18 cm)
6 - 12 mos: circumference = 16 -19"" (40 - 48 cm); hat height = 7.5"" (18 cm)
Toddler: circumference = 18 - 20"" (46 - 48 cm); hat height = 8"" (20 cm)
Child: 19 - 20 1/2"" (48 - 51 cm); hat height = 8.5"" (22 cm)
Teens: 20 1/2 - 22"" (53 - 56 cm); hat height = 9 - 10"" (25 cm)
Adult woman: 21.5 - 22.5"" (55 - 60 cm); hat height = 11"" (28 cm)
Adult man: 23 - 24"" (58 - 61 cm); hat height = 11 - 11.5"" (28 - 30 cm)
The circumference of the hat should be a bit smaller than the circumference of the head. About 1 inch (2.5 cm) will do. The ones listed are general head circumferences, not hat circumferences.;
, To crochet a hat, you'll need one skein of yarn, a crochet hook, a plastic tapestry needle, and a pair of scissors. All of these items can be purchased at your local craft store.

, This simply means to join two ends of a chain and work in a circle. To get started, chain 4. Then join together with a slip stitch to form a circle.

, Then mark the beginning of the row. Where your hook is now is the ""beginning"" of your new row and where it will end when you've completed your next circle.

, Join together with a slip stitch.

, On the next row, do 1 single crochet in the first stitch, then 2 in the next stitch. Repeat this step until you've achieved the width you want. Keep increasing your rounds until the circle you've created covers the top of the head.

, Repeat this step for as many rows as you'd like. Do fewer rows if you'd only like the hat to reach the top of the ears; do more if you want the ears covered.

, If you do choose to do this, simply increase your stitches again for a few more rows, by putting 1 single crochet in the first stitch, 2 in the next, and so on for as many rows as you like. Doing this to a only a few rows will make the end of the hat roll up a bit; doing it to several will create a floppier effect. Then tie off.

, With the tapestry needle, weave the tail back into the stitches of the hat.

This scarf is worked lengthwise, so the length of your chain will be the length of your finished scarf. You can make the chain longer or shorter depending on your desired length, but the number of chain stitches you choose should be a multiple of two.;
, For the first official row, work one single crochet into the second chain from the hook, then in each of the remaining stitches across the row. When you reach the end of the row, turn the work over.


If you do not know how to single crochet, check the “Tips” section for more help.
For this row, the ""right"" side of the scarf should face you.

, Chain one, then single crochet once into the first stitch of the previous row. For the remainder of the row, chain one, skip a stitch, then single crochet once into the stitch after that. Repeat that pattern until you reach the end of the row, then turn the work over.


For this row, the ""wrong"" side of the scarf should face you. From now on, each row you crochet should alternate back and forth between the ""right"" and ""wrong"" sides.

, For the third row, chain once, then single crochet into the first stitch of the first chain-one space of the previous row. For the remainder of the row, repeat the following pattern: chain one, skip the next stitch, then single crochet into the next chain-one space.


Single crochet in the last stitch and turn the work over when you reach the end of the row.

, Work one chain stitch, then make one single crochet in the first stitch of the previous row. For the remainder of the row, chain one, skip a stitch, then single crochet into the next chain-one space of the previous row. Repeat until you reach the last to stitches.


For the last two stitches, chain one, skip a stitch, and single crochet into the last stitch.
Turn at the end of the row.

, To complete rows five and six, repeat the same steps you used to complete rows three and four.


For row five, chain one, then single crochet once into the first stitch. Chain one, skip a stitch, and single crochet into the stitch after that; follow this pattern until you reach the end of the row.
For row six, chain one, then single crochet into the first stitch. After that, chain one, skip a stitch, then single crochet into the next chain-one space; repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the row.

, Chain once, then single crochet once into each stitch and each chain-one space. Continue until you reach the end of the row.


Turn the work again at the end of each row.

, Follow the steps used to complete rows two through seven as often as needed until you reach your desired scarf width.


A good width for your scarf is 5.5 inches (14 cm), but you can make it skinnier or fatter according to your own sense of style., Cut the yarn, leaving a tail measuring about 3 inches (7.6 cm). Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to knot the scarf and fasten it off.


Hide the rest of the tail by weaving it into the underside of the scarf.

, Reattach the yarn to the hook using a slipknot. Work a foundation chain of 60 stitches.


The foundation chain will need to be long enough to extend from one shoulder, over the top of your head, and down to the other shoulder. If this chain is not long enough, add more chain stitches. Make sure that the amount of stitches in your foundation chain equals an even number.

, Work one half double crochet into the front of the second chain from the hook. For the rest of the row, half double crochet into the back of the next stitch, then into the front of the stitch after that.Chain one when you reach the end of the row, then turn the work over.
If you do not know how to make a half double crochet, check the “Tips” section for additional help.

, For the second row, work one half double crochet into the front of the first stitch. Half double crochet into the back of the next stitch, then into the front of the stitch after that; repeat this pattern across the rest of the row. Chain once, then turn.


Repeat this pattern until you have a total of 18 rows.

, Leave a tail measuring roughly 1.5 feet (45.7 cm) long.


You will need to use this tail to stitch the hood together, so it needs to be close to the same length as your hood rectangle.

, Fold the hood in half crosswise. Use a threaded yarn needle to whip stitch along one side of the hood, from the open mouth up to the fold.


If you do not know how to whip stitch using yarn, check the “Tips” section for further instruction.

, When you get to the top of the hood, gently poke the top corner inward, creating a flat triangle. Stitch across the outside of this triangle with your threaded yarn needle.


This step is not strictly necessary, but it does allow the hood to sit flat on top of your head. If you skip this step, the hood will come to a rigid point behind your head, instead.

, The wrong sides should face out, and the right side should face in.

, Flip the hood so that the right side is turned in. Flatten it along its seam, then line it up with your folded scarf so that the center of the hood lines up with the center of the folded scarf.


Pin the scarf and hood together to secure them in place.

, Use a threaded yarn needle to whip stitch the edge of the hood to the scarf along the shared border.


You will need at least 1.5 feet (45.7 cm) of yarn to attach the hood to the scarf.
Make sure that you only stitch one side of the hood to one side of the scarf. Work carefully and do not stitch two sides of the hood together or two sides of the scarf together.
When done, weave any remaining yarn into the back side of your hood to hide it.

, Turn the hood and the scarf right side out again. Place the hood between two damp towels and let it remain there until the towels and scarf are all dry.


The towels only need to be damp, not soaked. If the towels are too wet, the scarf may take an excessive amount of time to dry.
You do not need to cover the entire scarf. Only the seams need to be covered.
This part of the process is not strictly necessary, either, but doing it can make the seams less visible.

, Your hooded scarf should be complete and ready to wear.

",How to Crochet a Granny Rectangle Scarf," This pattern is easy to adjust, so it's a good one to do with yarn left over from other projects or found inexpensively at garage sales or thrift stores.

The scarf in these photos was made of cream colored, mercerized cotton thread found in a thrift store. No weight or thickness is given on the label, but any comfortable weight will do.




 The hook is small to go with small thread.

This scarf used a size 00 hook. Use any hook that works well with the size of yarn or thread you choose.
Remember that smaller hooks and smaller yarns will require more stitches to get to a scarf of the same size.;

Put the yarn on your finger.,
Wrap the string around your finger.,
Pull on the X ""arm"".,
Slide the yarn through to form another loop.,
Adjust your loop.,
Hold the hook up in front of you.,
Pull the yarn up and over the hook.,
Catch the yarn with the hook.,
Pull the yarn through the loop.,
Repeat until you have as many chains as you want.,
Tie off your chain.,
Change direction to start a new row.,
Join the ends to form a circle.",How to Crochet a Chain," Stick out your pointer finger so that the nail is facing away from you. Now, drape the end of the yarn over your finger. The end should be on the front side of your finger, with about 1-1.5"" of yarn extending below your finger. The rest of string should fall behind your finger.


Use your thumb on the same hand pressed at your fingertip to hold the yarn in place.;
, Grasping the string behind your finger with your free hand, pull it toward you and then up and over your finger to wrap it around. You should see two loops formed around your finger. Now, adjust the second loop that you just made so that it goes over the top of the first loop, forming a sort of slanted X shape.









Once you've formed this X shape, you can hold the slack from the rest of the string in your middle and ring fingers on the same hand that is wrapped in yarn.

, Looking down at the top of your finger at the X which is formed, locate the upper ""arm"" of the X which is closest to the end of your finger (of the left if you made the loop on your right hand, on the right if made on your left hand). Pinch this arm with your free hand and pull on it just a little to make it slack.








, Now, from your fingernail side, reach under the arm and grab the other arm from behind it. Pull that string under and through. You should see another loop or circle start to form above your finger, made from the string you're pulling. Once it's about as big as the loop on your finger, slide the whole thing off of your finger carefully.









This should leave you with a clear loop and a very open, loose, beginning of a knot. If it doesn't, try again.

, Pinching the loop with your fingers, pull on the short end of the string to tighten the knot. Adjust as you go to make sure you don't end up with too much tail. You want to maintain a tail length of 1-2"". Once the knot is tightened, you should be able to slide it to create a bigger or smaller loop. Place your hook through the loop and set it at a comfortable tightness.









This structure that you've ended up with is called a slipknot and is the basis for starting most crochet projects.

, Hold the hook with the loop on it up in front of you. It should be pointing toward the opposite hand from the one that's holding it, with the long end of the string behind the hook. The loop should be sitting about 1"" down from the curved end of the hook.


This means that the knot should be below the hook.

, Taking the long end of the yarn, pull it up and over the top of the hook. The knot should remain below the hook and the rest of the yarn should now be in front of the hook.









This is called a yarn over.

, Pull the hook so that the curved end moves forward and catches the yarn you just pulled over the hook. The yarn should be nested in the hook now.

, Pull the yarn, using the hook, through the slipknot loop. You have now made your first chain.








, Repeat the process of yarning over and pulling it through until you have as many chains as you need for your project.


If you need to count chains, lay the chain flat. You should see a series of V shapes. Each V is a single chain stitch.

, If you just want a chain, such as if you're making a bracelet, you can tie off your chain when it reaches the desired length. Simply clip the yarn at least an inch from your last stitch, catch the last remaining end with the hook, and pull it all the way through the loop. Give it a good tug to secure the end.








, You can also change direction in order to start a new row. This will be the most common route for most crocheters. When you make a new row, you will be rooting your stitches in the chain that you made. How this is done will depend on your project, so you'll have to follow your pattern. The most likely options are to use single crochet or double crochet.









Before you start this new row, you will make a couple of extra chains (usually two, it can vary depending on the size and tightness of your stitches). Chain these extras and then root your next row in the last proper stitch in your chain.

, Another option is if you are crocheting a circle. In this case, once you are done making your initial chain (usually four stitches), you will join the ends together to form the beginning of your circle. This is done using a slip stitch.









With the last loop of your chain on your hook, push the head of the hook into the very first stitch on your chain. This will make two ""loops"" on the hook. Grab the yarn with your hook, just as if you were chaining normally, and pull it through both loops. This will leave you with one loop on the hook and you'll be ready to start your next ""row"".

If you're a newbie, pick a light color. This makes it easier to see how the stitches line up and what you need to fix.;
, A size H hook is a good choice for this weight of yarn. If you have some crocheting experience, you may adjust the size of the hook to match your personal crocheting style.








, This is the first step to all projects.









This is abbreviated as ""ch"" in most pamphlets.
If you don't know how to crochet or how to hold a hook, practice before making this flower.

, This stitch is used in every project as it can join work, finish rows by binding off, reinforce edges, or even move yarn over to a different position without interrupting the pattern.









""Sl st"" is the abbreviation for ""slip stitch.""
In this project, the slip stitch creates the initial ring of the flower.

, This counts as your first double crochet. It'll be the base to your petals.








, You should see the next ring start to form.









""Double crochet"" is abbreviated to ""dc.""

, The first part is done. Wahoo!









That slip stitch joins the second circle into a ring. That's the center of your flower!

, You're onto the petals!








, The abbreviation you'll find on patterns or crocheting websites is ""hdc.""








, The petal is starting to come to life!









""Dc"" and ""tc,"" respectively.
You may find that you want to vary the triple or double crochets, depending on the weight of your yarn and the size of your crochet hook. Three can be a bit wide for a smaller yarn.

, At this point, if you want a more elongated, sharper petal, add an ordinary chain (""ch""). If you prefer a rounder petal, skip this step.

Remember the choice you made. Use the same method for every petal, or your flower will look lopsided.

, This will round out the shape of your petal.








, Do you see the distinct shape of the petal?








, Return to the first step labeled ""make a slip stitch"" and run through the same steps to make each additional petal. Start in the next stitch every time you finish a slip stitch, until you have 5 petals.








, Voila! That's the last petal!









If you want a smaller flower, next time choose a smaller hook and a finer yarn. It's a little more difficult to work with and requires a bit more expertise.

, Run the yarn tail through a few stitches on the backside of the flower with your crochet hook and trim.

This will create a chain circle and you will be working your stitches into the center of this circle.To make the first chain, yarn over the hook twice and then pull the first loop through the second. Then, loop the yarn over again. Pull through the other loop. Continue until you have six stitches.To slipstitch, insert the hook into the end of the chain. Then, yarn over and pull it through both loops.;
, To begin working into the center, make a chain of three stitches. Then, double crochet twice into the center of the circle. This will complete one cluster of double crochet stitches and you will need to make a total of eight clusters or 16 double crochet stitches.To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over the hook again. Next, pull the yarn through the first stitch, and then yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the next two stitches on the hook, then yarn over the hook again. Then, pull the yarn through the last two stitches on your hook., After your first two double crochet stitches, make a chain of two. Then, double crochet twice into the center again.Continue to chain two and double crochet two into the center all the way around the circle. You should have a total of 16 double crochet stitches when you reach the end.

, To finish the first round, chain two after your last cluster of double crochet stitches. Then, use a slipstitch to connect the chain of two to the top of the chain of three that you made at the beginning of the round., Switch to your other color for the outside of the wing. To do this, cut the yarn a few inches from your hook and pull it through the stitch to secure it. Then, tie the new yarn around the space where the old yarn was connected. Then, begin working with the new yarn color.You will have two loose ends that you will need to work into the next round to hide them. To do this, lay them along the stitches that you will be working with next and then crochet around them.

, To begin the next round, you will need to double crochet into the chain two space six times. This will create a scalloped edge around your circle., After you complete your sixth double crochet stitch, use a slipstitch to connect the last stitch. This will help to create the scalloped effect for the double crochet stitches.Repeat this sequence all the way around the circle. When you reach the end, you should have eight scallops.

Then, wrap the chain around the center of the folded circle to secure it. The chain running down the center of the folded circle will resemble the body of the butterfly., To secure the chain, insert your hook into the first chain and then yarn over and pull the yarn through the stitch. Cut the yarn a few inches away from the hook and then pull it trough to create a knot., You will have a bit of excess yarn extending from the end, so you will need to sew it in. Thread the yarn through the needle’s eye and then sew the tail through the edge a few times to secure it. Then, snip the excess., To make little antennae for your butterfly, cut a small piece of yarn (a few inches long) in the same color as the butterfly’s body. Then, tie a knot into each end of the yarn. You can snip the excess closer to the knot if you cannot get the knots right on the end. Then, slide the yarn under the chain at the top of the butterfly’s body and then pull until the antennae are even."

Pull up the loop.,
Pull the second loop through the first.,
Repeat as needed.,
Bind off the yarn.",How to Surface Crochet1," Slide the tip of the hook into the spot where your surface design needs to start.


Insert the hook from the front of your work to the back of it.;
, Attach the yarn to the tip of the hook using a slip knot.


This slipknot must lie behind your work.
Note that you can skip the slipknot step, but using a slipknot adds security to the beginning stitch, so it is highly recommended.

, Bring the hook back through to the front of your work. The loop of the slipknot should be at the front of the work.


Both the tail and working side of the yarn should still be behind the work.

, Poke the tip of the hook into the next stitch, space, or row.


The right spot will depend on your design. If your design runs with the original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the next stitch or space of the same row. If your design runs against your original stitches, you will need to insert the hook into the corresponding stitch or space of the adjacent row.

, Wrap the yarn around the tip of your hook from behind your work.

, Bring the hook and yarn-over back through to the front of your work, drawing up a loop in the process.


There should be two loops on your hook when you finish this step.

, Use the hooked portion of the hook to drag the top loop through the bottom loop.


Doing this should leave you with only one loop on your hook.
This completes one surface slip stitch.

, Make additional slip stitches across the original work as needed to complete the desired design.


Note that surface slip stitches can be used to create single line designs, parallel lines, and free-form shapes., When you reach the end of your design, cut the yarn from behind the work, leaving a tail roughly 4 inches (10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook, still working along the back of the piece, to secure your surface slip stitches.


Weave the loose tail in along the back of your work.
This step completes the process and removes the last loop from your hook.

More specifically, insert the hook through the back horizontal bar of the stitch you're working over.
If you're familiar with standard single crochet, this back horizontal bar will be treated as the top portion of the stitch you'd usually work with.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front while the hook is still behind the overall piece. Pull the hook and this yarn-over back to the front of the piece, creating a loop in the process.


There should be two loops on your hook after this step.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again, working from back to front.

, Grab the previous yarn-over with the hooked tip and carefully pull it through both loops on the hook.


This completes one surface single crochet.
Note that there should be one loop left on your hook when you complete the stitch.

, Work as many single surface crochet stitches as needed to complete the desired surface pattern.


You will essentially be working a row of standard single crochet. Instead of inserting the hook through the next stitch in the row, though, you'll be inserting the hook through the next stitch of the piece you're decorating.

, When you reach the end of the pattern, cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Grab this tail with your crochet hook and pull it through the final loop on your hook.


This should get rid of the last loop on your hook and tie off your project.
Note that you should also weave in the loose tail end to hide it and help prevent the stitches from unraveling.

The hook should not be attached to any yarn yet.
Note that the right side of the piece should face toward you but the yarn should be at the back.

, Grab the yarn with your hook. Pull both the yarn and hook through to the front of the piece.


You should have one loop on your hook after completing this step.

, Insert the hook into the stitch or space directly next to the one you first worked in.

, Yarn over the hook from back to front. In one motion, pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the work while also pulling it through the loop previously on your hook.


If this motion is too difficult for you to master, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work first before pulling it through the loop on your hook.
You've essentially just completed one chain stitch over the surface of the original piece, thereby securing the yarn in place.

, Insert the hook back into the second worked stitch and follow the same procedure to create another chain stitch. Repeat this as many times as needed to build the size dot you desire.


For a moderately sized dot, create three to five of these stitches.
Each of these chain stitches must be worked over the same stitch of your original piece.

, When you're satisfied with the dot size, insert the hook through the stitch or space directly next to the one your chain stitches were worked into.

, Yarn over the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over back through to the front of the work while simultaneously pulling it through the loop already on your hook.


As before, you can pull the yarn-over through to the front of the work before pulling it through the loop if doing so is easier for you.
This final chain stitch closes the dot.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to finish and secure the stitch.


Pull the loose tail of yarn back through to the back of the work and weave it into the underside of the piece to hide it. This step also provides the dot with further security.

The right side of the work should face up and the yarn should be behind the original piece.
There should be no yarn on the hook at this time.

, Tie the yarn onto the hook using a slip knot.


The slipknot should be positioned near the tip of the hook and at the back of the original piece.

, Yarn over the hook from back to front, then pull that yarn-over through the loop on your hook to complete one chain stitch.


At the same time or immediately after completing the stitch, bring the hook and the yarn on your hook back through to the front of the original piece.

, Insert the tip of the hook into the stitch behind your first stitch, working in the opposite direction you would usually work in.


If you're right-handed, you will need to insert the hook into the next stitch to the right.
If you're left-handed, you will need to insert the hook into the next stitch to the left.
This step begins your first official crab stitch.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front, then pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the work, creating a loop in the process.


There should be two loops on your hook after this step.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front, then pull this yarn-over through both loops on your hook.


This step completes one crab stitch. Note that another name for this stitch is the ""reverse single crochet.""

, Repeat the crab stitch across the original work until you have completed your desired edging or design.


To complete each crab stitch:

Insert the hook into the reverse next stitch.
Yarn over, then draw up a loop to the front of the work.
Yarn over, then draw it through both loops on your hook.


Work in the same direction for the entire line of crab stitches. When completed correctly, you should be left with a ridged line.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 4-inch (10-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the final loop on your hook to fasten off your surface stitching.


Pull the excess tail of yarn through to the back of the work and weave it into the stitches along the back. This further secures the line of crab stitches while also hiding the tail.

Refer to the finishing steps at the end of the pattern.",How to Read Crochet Patterns," While it may seem too obvious, the title is the first step in determining if this is a crochet pattern you want to try. The title will let you know if the pattern is for a scarf, a blanket or some other item. Sometimes, the title may also offer you clues to the difficulty of the pattern.;
, Examine the pattern to determine if it is designed for beginner, intermediate or advanced-level crocheters. The difficulty is usually listed under the title. There is no reason to read through a pattern that is advanced if you are just beginning to learn to crochet.

, Look to see what the finished measurements of the project will be. If it is a pattern for some type of wearable garment, the sizes that are available from this pattern will be listed.

, Your pattern will tell you what type of yarn can be used and what the weight of the yarn should be. It will also tell you how much yarn you will need to complete the project. The crochet pattern will even tell you what size crochet hook to buy and if there are any other materials you will need to complete the project.

, Gauge refers to amount of crocheted fabric that a specific hook size and yarn type will create. While the gauge is less important if you have an unending supply of yarn and aren't worried about the size of your completed project, most of the time you need to be aware of the size of your crochet stitches.


To check your gauge, crochet a swatch approximately 4 inches (10.2 cm) by 4 inches in the stitch pattern listed in the crochet instructions.If your gauge is larger than the gauge indicated in the pattern, try a smaller hook. If your gauge is smaller, try a larger hook.

, You can look for tutorials on the Internet for any stitches you may be unfamiliar with. The basic stitch types include:chain
slip stich
single crochet
half double crochet
double crochet
triple crochet

, Some crochet patterns list a key with abbreviations and their terms.Some patterns assume that you know what the abbreviations stand for. Some of the most common abbreviations include:ch=chain
sl st=slip stitch
sc=single crochet
hdc=half double crochet
dc=double crochet
tc=triple crochet
inc=increase
dec=decrease

turn=turn your project over and start crocheting in the opposite direction
join=connect two stitches together
rep=repeat, It is common to encounter asterisks (*) in crochet patterns, so you need to know what they mean. Asterisks indicate that the steps provided need to be repeated in order until you reach the end of the row.For example, if you encounter instructions for a row that read: “Hdc in next 6 sts; *dc 2, sl st, dc in next st; rep from * to end,” then you will know that the instructions that follow the asterisk need to be repeated in order until you get to the end of the row.

, Regardless what pattern you are crocheting, the first step is to make a slip knot on your hook. The pattern likely doesn't tell you to start with a slip knot, it's assumed you already know where to begin.Make a loop with the end of the yarn, and slip the loop onto the crochet hook.
Wrap the yarn back over the crochet hook, and once again pull the yarn through the loop.Pull your crochet hook up with one hand while holding the other two ends of yarn to tie the slipknot tight.

, The steps will begin by telling you how many chains to make.Then, the steps will be listed in order by number of rows or rounds. You will crochet Row 1 followed by Row 2, Row 3 and so on. Keep crocheting rows or rounds until you complete the project.


All crochet patterns begin with a foundation chain. The foundation chain could be long, as for an afghan, or short, as for a motif that begins as a circle.A pattern may be worked in rows back and forth to form a flat piece such as an afghan, or in rounds worked around to form a tube with no seams, such as in a hat.If the pattern directs you to turn the piece, flip it over so you are working from the opposite end. For example, you might keep the top side in the same position and switch the left end with the right end, flipping the top over., This number lets you know how many stitches you should be crocheting. You may need to add or drop a stitch to get back on track with the pattern.


It is a good idea to count your stitches once every 10 rows or so, just to make sure that you are on track with the pattern.

, To stay on track with a pattern, it is important to keep track of the row that you are on by using a row counter, an app, or writing down your current row on a piece of paper.


Row counters fit right on the end of your hook and you will just need to click it forward each time you complete a row.
Apps are available to help you keep track of your rows as well. To keep track of your rows using an app, you will need to tap the screen every time you finish a row.
Pen and paper also work well for keeping track of your rows. You can simply write down your row number on the paper after you finish each row.

, As you get ready to complete your project, check the finishing steps provided in your pattern to determine if the project needs to be sewn together or blocked. The finishing steps will often advise you about how to add accessories as well, such as buttons or ribbon.

Only yarn over once.
Yarn over around the tip of the hook, just below the hook opening and above the loop already on your hook.;
, Slide the tip of the crochet hook into the stitch in which you want to make your half double crochet.


If you are following a crochet pattern, this stitch should be specified in the instructions.
Only the tip of the hook needs to be inserted into the stitch. You do not need to draw any of your yarn loops through.

, From the back of the piece, wrap yarn over the tip of the hook and into or just below the opening of the hook.


As before, only yarn over once and do so by wrapping the yarn from back to front.

, Pull the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch. This action should turn the yarn-over into a loop.


At this point, you should have a total of three loops on your hook.
Note that the opening of the hook will need to latch onto the yarn-over as you pull it back through to the front.
If you have difficulty sliding the hook back through, you may need to keep a little tension on the chain or row by pinching it between the thumb and forefinger of your opposite hand (the hand not holding onto the hook).

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook one time, working from back to front.


For this yarn-over, make sure that the opening of the hook catches the yarn as you wrap it around.

, Drag the yarn-over through all three loops lying below it on your hook.


The yarn-over will need to lie in the opening of your hook and the loops will need to pass over the top of the hook completely.
You may need to twist the hook so that the opening faces down as you draw it through the loops on your hook. Otherwise, the opening could accidentally latch onto one or more of the loops.
This step completes one half double crochet.

, Attach the yarn to your hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation chain that is one chain stitch longer than the number of half double crochet stitches called for in your first row.









For example, if your first row should have 15 half double crochets, your chain must have 16 chain stitches.
If you need help making a slipknot on your hook or forming chain stitches, please check the ""Tips"" section of this article for further instruction.

, When preparing to make a half double crochet, count three chain stitches in from your hook. You will skip over the first two chains and work the stitch into the third chain.









Note that the two stitches you skip will count as your ""turning chain."" A turning chain is a small chain made at the start of a row that raises the row height to the height of the stitch.
Do not count the loop on your hook as a chain.

, Make a half double crochet stitch into this third chain from your hook, following the instructions previously outlined in the HDC section of this article.

Draw this yarn-over back to the stitch and to the front of the chain. There should be three loops on your hook by this point.
Yarn over the hook once more, working from back to front.
Draw this final yarn-over through all three loops on your hook. This action completes one half double crochet.

, For your next half double crochet, you do not need to skip any chains. Work the half double crochet directly into the next stitch of your foundation chain.









Follow the same instructions as before:

Yarn over.
Insert the hook into the next stitch.
Yarn over.
Draw the yarn-over to the front of the chain.
Yarn over.
Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on the hook.



, To complete a full row of half double crochets, continue making half double crochets until you reach the last stitch of the chain. Do not skip any stitches; instead, work each half double crochet into the chain directly next to the stitch you just finished.









When you finish, there should be one less half double crochet stitch as there were chain stitches. For example, if your foundation chain had 16 stitches in it, you should be able to complete 15 half double crochets. This count includes the ""turning chain"" (the two skipped stitches) at the beginning of the row.
Note that for most crochet pieces, you will need to flip the work over once you reach the end of the row before you begin working on the next row.

, Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook to complete this turning chain.


A turning chain exists for the purpose of building the row height up to the height of the stitch before working any actual stitch.
This turning chain will count as one half double crochet stitch when you count your stitches at the end of the row.
If you need help making chain stitches, please check the ""Tips"" section of this article for additional instruction.

, Skip over the first half double crochet stitch of your previous row. When you work the stitch, you will do so in the second half double crochet from your previous row.


Note that the same concept applies if you are working a row of half double crochets off a row built with a different type of stitch. You will still need to make a turning chain and you will still need to skip over the stitch directly below that turning chain.

, Make a standard half double crochet into the second stitch of the previous row. When you insert the hook into your stitch, insert it from front to back and make sure that it goes through the top two loops of the previous row's stitch.


Yarn over from back to front.
Insert the hook into the top two loops of the second stitch from the previous row.
Yarn over from back to front.
Draw this yarn-over back to the front of your row, creating a total of three loops on your hook.
Yarn over from back to front.
Draw this yarn-over through all three loops on your hook to complete the half double crochet.

, To complete a full row of half double crochet, work one half double crochet into the top two loops of each stitch from the previous row. Continue this step until you reach the end of the row.


Again, use the steps outlined for a basic half double crochet:

Yarn over.
Insert the hook into the next stitch.
Yarn over.
Draw the yarn-over to the front of the row.
Yarn over.
Draw the yarn-over through all three loops on your hook.


Do not skip any other stitches as you work your way across the row.
You will usually need to flip the work over if you plan on making another row after this one.
Any additional rows of half double crochet should be completed using the same steps outlined here.

Make your last stitch.,
Cut some extra thread.,
Start as if making a single crochet chain.,
Pull the thread all the way through.,
Tug to secure the knot.,
Weave in the ends.",How to Finish off Crochet1," Make the final stitch in your row, just as you normally would before starting extra chain stitches to turn around and move on to the next.;
, Cut the yarn about 4-6"" from where it comes off the piece you are working on. This extra thread is called the tail.

, You should have one loop on your hook at this point. Now, catch the yarn on your hook and pull it towards the loop as if you were going to make another chain.

, Now, instead of creating a loop with the yarn, pull the thread all the way through the loop.

, Give the tail a firm pull. You should see the loops behind and around it tighten up until it looks like your piece ends in a knot. Technically you are done, though you should not generally stop here as this connection can come undone.

, Take your tail and weave it back through the stitches that you have made. This will hide the tail and keep it from unraveling the knot you just made.


Now, there are LOTS of different theories on the best way to weave the yarn through the piece. Some people use a yarn needle, others use the crochet hook, some people weave the thread back and forth through the first and/or second rows, some people pull it in a single line through the middle of the first row. Experiment and find a way that you like but most methods likely work equally well.

Weave in the remainder of the tail.",How to Finish off Crochet2," Do the last stitch as you normally would while working in the round. Stop just short of chaining extra to start a new row.

, Cut the yarn about 4-6"" from where it comes off the piece you are working on. This extra thread is called the tail.

, Now pull on the loop that you have started until all of the thread comes through and you have a loose tail., Get a yarn needle and thread the tail through the needle.

, Now, you'll have the two sides of your row on the circle, separated by a V shaped gap. Your needle and thread should be on one side: you're going to bring them over to the other. Put the needle just under the first stitch, just past the beginning chain, and pull the tail under both loops.

, Pull the tail to bring the two sides of the V together and close the gap.

, Go back to the last stitch that you made, on the first side. Put the thread through the back loop of that first stitch, from the facing side, and then pull it through. It should now look like a normal chain in the outside row, completely invisible.

, Weave the tail down towards the center a bit and then back up. Weaving in two directions will be necessary to keep the tail from coming loose.

Note that each consecutive yarn-over should be made in between the last one and the opening, not in between the previous yarn-over and the starting loop on your hook.;
, Slide the tip of the hook into the stitch indicated in your pattern instructions.


Only insert the tip of the hook. Do not draw any of the yarn already on your hook through the stitch.
Keep the working yarn behind your crochet piece as you continue along.

, With the opening of the crochet hook still behind the piece, wrap the yarn over the hook once, letting this yarn-over slide into the opening of the hook.


Wrap the yarn from back to front.

, Pull the crochet hook back through to the front of the stitch, bringing the most recent yarn-over with it. Note that the yarn-over has now turned into a loop.


There should be five loops on your hook at this point.
You may need to keep tension on the previously worked portion of the piece using the thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand (the hand not holding onto the hook). Doing so can make it easier to slide the hook in and out of the stitch.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook once more time.


Work from back to front again.
Let the yarn-over slip into the opening of the hook.

, With the previous yarn-over caught in the hook opening, draw it through the top two loops previously on your hook.


If you have difficulty drawing the yarn-over through the loops, gently twist the hook so that the opening faces down and try again.
You should be left with four loops on your hook at this point.

, Yarn over the hook, then draw the yarn-over through two loops. Repeat this three more times until you are left with only one loop on your hook.After the first repetition, you will have three loops left on the hook.
After the second repetition, you will have two loops remaining on the hook.
After the third repetition, you will only be left with one loop on the hook.
Once you complete this step, you have completed one DTR (double treble crochet) stitch.

, Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot and create a foundation chain. Your foundation chain needs to have five stitches more than the number of double treble crochets you want in your first row.


For example, if you want to create a row of 10 double treble crochets, you need to start with a foundation chain made of 15 chain stitches.
If you do not know how to make a chain stitch or a slipknot, please check the ""Tips"" section for additional help.

, Skip over the first five stitches next to your hook and work one standard double treble crochet into the sixth stitch. Use the same method described in the ""Double Treble Crochet Stitch"" section of the article.


Yarn over three times.
Insert the hook into the stitch to be worked. In this case, it is the sixth stitch.
Yarn over once.
Draw the yarn-over back through to the front of the stitch to create a loop.
Yarn over once.
Draw the yarn-over through two loops.
Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops.
This completes the stitch.

, Work one double treble crochet into each chain of your foundation chain. Continue doing this until you reach the end of the chain.


To complete a straight row, only make one double treble crochet per stitch.
Once you reach the end of the chain, you have completed a first full row of double treble crochet.

, If you have not done so already, flip the crochet work over so that its front becomes the back and its back becomes the front.


Note that this technique applies if you are working on your second row or any row after that. It will vary slightly from a row of double treble crochet completed from a foundation chain.

,


The purpose of a turning chain is to extend the yarn up to the finished height of your next row, and the height of that turning chain is based on the type of stitch you will be making in that row. For a row of double treble crochet, you need a chain of five stitches.
When counting the stitches in this row, you will count your turning chain as one double treble crochet.

, Work one standard double treble crochet stitch into the second stitch of the previous row, counting the stitches starting at your hook. When the time comes, insert the hook into both top loops of the stitch, working from front to back. The double treble crochet you make now should follow the basic instructions provided in this article.


Yarn over three times.
Insert the yarn into the stitch to be worked. In this case, that should be the second stitch. Make sure that you insert the hook into both top loops from front to back.
Yarn over once.
Draw the yarn-over into a loop at the front of the piece.
Yarn over once.
Draw the yarn-over through two loops on your hook.
Repeat three more times: yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops; yarn over, draw it through two loops.
When you only have one loop on your hook, the stitch is complete.

, Make one and only one double treble crochet in each stitch of the previous row. Continue until you reach the end of the row to complete a full row of double treble crochet.


Note that for future rows, you will need to make your last double treble crochet into the fifth stitch of the turning chain from the previous row.
You can complete as many rows of double treble crochet as desired using this technique.

Fasten off the yarn.",How to Crochet with Chunky Yarn," Chunky yarn is only one term commonly used to identify yarn types within the broader ""bulky yarn"" category.


Many yarn brands will label the yarn as ""chunky yarn,"" but there are a few synonymous terms that other brands may use to describe the yarn. These terms include ""craft"" and ""rug"" yarn.
A better way to identify chunky yarn is by knowing its yarn weight symbol. The symbol for chunky yarn and all other forms of bulky yarn is ""5.""Note that the only thicker yarn category is category 6, ""super bulky."" Some yarns in this category might be called ""super chunky."" Super chunky yarn and chunky yarn are not quite the same, so you should keep that in mind when making your yarn selection.;
, The right crochet hook to use can vary by project, but when no hook size is specified, you should choose a hook size that falls within the standard recommended range.


Larger hooks tend to be best for chunky yarn. In U.S. sizes, look for a hook between K-10-1/2 and M-13. In metric sizes, look for a hook between 6.5 and 9 mm.
If you end up picking a super chunky yarn, the recommended hook size is M-13 and up in U.S. sizes or 9 mm and up in metric sizes., When working with single crochet, a 4-inch (10-cm) square made with chunky yarn will typically consist of 8 to 11 stitches.


For super chunky yarns, a 4-inch (10 cm) square of single crochet would consist of 5 to 9 stitches.
Gauge refers to the number of stitches needed to form a 4-inch by 4-inch (10-cm by 10-cm) square using a certain type of yarn. For simple projects, like scarves and blankets, precise gauge measurements are not as important to note. For more advanced projects, like sweaters and socks, you will need to know the gauge of your yarn to prevent the final piece from being too small or too large to fit properly.

, Figure out what it is that you want to make with chunky yarn. If you're still a novice, it would be best to find an actual pattern to work from. More advanced crocheters can devise their own patterns and work from there.


You can adapt a pattern that uses another type of yarn for use with chunky yarn, but doing so can be a bit difficult. Compare the two yarn gauges and determine how many more or fewer stitches you'll need to make when switching. You'll also need to use a hook that differs in size from the one recommended in the pattern instructions.

, Yarns can be made from different fibers, even yarns of a single thickness. Each fiber will have a different texture and appearance. Experiment with different fibers until you find one that you like.


As a general tip, consider the intended use of the project when picking out a fiber material. A blanket or scarf will need a softer yarn fiber than a rug or handbag would probably need.
Acrylic wool is a mix of natural and synthetic fibers.It tends to be inexpensive and durable, making it ideal for projects like rugs and purses. It can also be used for sweaters and scarves but may not be soft enough for those with sensitive skin.
Cotton wool is soft, durable, and natural. It is generally preferred for sweaters and scarves but may still be too rough for those with very sensitive skin, like infants and toddlers.
The softest wools are cashmere, silk, mohair, lambs, and alpaca. Cashmere and silk wools are typically used for scarves, shawls, and wraps, but they are more delicate and require more care. Mohair, lambswool, and alpaca wool tend to be used for blankets and sweaters, but they also require special care.

, This step applies to any yarn you shop for, and chunky yarn is no exception. You'll need to figure out which color or color you want to use for your project.


Once you figure it out, buy the full number of skeins you will need. It's better to have too many than too few. The dye can be slightly different from batch to batch, so buying the same hue by name at two different times can result in having too slightly different shades. You can avoid this problem if you buy the yarn all at once.
To be on the safe side, you should also check the ""lot"" or ""dye lot"" number on the back label of each skein. Make sure that the dye lot number on each skein is the same before you buy them. Otherwise, you may still end up with different shades.To determine which color is best, ask yourself about the project. Consider picking your favorite color if the project is for yourself, or your friend's favorite color if the project is for a friend.
Also ask yourself which colors would match well with the intended use of the piece. For instance, choose a color that matches your coat if you plan on making yourself a scarf or a color that matches your bedroom if you plan on making yourself a blanket.

, Attach the yarn to the top of your crochet hook with a slipknot, leaving only a small tail.


If you are using chunky yarn, use a size L-11 (8 mm) hook for this project.
If you decide to use super chunky yarn, use a size N-15 (10 mm) hook, instead.
You will only need two skeins of yarn if you want to create a cowl. For a longer infinity scarf, you may need up to four skeins.
To make a slipknot:

Cross the attached end of the yarn over the loose end in a loop.
Pull the attached side through the loop, drawing up a second loop. Tighten the first loop around the second.
Tighten the second loop onto the hook.



, Determine how wide you want the scarf to be, then make a series of chain stitches from the loop on your hook to match that width.


For a cowl, you'll need to make a foundation chain of about 26 stitches with chunky yarn or 31 stitches with super chunky yarn.
For a longer infinity scarf, the chain should have about 36 stitches with chunky yarn or 41 stitches with super chunky yarn.To make a chain stitch:

Wrap the yarn halfway around the hook from the back.
Pull this yarn-over through the previous loop on the hook. This completes one chain stitch.



, Count the stitches in your foundation chain, stopping once you reach the sixth one from the hook. Work one double crochet into that sixth stitch.


For this project, you should work each double crochet into the single loop at the back side of its respective stitch. Do not crochet into the front side loops.
To double crochet:

Wrap the yarn once over the hook.
Insert the hook into the indicated stitch.
Yarn over the hook from the back of the stitch.
Pull the yarn back through the stitch and to the front of the work.
Wrap the yarn over the hook again. Draw this yarn-over through the first two loops on the hook.
Wrap the yarn over the hook once more. Draw this yarn-over through the last two loops on the hook.



, Work two chain stitches from the loop currently on your hook.

, Work one more double crochet into the exact same spot you worked the previous double crochet in.


The first double crochet, the two chain stitches, and this second double crochet all combine to form one V-stitch.
You'll be repeating the V-stitch all throughout the project.

, Skip over two stitches in your foundation chain, then work another V-stitch into the stitch after that. Skip over another two stitches, then work another V-stitch into the stitch that follows. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the foundation chain.


For each V-stitch:

Double crochet once into the correct stitch.
Chain two.
Double crochet once more into the same stitch.


You should finish the row by working one double crochet into the last stitch of your foundation chain.

, Flip the work over so that the hook is on your dominant side again, then work a turning chain of three chain stitches.


This turning chain brings the height of the next row up to the correct stitch height. Without the turning chain, the width of the scarf will be uneven.

, Work one double crochet into the first of the chain-two spaces created in your previous row.


This is the beginning of your first V-stitch for this row.
Make sure that you crochet into the first chain-two space. If there is another space before it, you should skip over it and work directly with the chain-two space. Otherwise, the final width of the piece might be uneven.

, Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.

, Work one more double crochet into the same space as the first double crochet of the row.


This step completes the first V-stitch of this row.

, Work one V-stitch into each chain-two space created in your previous row. Continue until you reach the end of this row.


End the row by working one double crochet into the second loop of the last double crochet of the row below.

, Each row should be worked in the same way as the previous row. Make as many rows as desired until you reach your ideal length.


Chain three at the end of each row.
Work one V-stitch into each chain-two space of the previous row.
Work one double crochet into the second loop of the last double crochet at the end of each row.
A cowl will only need to be long enough to fit around your head and neck, or about 18 inches (46 cm). An infinity scarf will need to be two to three times longer, or about 48 inches (122 cm).

, Fold the scarf in half crosswise, halving the length. Make sure that both edges are evenly aligned and all four corners meet.

, Work one single crochet into the first stitch of the top layer and the first stitch of the bottom layer at the same time.


Repeat this process, working one single crochet into each set of stitches from both layers, until you reach the bottom corners of the scarf.
This creates a neat, barely visible seam along the back of your scarf or cowl.
To make a single crochet:

Insert the hook into the indicated stitch.
Yarn over the hook from the back.
Pull the hook back through to the front of the stitch.
Wrap the yarn over the hook once more.
Pull this final yarn-over through both loops on your hook.



, Cut the yarn, leaving a 3-inch (7.6-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the final loop on your hook. Weave any excess yarn into the back side of your scarf to hide and secure the remaining tail.


This step completes the project.

With your current loop on the hook, pull the tail of the yarn up, behind the hook. Then pull it down over the front side of the hook, so that it lays over the shaft/throat, and tucks just under the actual hooked region. When you later pull the hook through a stitch, your yarn will come with it.
This is called yarning over, and it's done from back to front as part of many crochet stitches. Once you get into your flow, you'll be able to yarn over with just a quick twitch of your hand and twist of your hook.;

If you do not know how to make a double crochet, see the “Tips” section for instructions.;
, Remove the hook from the last stitch, leaving an open loop. Re-insert the hook into the top hoop of the first stitch in the popcorn group, then back through the open loop.









At this point, you will have two loops on your hook: the first loop of the popcorn group and the last loop of the group.

, Slip stitch by pulling the open (end) loop through the loop of the first stitch, which should already be on your hook.









Use your finger to gently poke the popcorn stitch to the right side of the surface.
This step completes the actual popcorn stitch.

, Oftentimes, you will need to repeat the popcorn stitch to create a pattern over your piece. Popcorn stitches are almost always separated by at least one or two chains, though, and are rarely positioned side-by-side.








, Chain stitch a foundation chain using a number of stitches divisible by three.









For instance, your chain might have 12, 15, or 18 chain stitches.
You'll need to begin by making a slipknot on the hooked end of your crochet hook. See the ""Tips"" section for instructions on how to make a slipknot.
If you have never made a chain stitch, see the “Tips” section for guidance.

, When you reach the end of your foundation chain, make a single crochet into the second stitch currently from the hook. From there, make one single crochet into each stitch of the original chain.









If you do not know how to make a single crochet, see the “Tips” section for precise instructions.

, Make one chain stitch to advance to the next row. Turn the piece, then single crochet once into each of the next two stitches.








, In the next stitch (the third established stitch of your previous row), work five double crochets. Keep the last loop of each stitch on the hook as you work.









This is the start of your actual popcorn stitch.
If you do not know how to make a double crochet, check the “Tips” section of this article for details.
Note that the popcorn stitch technique you will use for this method varies slightly from the basic stitch mentioned in this article since you need to work with the top loops of each double crochet in the popcorn group, instead of only working with the first and last loops.
If you find it difficult to keep all the loops on your hook as you work, simply work the double crochets as normal and remove the hook from the last open loop at the end. Re-insert the hook through all five top loops of each double crochet in the group, as well as the sixth open loop at the end of the group.

, Wrap the yarn around the hook once, then draw it through all six loops currently on your hook.









This step completes the actual popcorn stitch.
See the “Tips” section of this article if you need additional help with the slip stitch.

, Make one single crochet into each of the next three stitches of the previous row.

, Create another popcorn group in the next stitch using the previously described steps. Single crochet once into the next three stitches again. Work across the rest of the row in this pattern until you reach the end of the row.








, Make one chain stitch to advance to the next row. Single crochet once into each stitch of the previous row to even out the stitches.









When you reach the popcorn stitch, work one single crochet into the back side of the center stitch of the popcorn.

, Work another row of popcorn stitches as previously described, followed by another row of single crochets. Repeat this pattern until you reach the end of the piece.

, Make a foundation chain of 13 chain stitches.









You will need to attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slipknot before you can make your foundation chain. If you have never made a slipknot, see the ""Tips"" section for instructions.
You should also consult the “Tips” section if you need instructions on making a chain stitch.

, Double crochet once into the fourth chain away from your hook. After that, double crochet one into each established chain until you reach the end of the row.









If you do not know how to make a double crochet, check the “Tips” section of this article for details and instructions.

, Make three chain stitches to advance to the next row. Turn the piece before continuing.








, Skip the first double crochet of your previous row, then double crochet once into each of the next five established stitches.








, Work five double crochets into the next stitch, which should be the seventh stitch of your previous row.









This step starts the actual popcorn stitch.
Note that this popcorn stitch is almost the exact same as the popcorn stitch described in the basic method section.

, Remove the hook from the open loop. Weave the hook into the top of the first loop in your popcorn group, then back into the open loop. Pull the open loop through the first loop to close the popcorn group.









You may need to push the popcorn group to the right side of the material. You can do so using your fingers.
This step completes the actual popcorn stitch.

, Work one double crochet into each remaining stitch until you reach the end of the row.








, Advance to the next row by chaining three times and turning the piece. Make additional rows by working the same stitches used in your previous row. Repeat as often as needed until you reach the end of the piece.

Slipstitch to join the ends of the flower petal into a cone.",How to Crochet Petal Cone Edging," Making cone petal flowers does not require anything different from regular crocheting. You will need:

Crochet hook
Yarn
Scissors;
, You may want to practice petal cone edging by making a small flower. To do this, you will need to make a chain circle. First, crochet a chain of six and then join it in a circle with a slipstitch.If you already have a crocheted project that you want to edge, then you do not have to worry about making a circle. You can just begin by making the bases for the cone flowers along the edges of your project.

, Next, you will need to single crochet 15 stitches around your chain circle. Insert the hook in through the center of the circle—not through the stitches—and single crochet around the chain.To single crochet, loop the yarn over the hook and then insert the hook through the center of the circle, then loop the yarn around the hook again and pull this new loop through the other loop on your hook.This will create a stitch around the chain.

, Insert the hook in through the first single crochet in your round and then loop the yarn around the hook and pull it through the stitch and the other loop.This will join the end of your round with the beginning of your round., Start the second round by chaining six stitches. This will provide a long enough chain to form the first space in your second round. You will be connecting back into the middle of this chain at the end of the round, so don’t worry if it looks a bit odd right now., Next, skip over the first stitch and double crochet into the next one.To double crochet, loop the yarn over your hook, and then insert the hook into the stitch. Then, loop the yarn over again and pull it through the first two stitches. Then loop the yarn over again and pull it through the last two stitches., After the first double crochet, you will be following a pattern of chaining three, skipping a stitch, and double crocheting for the rest of the round. Chain three, skip, and double crochet to create your second space.Continue to ch3, skip, and dc to the second stitch from the end of the round.

, To finish the second round, you will need to chain three more stitches, and then skip a stitch. But instead of double crocheting, you will need to join this chain to the middle of the chain of six you created. Count to the third stitch from the beginning of the chain and slipstitch into this stitch.This completes the second round.

, Begin your third round by chaining four stitches. You will be extending this chain across your existing chain of three and then working the stitches for the cone flower petals onto this chain., Next, insert your hook into the double crochet stitch at the other end of the chain of three. Then, single crochet into this stitch to connect it to the other side., Turn the work around so that the other side is facing you and then chain two stitches.This is also known as a turning chain and it is a common technique in crocheting.The turning chain provides some slack to allow you to continue your work without causing it to pucker., Next, begin to double crochet onto the chain of four. You will need to double crochet six stitches onto this chain. Do not double crochet into the chain. Instead, double crochet into the space between your chain of four and chain of three and go around the chain., When you finish double crocheting six stitches, turn the work again and then double crochet five stitches onto the vertical chain of three from the previous round. This will create the part of the petal that you will fold over and connect to form a cone., After you finish double crocheting five stitches onto the vertical chain of three, cross over to the beginning of your petal and then slipstitch into the first double stitch to connect the ends of the petal. This will form your petal into a cone shape and complete your first flower.Continue to create cone flowers to the end of your project. If you are working in the round, then you will repeat the process of making cone flower petals until you reach the end of the round. If you are edging a crocheted garment, then continue to make cone flower petals on the edges of your project until you achieve your desired result.

Attempt a triple crochet.,
Crochet in the round.,
Experiment with special stitches.",How to Crochet Left Handed1," To crochet left-handed, you will need to hold the hook in your left hand and use your right hand to hold your work. Grip the crochet hook with your left hand so that your thumb and forefinger are gripping the flat part of the hook., Chaining is how you start your foundation for a crochet project and it is the simplest technique in crocheting. Start by looping the yarn over your index finger twice. Then, pull the second loop through the first loop. This will create a slipstitch. Next, slide this loop on your hook and loop the free end of your yarn over the hook. Pull this new yarn through the loop on the hook to make another loop.Continue to yarn over and pull the yarn through to form loops. This will create a chain.
Make the chain as long as it needs to be for your project.
Chaining is often abbreviated as “ch.”

, A slipstitch is also sometimes called a joining stitch. To slipstitch, insert the hook through a stitch, and then yarn over. Pull this new yarn through the stitch to complete the slipstitch.A slipstitch may be used to move from one location to another on your yarn, or it may be used to join two stitches together, such as when you are crocheting in the round.

, A single crochet stitch is another simple stitch that often comes up in patterns. To single crochet, insert the hook through the stitch, yarn over, and then pull this new yarn through the two stitches on the hook. Then, yarn over again and pull the yarn through the two loops on the hook.A single crochet stitch is usually abbreviated as “sc.”

, Double crochet stitches are also quite common. To double crochet, yarn over the hook, then insert the hook through the stitch and yarn over again. Then, pull through the first stitch, and yarn over again. Then, pull through the first two stitches and yarn over again. Pull through the last two stitches to complete the stitch.Double crochet is usually abbreviated as “dc.”

, Half double crochet is not as common, but it is important to know for more advanced work. A half-double crochet stitch is done by yarning over and then inserting the hook into the stitch. Then, yarning over again and pulling through three stitches. Then, yarn over again and pull through three stitches again.Half-double crochet is usually abbreviated as “hdc.”

, A triple crochet stitch is also not as common, but it is important to learn. To do a triple crochet stitch, start by yarning over twice. Then, insert the hook into the stitch and yarn over again. Next, pull the yarn through four loops and yarn over again. Then, pull through two loops and yarn over again. Then, pull through two loops again and yarn over one more time. Then, pull through the last two loops to finish the stitch.A triple crochet stitch is usually abbreviated in patterns with “tr.”

, Crocheting in the round is the same when you are left handed as well. Start by making a chain, and then secure it in a circle with a slipstitch.Then, continue to work your stitches into the chain. You can crochet in the round to create hats, heavy scarves, and cowls., There are many different types of stitches that you can use to create interesting patterns in your crocheted work. Once you feel comfortable with the basic stitches, you can try out some more advanced ones. Some stitches you might like to try include:

Shell stitch
Popcorn stitch
Box stitch

Seek out left-handed tutorials.,
Follow the pattern as usual.,
Take pictures of images and flip them.",How to Crochet Left Handed2," Having reference pictures can be helpful when following pattern or learning a new stitch, but many of the tutorials you will find are made for right-handed crocheters. However, there are lots of left-handed picture and video tutorials available, so seek them out.Check out blogs and videos made by other left handed crocheters.
You might even consider getting yourself a left handed crocheter pattern book.

, Crocheting left-handed does not mean that you can’t use the same patterns as right-handed crocheters. Follow the pattern instructions exactly as they are written. Just use your left hand to crochet the stitches., One of the difficult parts of using tutorials when you are a left-handed crocheter is that the images usually show a right-handed crocheter. One way to change the image into something you can try to do with your left hand is to save the images and then flip them horizontally. This will reverse the image so that it looks like the crocheter is left handed."

;
, Slide the crochet hook under both pieces of yarn from right to left.









Use the hook tip to grab onto a portion of yarn from the working end (ball end) of the yarn.

, Pull the portion of yarn you grabbed through the ring to create another loop on your hook.








Note that this does not count as your first stitch.

, Create as many chain stitches as the pattern calls for.








,, Hold the working end of the yarn taut while gently pulling down on the tail end. As you do this, the stitches should close together at the center, completing your magic ring.

End the round and connect it to the next round, by putting a Slip stitch into the first stitch of the round.

",How to Crochet a Magic Ring2," Instead of creating a single loop, as you would with a standard magic ring, you will need to create two loops. The tail should be in the back on the right side, while the working yarn should be in the front towards your palm.Note that this is very similar to the standard magic ring, but many prefer the double ring for projects that will see a little more action since a double magic ring provides greater durability.
You should wrap the loop around the first two fingers on your non-dominant hand.

, Slide your crochet hook under the two loops of your double ring closest to your fingertips. Grab onto the working end of the yarn and pull it back through to the right, creating a loop on the hook.









Even though you will be creating a double ring, you only need to create a single loop on the crochet hook. The ""double"" portion mainly results from the double loop you made at the beginning of the process. Much of the remaining steps are similar to those you would use for a standard magic ring.

, Grab onto the working end of the yarn and draw it through the loop currently on your hook, creating a single chain stitch.









You will usually need one starting chain for a single stitch pattern, two for a half double pattern, two or three for a double pattern, and four for a triple pattern.

,, Make as many stitches as required for the first round, according to your pattern's instructions.

Chain two and repeat as needed.",How to Cluster Stitch," Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot.


To tie a slip knot:






Create a loop toward the end of your yarn by winding the tail side under the skein side.
Push yarn from the skein side through this loose loop, creating a second loop in the process. Tighten the first loop around the second.
Slide the hook into the second loop. Adjust the width of the second loop so that it is snug around the hook.



, For most projects using the cluster stitch, you will need to create a foundation chain in multiples of three. This is due to the fact that each cluster stitch requires the use of three stitches from the previous row.


The exact number of chains in your foundation will vary depending on the pattern, but if you only want to practice the stitch, a foundation made with 18 to 30 chain stitches should suffice.






Note that the pattern may also call for you to make several rows of stitches off your foundation chain before you reach the row of cluster stitches. In that case, you would work the cluster stitches into the whichever row came directly before it, not into the foundation chain.






To work a chain stitch:






Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook.
Pull this yarn-over through the loop on your hook to complete one chain stitch.



, If you are creating a cluster stitch at the start of a row or round in an established project, you will need to begin the cluster stitch by working two chain stitches from the loop already on your hook.


These two chain stitches act as a turning chain and will be incorporated into the stitch itself. A turning chain is a sequence of chain stitches made at the start of a row to prepare the height of that row for the stitches you intend to use in it.;
, Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front, moving it clockwise around the hook.

, Slide the tip of the hook through the next stitch as indicated in your pattern instructions.


The correct stitch may vary based on the pattern instructions. Usually, though, it will be the third chain or stitch from the hook (including your chain-two turning chain). In other words, work the cluster stitch into the first stitch of the previous row and not into either stitch of your turning chain.

, Catch the yarn with the hooked tip from the back of the project, wrapping the yarn around from back to front. Pull this yarn and the tip of the hook back through to the front of the project.


At this point in the process, there should be three secure loops on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front again. Pull this newest yarn-over through the first two secure loops on your hook.


When finished, you should be left with two more secure loops on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook again, working in a clockwise motion from back to front. Slip the tip of the hook into next consecutive stitch in the pattern.

, Wrap the yarn around your hook from back to front. Pull this yarn-over and the tip of the hook back through to the front of the work.


There should be four secure loops on your hook at the end of this step.

, Wrap the yarn around the hook from back to front. Catch this yarn-over with the hooked tip and pull it through the first two secure loops on your hook.


Afterward, you should have three secure loops on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook once more, moving from back to front again.

, Catch the final yarn-over in the hooked tip and pull it through all three secure loops on your hook.


After doing this step, there will be one new loop on your hook.
When you complete this step, you will have one full cluster stitch.

, To accommodate the width of the cluster stitch, you need to work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook before creating the next cluster stitch.


The exact number of chains can vary depending on the exact pattern, but this is the usual amount. Using a chain-two will usually allow you to place cluster stitches side-by-side in a row.
When completing a row of cluster stitches, you will need to place this chain-stitch bridge in between each cluster stitch.
The only time you would not work any chain stitches in between cluster stitches would be if you intend to create a decrease. If you want the row length to remain unchanged, though, the extra chain is necessary.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook once from back to front. Insert the tip of the hook into the next consecutive stitch in the row.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again. Catch this newest yarn-over and pull it and the hook back through to the front of the work.


You should have three secure loops on your hook at this point.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front. Catch this yarn-over in the hooked tip and pull it through the first two secure loops on your hook.


This should leave you with two secure loops left on your hook.

, Yarn over the hook from back to front again, then insert the tip of the hook into the next stitch in the row.


Make sure that you do not skip any stitches during this step.

, Wrap the yarn around the tip of the hook once, winding it clockwise from back to front. Pull this yarn-over through to the front of your work along with your hook.


There should be four secure loops on your hook at this point.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again. Pull it through the top two secure loops on your hook.


At the end of this step, you should have three secure loops on your hook.

, Yarn over the tip of the hook again and insert the hook into the next stitch of the previous row.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook from the back of the project. Catch this yarn-over with your hook and pull both the hook and yarn back through to the front of your project.


This should give you a total of five secure loops.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again and pull it through the top two secure loops on your hook.


Completing this step should leave you with four loops on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front one last time. Pull this final yarn-over through all four loops on your hook.


When finished, you should have one new loop on your hook to continue your work with.
The completion of this step marks the completion of one cluster stitch.
As noted at the beginning of this section, make sure that you work another two chain stitches after this cluster stitch if you intend to create another cluster stitch beside it.

, Create a standard cluster stitch, but instead of working the cluster stitch across three separate stitches, insert the hook into the same stitch each time you need to make an insertion.


Yarn over the hook once.






Insert the hook through the next stitch or space in your pattern.






Yarn over the hook again, then pull that yarn-over back through to the front of your work. There should be three loops on your hook.






Yarn over the hook and pull that yarn-over through two loops. There should be two loops on your hook.






Yarn over the hook and insert it into the same stitch as before, not the next stitch.






Yarn over from the back and pull it back through to the front, creating four loops.






Wrap the yarn over the hook again and pull it through two loops on your hook, leaving three behind.






Wrap the yarn over the hook once more and pull the yarn over through all three loops left on your hook.






This only completes the first half of your cluster-v stitch.







, Work two chain stitches from the loop on your hook.

, Repeat the process used to create the previous cluster stitch. Instead of moving onto the next stitch, however, you should work this cluster stitch into the same space as your first.


In other words, the entire cluster-v stitch is worked into one space or stitch.
After you finish this second cluster stitch, you have completed one full cluster-v stitch.

, If you plan to create more than one cluster-v stitch, you will need to work two chain stitches in between each cluster-v stitch.


Note that separate cluster-v stitches must be worked into different stitches or gaps. In other words, every sub-stitch in one cluster-v stitch is worked into one space, but every individual cluster-v stitch is worked into a separate space.

Read the project instructions and select the correct yarn weight and hook size.Some instructions will specify a brand name and material for the yarn, but you can choose something else as long as it's the same weight.,
Find the gauge information on the pattern.,
Make a foundation chain about an inch or so longer than the recommended gauge swatch.,
Crochet a square using the pattern's recommended stitch.The pattern will tell you what stitch to use for the gauge.,
Block the square, if necessary.,
Lay your swatch down on a flat surface in a well lit area.,
Mark out a square on your swatch using sewing pins and a tape measure.,
Count the number of stitches and rows in your swatch.,
Compare them to the pattern.,
Change the hook size if the gauge is off.,
Try making your stitches a little looser if you can't get another hook.,
Try a different yarn.,
Create another square and measure again.",How to Check a Crochet Gauge," The weights are typically listed as bulky, worsted, sport, etc. Most yarns will have this written on the label, but sometimes they might have a number that correlates to the weight instead. For example:0: Lace
1: Superfine or Fingering
2: Fine or Sport
3: Light or DK;
, You can find this near the top of the pattern, often just below the yarn and hook recommendations. It will tell you how many rows and stitches there should be within a set of inches/centimeters. It will typically be written as:


Gauge: # stitches and # rows = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters)
# stitches and # rows in single crochet = 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters)

, Making your square larger will help make measuring more accurate later on.For example, if the pattern calls for a 4 by 4-inch ( 10.16 centimeters) gauge swatch, your starter chain should be 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters).

, In most cases, this will be the single crochet stitch, often written as ""scs."" If the pattern calls for something different, such as double crochet, then you should use that instead.


Again, make sure that your square is a little bit larger than what the pattern recommends.

, Some crochet patterns recommend that you steam or block the finished piece. You should treat the gauge piece the same way as you would the finished work. If the pattern says to steam of block the finished project, then you should do the same to the gauge piece.A simple way to block is to place a towel over your swatch, and then iron it using lots of steam. Remove the towel and let the piece cool before moving on., Make sure that you can see your stitches and rows clearly. Also, make sure that the swatch lays smoothly; there should be no bumps or ripples.

, Make sure that the square inside your swatch is the same size as the gauge. For example, if the gauge is 4 by 4 inches ( 10.16 centimeters), then your square should be 4 by 4 inches (10.16 centimeters). You will count your stitches within this square.

, If your stitches are very small, you might find it easier to count them with a pencil or knitting needle. This way, you won't accidentally count two small stitches as one stitch.


Consider writing down the number of stitches and rows on a scrap of paper.

, In order for the gauge to be correct, the number of stitches and rows within that square must match up to the pattern's gauge.If you have too many or too few stitches/rows, then you will need to make some adjustments, and make another square.

, Sometimes, the gauge will be off, even with the correct hook size. This is usually due to working too tightly or too loosely. A quick fix is to simply use a different sized hook. Keep making swatches and changing hook sizes until your gauge matches up with the pattern's.If your swatch has too many stitches and rows, you are crocheting too tightly. Go up a hook size.
If your swatch has not enough stitches and rows, you are crocheting too loosely. Go down a hook size.

, If you are crocheting too tightly, then avoid tugging as much. This will help loosen your stitches. If you are crocheting too loosely, then work tighter by giving the yarn a slight tug after each stitch.

, Some yarns are just thinner than others, despite being the same weight. Other yarns are easier to work with, or ""stretch"" better. Try to use a yarn that is similar to the one in the pattern., Keep making adjustments and squares until your gauge matches the pattern's gauge.

Fasten off the yarn.",How to Crochet a Ring1," Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slip knot, then work enough chain stitches to create a chain long enough to wrap around your finger.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on your ring size. Start checking the length of the chain against your finger after making 11 or 12 stitches, then continue to adjust the length as needed with additional stitches.;
, Join the last stitch of your chain to the first using a slip stitch.

This step creates the basic ring structure. Since the slip stitch does add some length, it's a good idea to check the size of the ring once again before continuing to the next step.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch across the round.

Once you reach the end of the round, join the last stitch to the top of the first stitch using a slip stitch.
Do not turn the work at the end of the round.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into the back loops only of each stitch across the round.

Join the last and first stitch of the round with a slip stitch.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a 1-inch to 2-inch tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Use a tapestry needle to weave the ends of the yarn into the stitches.
This step completes the project, and your ring should be ready to wear.

Crochet the strands until they are secure.,
Continue to crochet.,
Finish your project.",How to Change Colors when Crocheting1," Before you begin crocheting, choose the colors that you would like for your pattern and decide where you want these colors to start. Some patterns may tell you specifically where to change colors, but if you are crocheting without a pattern, simply decide how much of each color you want in your work.


It's best if you decide how many rows and chains you want in your pattern before you start working. For example, if you are making a dish cloth you may want 28 rows with 28 stitches going across. Then, you would need to decide how many rows of each color you want.;
, Take your first color and create your first chain and then your rows of single crochets until you have your desired size of that one color. Follow the steps for basic crocheting to create your pattern. Or, if you are following a specific pattern, create that pattern until you have reached the point where you want to change colors. On the very last stitch, don't complete your single crochet. Stick your hook through your chain, yarn over, and then pull it through to create two loops.









At this point you should have two loops around your hook. Leave these loops on your hook as you switch colors.
These specific instructions are for a single crochet stitch, which is the most basic, common stitch for crocheting. However, the technique used for this stitch can also be used for all types of stitches, so you can follow the instructions and gear them towards the type of stitch you are using.

, Place the yarn you are working with down, with the crochet hook still inside it. Then, take your next color and fold it in half at the end, with five or so inches at the end of the yarn on one side of the fold. Then place your hook through the loop you just created and pull the second yarn color through the two loops on the hook.








Make sure you don't tie a loop in color two. You just want it folded in half so that it can slide through your loops in color one. As you are pulling color two through color one, you might need to hold onto the loose end of it to make sure you don't lose the yarn.

, Now that you have color two attached, cut color one's attached strand of yarn. Leave about four inches, cutting the yarn attached to the skein. Then, pull the strand of yarn left that you just cut to tighten color two in place.








You might need to adjust color two into place by pulling on the end of the yarn with the end of color one. Take the color one yarn still connected to your work. Then, grab hold of the end of color two yarn and pull both strands together. This well help you adjust the yarn so the ends are about the same length.

, Place the yarn under then over your hook and pull it through the loop on your hook. At this point you will start to crochet as usual, single crocheting over loose strands and then continuing to form rows and chains until you have your desired size.








, Taking the color one and color two yarn you just pulled to adjust and tighten your crochet, hold them in the back of your work, near the top of your highest row. Now, turn your work and single crochet over both of those colors. Place your hook through the second chain. Then, grab your working yarn (color two attached to the bulk of the yarn) and place it over the hook. Then, pull color two through the loop.







, As you create your stitches, the single strands of yarn will be crocheted into your work. Continue to create crochet stitches until the yarn feels secure, doing at least six to eight single crochets over the strands. Then, cut the ends of the yarn close to your last single crochet.







, Now you should be solely working with color two. Continue to crochet color two into your work until you have your desired amount. At this point you can switch back to color one, add another color, or continue to crochet with color two. If you are going to switch colors again, just repeat the steps you used to switch from color one to color two. It's that easy!








, After you have your desired size, you'll need to do something with your loose yarn ends. Finish off your last single crochet, pushing the hook through your last stitch, yarning over, and then pulling through the two loops. Then cut your working yarn, leaving four or five inches. Yarn over and pull the yarn with your hook through your last loop. Pull it tight and weave your loose ends through your work.








To weave your loose ends through your work, place your hook through your last stitch, yarn over with your loose yarn, and then pull it through the stitch. Continue to do this through each loop until you have weaved in about half of your yarn. Then, turn and go back the same direction you came, putting your hook through the stitch you just used and weaving your yarn towards the start.

Fasten off the yarn.",How to Crochet a Ring2," Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work one chain stitch from the loop., Work 12 single crochets into the center of the chain you just created.

Join the last single crochet to the top of the first using a slip stitch.
Completing this step should form a tight circle that will act as the foundation round.

, Chain one. Double crochet once into the stitch at the base of chain and the stitch that follows, completing one decrease.

Chain three.
Double crochet once into the next two stitches, completing another decrease. Chain three.

Repeat this pattern across the remaining stitches in the round.


Join the last chain to the top of the first completed double crochet using a slip stitch.

, Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first stitch of this chain. Slip stitch once more into the first chain-three space.

Chain three, then slip stitch once into the first chain.
Slip stitch once into the next double crochet. Chain three, slip stitch once into the first of those chains, then slip stitch once into the next chain-three space. Chain three and slip stitch once into the first of these chains.

Repeat this pattern around the rest of the round.


Join the last stitch of this round with the first using one slip stitch.

, Work a chain long enough to wrap around your finger. Connect the last stitch of this chain to the opposite side of the picot decoration using a slip stitch.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, so you'll need to check the length against your finger before completing the band.
When joining the band to the decoration, slip stitch into the slip-stitch space in between picots on the opposite side of the ring.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess yarn through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Using a tapestry needle, weave the excess ends into the stitches.
This step completes the project; your ring should be ready to wear.

Wrap the bow around the band.",How to Crochet a Ring3," Attach the yarn to the hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches long enough to wrap around your finger.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, but you'll typically need between 12 and 14. Check the length of the chain against your finger before continuing.

, Join the last chain together with the first using a slip stitch.

This will create the base for the ring band. Make sure that the ring fits around your finger before continuing to the next step. Ideally, it should be somewhat snug since the yarn will gradually stretch and loosen.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch across the round. Slip stitch the last single crochet to the top of the first.

Repeat this pattern twice more, creating three rounds made of single crochet.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave the ends beneath the stitches to hide them.
This step only completes the band of the ring. You still need to create and attach the crochet bow.

, Attach new yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work 18 chain stitches from the loop.

Join the last and first chains together with a slip stitch, forming a round.
This foundation round marks the start of the bow decoration.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch across the round. Slip stitch the last stitch to the top of the first.

Repeat this pattern two more times to create a total of three single crochet rounds.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a tail 14 inches (35 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave in the excess yarn at the start of the piece but do not weave in this ending tail.

, Fold the bow piece in half and center it over the band piece. Pull the tail through the band and tightly wrap it around the center of the bow piece, cinching in the middle as you do.

Continue wrapping the bow piece until the bow form is clear and the two separate pieces seem securely joined. You should have roughly 3 inches (8 cm) of yarn left.
Weave the extra tail into the stitches of the ring to hide it.
This step completes the project. The ring is now ready to wear.

The exact number of chains will vary depending on the size of your finger, but you'll usually need between 12 and 17 chains. Periodically check the length of the chain by wrapping it around your finger.

, Join the last chain to the first using a slip stitch.

This should create a round and establish the final size of the ring band. Check the band again by putting it on your finger. Ideally, it should feel just a little loose.

, Chain one, then work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous round.

Slip stitch the last single crochet to the top of the first to even out the round.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of excess. Pull this excess through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Hide the remaining tail by weaving it into your stitches with a tapestry needle.
Note that this step only completes the band of the ring. You need to create the decorative ruffle separately.

, Create a magic adjustable ring using the main yarn color.

This step starts the decorative ruffle for your ring.
To create the magic ring, loop the yarn around your fingers and insert the hook through both overlapping sides of the loop. Grab and pull the yarn through this loop and chain stitch twice.

, Work 24 double crochet into the center of the magic ring.

After working this row of double crochet, pull the yarn ends on either side of the ring to close the circle around its center.
Consider placing a stitch marker in your final double crochet to help you monitor your stitch count for the duration of this project.

, Work six double crochet into each of the double crochet across the previous round.

You'll work a total of 144 double crochet during this step.
The ruffle should take shape by the end of this step.

, Switch to your secondary yarn color, then work one single crochet into each stitch across the previous round.

To change colors, start the stitch and grab the new color with your crochet hook. Pull up a loop with the new color and complete the stitch.
After working the new color into the ruffle, you can cut the main color, leaving 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of excess.

, Cut the yarn, leaving 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) of excess. Pull the extra tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

Weave this tail and all other excess yarn into the stitches of the ruffle using a tapestry needle.
This step completes the ruffle portion of the ring.

, Thread a sewing needle with all-purpose sewing thread. Attach the bottom of the ruffle to the top of the band with a few stitches.

When the ruffle feels secure, knot and cut the thread.
Completing this step completes the project, so the ring is now ready to wear.

Crochet your rows until your desired length.,
Feed the hook through the next loop.,
Pick up your new yarn.,
Crochet as you normally would.",How to Change Colors when Crocheting2," Begin your crochet project as you normally would with one color. Stitch as many rows as you want. Then, when you know where you want to start your next color, stop crocheting. You can start your new color in the very middle of the row, towards the end, or towards the beginning. It's up to you really.

, As you normally would, take your crochet hook and stick it through the next stitch with your color one yarn still on your hook. Then, wrap the yarn you are currently working with around the hook and pull it through the stitch (the first loop on your hook) just as usual. Let go of your yarn.







, On your final yarn over, you will add your new colored yarn. Leaving the loops from your previous yarn on your hook, wrap your second colored yarn around your hook. Then, pull it through the loops already on your hook. After you have pulled it through, tug the new yarn from the back to tighten and adjust it.







, At this point you should be working with your color two yarn. Simply crochet that yarn into your project as your normally would until you reach the point in your project that you want to change colors again. Then, change colors again in the same way.









If you plan to switch back to the first color of yarn you were working with, then ""carry"" your yarn. Do this simply by changing colors in the way described, but keep the strand of your old yarn against the loops you are working with. Then, as you crochet with your new yarn, your old yarn will be carried in your work, because it is up against the loops you are crocheting. When you decide to change back to your previous color, it will already be in your work so the process will be easier."
"
Purchase your supplies.,
Create the first loop in your yarn.,
Insert the crochet hook into the loop.,
Begin the chain.,
Continue creating chains.,
Create your first crochet stitch.,
Pull the yarn through both loops.,
Add another row.,
Repeat these steps until you have finished.",How to Change Colors when Crocheting3," To crochet you simply need a crochet hook and yarn. You can find both of these items at your local craft store or online. The best type of yarn to use when you are first starting out is 100 percent acrylic yarn in worsted weight. The best hook to use when you are first starting out is an aluminum crochet hook in size H (five millimeters). If you are an expert at crocheting, then use the supplies you already own.

, Hold the hook in your right hand and wrap the yarn around your left index finger, placing the yarn over your finger and then looping it around your finger in a clockwise manner. When the yarn reaches the top of your finger again (where you began to wrap it) place it over the loop. Then, place the existing yarn on your finger over that piece of yarn and pull that piece of yarn upwards, pulling it through to form a loop.









Hold your hook in your right hand (even if you are a lefty) and place your thumb and index finger on the flattened part of your crochet hook.

, Insert the hook through the loop, and then take the loose end of your yarn and pull on it, until the loop is pulled tightly around the crochet hook.

, Holding the hook in your right hand, take the yarn and place it over your left index finger. Then, take your thumb and middle finger and place them on the knot of the yarn that is around your hook. Hold that knot to secure it as you crochet. Then, move your crochet hook under then over the yarn in your left hand. Catch the yarn on the hook and pull the yarn through. This creates your first chain.








, In a simple crochet pattern you will create twenty one chains. Continue to repeat the previous step, placing your crochet hook under and then over your yarn. Then, catch the yarn on the hook and pull it through. Do this until you have created 21 chains.









It is important in crocheting that you keep count of your chains. You want your crochet to be even, and if you loose count it may be difficult to continue to crochet the next chains and to keep them the same length.

, After you have created your first set of chains, take your hook and insert it in the second chain next to the hook. Your hook will be at the end of your chains, so don't place it in the chain directly next to it. Insert it into the chain one away from it. Place the head of the hook through the chain, Then, place your working yarn over your hook, and pull the yarn through to form a loop.









This step is called the single crochet. It is helpful to remember this terminology because as you continue to crochet, it will be easier for you to follow the directions. The chains are the first loops that you create, and then from there you will continue to create single crochets until you have your final crochet pattern.

, At this point you should have two loops on your hook. Now, place the yarn over the hook (yarn over), and pull the yarn through both loops. Then, move onto the next chain and do the exact same thing. Stick the head of the hook through the chain, yarn over, and pull it through the chain. Then yarn over and pull the yarn through both loops.









You will do this step until there are a total of 20 single crochets, meaning you have looped your yarn through 20 of the chains.

, Repeat the previous steps until you've completed the entire row of chains. Now, create the next set of chains by placing the working yarn over the hook and pulling it through the loop around your hook. Then, turn your work and skip the first chain. Place the hook through the second chain. Yarn over and pull it through both loops. Continue to do this until you have worked your way down your chains.








, You will do 20 single crochets for each row and then 20 rows. Repeat these steps -- placing the hook through your chain, pulling the yarn through the two loops, continuing down the chain, turning your work and starting again on the next set of chains -- until you have completed 20 rows.


If you mess up, that's okay! Simply, take your hook out of your yarn and begin to pull your yarn to unravel it, until you've reached your mistake. Then, stick your hook back through your yarn and continue to crochet.
If this is your first time crocheting and your work looks like a mess, don't stress. Crocheting is an art that takes practice, so continue to practice until you get the hang of it.

Flip the work over when finished.",How to Crochet a Bobble," Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook from back to front, then insert the hook into the next designated stitch or space in your work.


The appropriate stitch will vary depending on the project pattern you're working with.;
, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook again, then pull the hook and yarn back through to the front of the work.


After completing this step, there should be three secure loops on your hook.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook again. Catch this yarn-over inside the tip of the hook, then pull it through the top two secure loops on the hook.


There should be two loops left on your hook after this. Note that you have also created one half-finished double crochet.

, Wrap the yarn over the hook from back to front again, then insert the tip of the hook into the same stitch or space.


It is absolutely essential that you work each portion of the bobble stitch into the same stitch or space. No part of an individual bobble should be worked into a separate stitch or space.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook, then use the hook to pull that yarn-over back to the front of the work.


There should be four secure loops on your hook at this point.

, Yarn over the hook again and pull that yarn-over through the first two secure loops on your hook.


This should leave you with three loops on your hook. You have also created a total of two half-finished double crochets.

, Wrap the yarn over the tip of the hook and insert it into the same stitch or space one more time.

, Yarn over the hook. Catch the yarn-over in the hooked tip and pull both the hook and yarn back through to the front of the work.


There must be five secure loops on your hook at this point.

, Yarn over the hook and pull that yarn-over through the top two loops on the hook.


At this point, you should have four loops on your hook and three half-finished double crochets. These half-finished double crochets are the three stitches of your “three-stitch” bobble.

, Yarn over the hook one final time. Pull this yarn over through all four loops currently on your hook.


This step finishes the actual bobble stitch itself.You should be left with one loop on your hook. This loop will be used to continue your work but is not included in the stitches of your bobble.

, Work one chain stitch from the loop on your hook. Doing so seals the bobble and prepares your yarn for the next stitch in your pattern.


To make a chain stitch, simple yarn over the hook once and pull the yarn-over through the loop previously on your hook. That completes one chain.

, A four-stitch bobble is created in the exact same way as a three-stitch bobble, except for the fact that one additional half-finished double crochet is created before the bobble is sealed.


Work the basic three-stitch bobble through the point where you have three half-finished double crochets and four loops on your hook.
Instead of closing the remaining loops, work one more half-finished double crochet.

Yarn over the hook.
Insert the hook into the same stitch or space.
Yarn over the hook again, then pull it back through to the front of the work, giving you a total of six loops.
Yarn over and pull it through the first two loops. You should have five loops on your hook and four half-finished double crochet.


After creating the fourth stitch, yarn over and pull the yarn through the remaining loops on your hook, closing off the bobble.
Seal the bobble with a chain stitch to secure it.
Note that the resulting bobble will be bulkier than a three-stitch bobble.

,


Work the four-stitch bobble through the point where you have four half-finished double crochets and five secure loops on your hook.
Do not close off the remaining loops yet. Instead, create one more half-finished double crochet.

Yarn over the hook and insert it into the same space or stitch.
Yarn over the hook again, then draw up a loop by pulling the yarn back to the front side of the work. You should have seven loops on your hook at this point.
Yarn over the hook and pull it through the first two loops. This creates a fifth half-finished double crochet. Note that there should be six loops on your hook.


After creating the fifth stitch, yarn over the hook again. Pull that yarn-over through all six loops on your hook to complete the bobble.
Secure the bobble by working a chain stitch immediately after it.
This bobble will be even bulkier than the four-stitch version. Theoretically, you could create an even thicker bobble by continuing to work half-finished double crochets into the same space, but the five-stitch bobble is usually the largest you would want to use.

, Unless otherwise instructed, you'll usually need to work bobbles into a previously created row of single crochet (or a row made with a similarly simple crochet stitch).


Attach the yarn to your hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation chain with an even number of chain stitches.

Single crochet into the first loop from the hook, then continue to single crochet down the length of the chain. You should end up creating an odd number of single crochets.

, Create three chain stitches at the start of your bobble row, then work the bobble into the first stitch.Note that the chain-three you create counts as your first half-finished double crochet, so you will need to reduce the final number of stitches you actually work for the bobble by one for this first stitch.

In other words, work two half-finished double crochet if the rest of your bobbles will be three-stitch bobbles.
Work three half-finished double crochet when using four-stitch bobbles.
Work four half-finished double crochet when using five-stitch bobbles across the row.


Only this first bobble will be different. The remaining bobbles will have the standard number of half-finished double crochet in them.

, To prevent the bobbles from running together, you will usually need to work one single crochet into the stitch or space immediately following each individual bobble.


This step can vary depending on the project pattern you use, however, so it is best to check the instructions (when applicable).
Continue alternating bobbles and single crochets down the row until you reach the end. The final stitch of your row should be a bobble stitch.

, The row immediately after a bobble row should be a row of single crochet (or another similarly simple stitch).


Make sure that you single crochet once into each bobble and single crochet of your previous row.
If you were to create a row of bobbles directly on top of the first, the bobbles of both rows would be facing opposite sides of the work. In other words, one would face the ""right side"" and the other would be hidden on the ""wrong side."" Creating a row of single crochet in between bobble rows will prevent this from happening.

, The bobbles of your second bobble row should fall out in the spaces between the bobbles of your first.At the start of your second bobble row, chain one, turn, and single crochet into the first stitch.
Work a standard bobble crochet into the next stitch. This should cause the bobble to land in between two bobbles from your previous row.
Continue this pattern down the length of the row.

, You should be able to create as many rows of bobbles as desired by following this pattern.


Simply remember that:

Individual bobbles should be separated by one single crochet.
Bobble rows should be separated by a row of single crochet.
The bobbles of each row should fall in between the bobbles of the previous row.



, The bobbles will actually appear on the back side of your work, so you will need to flip the work over after you've finished creating them.After finishing your bobble rows, you can tie off the work or continue on with other stitches called for in your project pattern.

The exact gauge for this project does not matter.
This demonstration uses a two ounce ball of four-ply, worsted weight yarn and an H/8 or 5.0mm hook. The result is a ball about 5"" in diameter.
The diameter increases more slowly, the more you crochet. Be prepared to use at least one full ball of yarn.;
,,,

The exact number of stitches does not matter much. You may start this project with any start you usually use to crochet in the round, and with any number of stitches that seems comfortable.

, Don't worry if the first ring or two doesn't look like much.

Go ahead and join rounds. There's no need to count stitches in this pattern.

,

The circumference doubles with each subsequent row, because you are crocheting two stitches per stitch. As the circle gets bigger, the circumference gets much bigger.
Add as many rows and as much yarn as you wish. Each subsequent row will take twice as long to crochet, but it will also make the puff curlier.
The puff will become progressively more curly, the longer you crochet. It could go further still, but it will require more and more yarn.

;
, Begin this by looping the working end of your yarn around your hook. Rotate your hook slightly, so the yarn stays on it, and then pull the loop of yarn back through the loop that was already on your hook. You should now have one new loop on your hook.








, You can do this by pulling the extra yarn from the working end of your project.








, Pull out the loose end of the yarn (your working end), leaving one piece of yarn sticking out of the end of your project. This piece should be at least a couple inches long.








,, If you are having a hard time doing this, simply bend the middle of the yarn in half and squeeze it tight. Push the bent area through the eye of the needle.








, Using the needle, pull the yarn back through the middle of the last three stitches you made. Pull the end of the yarn out, so that the needle and yarn are sticking out in the middle of the row, and then stick the needle back into the project. Head back in the other direction with your needle and yarn, inserting the needle one row down and pushing it through the middle of about three stitches. This should lock your yarn tail in place.








, The yarn should stay in place, hidden in the middle of several rows of your stitches.








, Make sure that the end of the yarn is still tucked away neatly and that the tension on the row is that same as the rest of your project. Your project is now finished!

Line up the two needles.,
Knit through the first stitch on both needles.,
Pull the first stitch over the second stitch.,
Pull the last loop and cut to secure the bind off.",How to Work a Three Needle Bind Off1," Before you begin the three needle bind off, line up your two needles. Make sure that both points are facing the same way.To make an invisible seam, the right sides of your knit work should be facing each other.;
, Insert the third needle through the first stitch on both needles. Then, loop the yarn over and pull the yarn through both stitches.Do this once more to create a second stitch. After the first stitch is bound off, you will only need to knit one stitch per sequence., Once you have two new stitches on the third needle, loop the first stitch over the second stitch. Then, knit through two stitches again and bind off another stitch.Continue to repeat the sequence until you have bound off all of the stitches on the needles.

, When you finish binding off all of the stitches, pull the last loop out a few inches and then cut it in the center. Then, pull the loose yarn out of the stitch and pull the tail to secure it.You can also use a darning needle to weave the end into the edge of your knitting project. Then tie te end to a stitch and cut it near the knot.

Insert the needle under the first stitch of the round, moving from outside to inside, then pull your yarn tight.,
Take your needle and pull it back toward the end of your round, inserting it into the middle of your last bound off stitch, the one at the very end of your last row.,
Weave in the tail of your yarn on the inside of your project.",How to Bind Off (Crocheting)2," This will leave you with a gap between the beginning of the round of stitches and the end of that round.








, You should make your loop about eight inches long.








, Pull the working end out of the project, leaving one piece of yarn sticking out of the end of your round. You will end up with four or five inches of tail, which is necessary for you to be able to finish the project.








, If you are having a hard time getting the yarn threaded, bend your piece of yarn over and squeeze the bent area as thin as possible with your thumb and forefinger. Push this thin bent area through the head of the needle. It should go through easier than a raggedy end piece.








, In essence, you are connecting the end of your last round to the beginning of your last round by replicating that same type of stitch.







, Point the end of the needle toward the inside of your project and pull the thread through. This should lock the end of your yarn in place for good.









Try to match the tension that you used in the rest of the project, so that the last stitch you just made does not stand out., Make sure that the end is secure before you clip off any extra tail with your scissors. You should now have an invisible bind off on your circular crochet project!








"
"
Watch your tension.,
Make sure that there are an equal number of stitches on both needles.,
Try a crochet hook.",How to Work a Three Needle Bind Off2," It is important to use the correct tension when you are binding off your stitches. Making your stitches too tight may result in puckering, which will produce a sloppy looking seam.To make it easier to keep the tension slightly loose, use a knitting needle that is a couple of sizes larger than your other two.

, Since each stitch needs to have a match for this bind off method, it is important to ensure that there is an equal number of stitches on both needles.Count the stitches on both needles before you begin.
If all of your stitches are currently on one needle, then slip half of them onto one needle.

, Getting the yarn to go through both of the stitches on both needles can be a little tricky. One option is to use a crochet hook in place of a knitting needle to help make it easier to pull the yarn through both stitches.If you decide to try this, then make sure to use a crochet hook that is slightly larger than your knitting needles. Use the crochet hook the same way as a knitting needle.

, If you're worried about staying on track with a knitting project, consider joining a knitting circle in your area. You can find knitting circles through websites like MeetUp. You can also look for flyers at local craft stores, community centers, and art centers in your area. A knitting circle can be a fun way to connect with other knitters, find new projects, and keep yourself motivated as you knit.

Start with a work in progress.,
Bring the yarn to the front of your project.,
Insert your needle through the front of the project and purl.,
Insert through the back and purl again.,
Repeat the sequence whenever pfb is indicated.",How to Purl Front and Back1," Purling front and back is not something that you would do as a stitch for an entire project. This stitch sequence is usually meant to increase the total number of stitches in a row. Make sure that you have your project in front of you and that you are at the right location where you want to make the increases.
, Whenever you are purling, your working yarn needs to be in front of your project.Take a moment to bring the working yarn strand to the front of your work., To do the purl front part of the stitch sequence, insert your needle in and through the front of the loop. Then, yarn over the stitch and pull through. However, do not allow the old stitch to slide off of the needle as you create a new loop. Leave it where it is for now., To do the second part of the stitch sequence, insert the needle through the back of the loop, yarn over the needle, and pull through. This time allow the old loop to slide off the end of the needle as you create the new loop.This completes one purl front and back sequence.

, It is unlikely that your pattern only calls for a purl front and back stitch one time. You will likely have to do it multiple times in a row or over multiple rows to achieve the desired amount of increases. Look for purl front and back, or pfb, in your pattern and repeat the stitch sequence wherever it is indicated."

Make two single crochets in each previous stitch.,
Alternate between two and one single crochets.,
Complete three rounds of single crochets.,
Single crochet decrease during the next round.,
Stuff the ball.,
Decrease again.,
Do another decrease for the ninth and final round.,
Fasten off the end.",How to Crochet a Ball1," Start by making a slipknot. To make a slipknot, loop the yarn around your index finger two times. Then, pull the first loop over the second loop to make a slipknot and slide the knot onto your crochet hook. Then, chain two stitches., Make six single crochet stitches in the second stitch from the hook, which should also be the first chain stitch you created.To single crochet, insert the hook through the stitch and loop the yarn over the hook. Then, pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook and yarn over again. Then, pull through the remaining two loops on the hook.When done, you should have your first round. This round has six stitches in it.

, Complete your second round by working two single crochets into each single crochet stitch from the previous round.Your second full round should have a total of 12 stitches.

, For your third round, make two single crochets into the first stitch of your previous round, then one single crochet in the second stitch of the previous round. Alternate between one and two single crochets into each stitch all the way around, using every stitch from the previous round.You should make a total of 18 stitches in this round.
This will be your last round of increases.

, For rounds four through six, single crochet once into each stitch of the corresponding previous round.For round four, stitch into round three; for round five, stitch into round four; for round six, stitch into round five.
Each round should have 18 stitches in it.

, Make a single crochet decrease across the first two stitches of your previous round. Afterward, work one single stitch into the stitch that follows. Repeat this all the way around.To do a single crochet decrease, start by inserting the hook through the next stitch in your round and yarn over. Then, pull the yarn through the first loop on your hook and insert the yarn into the next stitch in your round and yarn over again. Pull the yarn through the first stitch again and then yarn over one more time. Pull the yarn through the remaining three stitches on the hook to complete your first single crochet decrease.You should make a total of 12 stitches for this seventh round.
You have reached the halfway point of your ball and are beginning to narrow it back down with this step. Essentially, you will be creating the same rows you had for the first half of the ball, but in reverse.

, It is a good idea to start stuffing the ball before it is too close to being finished or you may have a hard time adding the filling with only a small opening.The ball needs to be stuffed or it will look deflated. You can fill the ball with fiberfill stuffing, dried beans, or plastic bags.


If using something small like dried beans, you may wish to wait until after you complete another round before filling it. If you wait any longer than that, however, the ball might become too difficult to fill at all.

, For the eighth round, make a single crochet decrease over the next two stitches from the previous row. Repeat all the way around.You should complete a total of six stitches.

, Make a single crochet decrease over two stitches of the previous round. Repeat all the way around.


You should only need to make three stitches.

, Cut the yarn, leaving a long tail. Wrap the tail around your hook and pull it through the loop currently on the hook. Then, tie a knot to secure the ball.Weave the loose end into the stitches of the ball to hide it.

Read yarn labels carefully.,
Choose the right sized needles.,
Look into straight, circular, and double-pointed needles.,
Decide on the material of your needles.",How to Start a Knitting Project2," When selecting yarn for your project, make sure you read labels carefully. You want to make sure you're getting high quality yarn that works for your specific project needs.Watch the dye and color numbers. The dyes and colors used in yarn are assigned specific number. The dye number will usually be labeled ""Lot no."" and the color number will usually be labeled ""Color no."" If you need more yarn for a project than is found in a single ball of yarn, make sure you get the same color and the same dye. Even slight differences can become noticeable.
The yarn will also recommend what size knitting needles should be used with it. The pattern you're using usually recommends you use a specific size of of knitting needles. Make sure the yarn you choose is compatible with those size needles.
Pay attention to any advice regarding how to wash this type of yarn. Many types of yarn are not machine washable. You may also notice you cannot use bleach on certain types of yarn. Consider if and how you plan on washing your knitting project in the future. Make sure you choose a yarn that's easily washable if you're making something like a sweater, which will require frequent washing.

, Refer to your knitting pattern when selecting needles. Choose the size recommended. Some patterns may require you switch between needle sizes throughout the project, so you may have to get several different pairs of needles.If you're not using a specific pattern, keep in mind the larger needles make larger, looser stitches while smaller needles make firmer stitches. If you're knitting something like a scarf, you'll get done faster with a smaller needle. However, the stitches may be looser than you would like.

, Depending your project, you'll need a different needle type. Traditional straight needles are used for most beginner projects. However, some projects require circular or double-pointed needles.Straight needles have one pointed end. They're the needles people typically think of when thinking about knitting needles. Things like scarves, baby blankets, and shawls would require straight needles.
Circular needles are two needles with pointed ends joined in the middle with a cord, typically made of plastic. Circular needles are usually required for projects like sweaters, very large blankets, and horizontal scarves.
Double-pointed needles are needles with sharp points at both ends. They're typically used for projects like socks and baby hats.

, If you're buying new needles for this project, consider the material. Most needles are made of wood, plastic, or metal. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type of needle. Take some time deciding on the right needle type for your project before selecting your needles.Wood needles are the most often used in the knitting world, and the easiest on your hands. They're less susceptible to wear and tear. However, wood needles tend to be more expensive. If you're on a budget, consider a cheaper needle.
Metal needles are usually made from aluminum, brass, or nickel. They're more durable than other cheaper options, like plastic needles, but may hurt your hands after longterm use. If you're working with a thicker, rattier type of yarn, metal needles may be your best option as they make for a smoother knitting experience.
Plastic needles are generally considered the worst option, as they tend to be the least durable. However, if you're new to knitting, plastic needles may be a good choice. They are lightweight, causing less hand strain, and tend to be fairly inexpensive.

Roll your yarn into a yarn ball.,
Cast on.,
Begin knitting.,
Knit anywhere you can.,
Set goals.,
Don't get discouraged.",How to Start a Knitting Project3," Usually, when yarn comes out of the package, it is not rolled into a ball. This can make it cumbersome to work with. Before beginning your project, roll your yarn into an easily manageable ball.Take one end of the yarn and wrap it around your middle and index finger. This will be the base of your yarn ball.
Wrap the yarn in a few loops. Continue wrapping the yarn, changing directions with every few wraps. A ball will begin to form. Slide the yarn off of your fingers.
Continue wrapping until all the yarn is in a neat ball. This will be much easier to work with and transport.

, If you're new to knitting, you may not know how to cast on. Casting on means getting your yarn on the needle. Casting on is a fairly simple process, but can be tricky if you're new to knitting. Go slowly. You may have to do a few practice rounds before you cast on successfully.


How you cast on depends on your knitting project. There are different ways you can cast on, and it depends on the types of needles you're using and the project you're creating.
Refer to your specific pattern's instructions for information on how to cast on for that project.

, Follow the knitting pattern instructions and begin knitting. Make sure you refer to your pattern as you go. You may have to add or drop stitches throughout the project, and you may also have to change needle sizes at a certain point.


A project like a scarf may not require a specific pattern. You can simply knit until you feel like your scarf is long enough.
Make sure to count stitches with each new row of a project. You want to make sure you do not accidentally drop or add stitches.

, Take your knitting everywhere. You'll be surprised how quickly your project comes together when you're knitting in your free time. If you take a train to work, bring your knitting with you. Take your knitting to school if you're a student and knit between classes. Knit during downtime at home. Knit while you're watching TV or waiting for dinner to cook.

, If you want to stay on track for a craft project, work on setting goals for yourself. You can decide that you want to finish certain aspects of the project by certain dates. Make notifications for yourself on your calendar, reminding yourself to get your project done in a timely fashion.You can also set small daily goals. For example, you can strive to knit for an hour a night Mondays through Thursdays.

, Knitting can be somewhat discouraging, especially if you're a beginner. The process is slow and it can take a long time to finish a project. There may be times when you find yourself setting a project aside for a few weeks or months. Understand it's normal to get bored with knitting. As knitting is meant to be a fun hobby, don't be too hard on yourself. Allow yourself to work at your own pace and, eventually, you'll complete a project.

Follow your pattern closely.,
Use stitch markers.,
Watch the tension.",How to Purl Front and Back2," Patterns that involve multiple increases and other stitch variations can be a bit harder to follow. Make sure that you pay attention to the differences between rows in the pattern and count your increases to ensure that you are doing the correct amount of pfb stitch sequences., Stitch markers are small plastic rings that you can place on your needles before a stitch to indicate where you need to increase for each round. These can be a great way to simplify your increases and reduce the chances that you will skip one, or do one too many.

If you need to increase by a certain amount in each row or round, then place a stitch marker before the location of each increase to remind yourself.

, Using too much tension can cause purl stitches to pucker, especially when you are working two into the same stitch. However, not enough tension can result in a sloppy appearance. Check the tension on your working yarn as you do your pfb increases to make sure that the tension is not too tight or too loose."
"
Change the size.,
Choose your yarn.,
Try a different stitch.,
Embellish the ball.,
Display or use your ball.",How to Crochet a Ball2," You can make a ball small or large depending on your intentions for using it. To make the ball larger, add a few more rounds of increases by alternating between single crocheting two stitches into one and then one stitch into one.

At the end of each increase round, you should have 1.5 times the number of stitches you had at the beginning of the round. For example, if you start a round with 30 stitches, you should finish it with 45 stitches.
Keep increasing until the ball circumference is the size you want it to be.

, The color and type of yarn you choose can also affect the look and feel of your ball. You can go with a solid color, alternate between two or three colors, or go for a multi-color yarn. You can also choose a smooth yarn like an acrylic, or go with a fluffy yarn to give your ball a furry appearance.

For a striped ball, switch yarn colors after every round for a small ball or after every two rounds for a larger ball.
Be sure the check the gauge of the yarn you are using and make sure that you are using the recommended hook for the yarn type. This information is usually listed on the yarn label.

, You can also experiment with different stitches when making your ball. Trying a different stitch can give your ball some texture and add an interesting design. For example, you could try the popcorn stitch or the crunch stitch for a textured ball.

Keep in mind that tight stitches work best for crocheting a ball because you want to make sure that the stuffing won’t come out. Avoid stitches that have wide gaps in them, unless you plan on lining the ball with fabric.

, After your ball is finished, you can always add embellishments to make it even more unique. Try sewing on a button, tying a ribbon around the middle of the ball, or adding some glittery puffy paint.

For example, you could tie a black satin ribbon around a white ball to add some contrast, or use some glue to add a bit of glitter to the ball and make sparkle.

, Depending on what you had in mind for this project, you have some options when it comes to displaying and using your ball. You can use your ball to play with or you can display it as part of your home décor. Some ways you can use and display a crocheted ball include:

As an ornament. You can loop a piece of yarn or ribbon through the ball to hang it up like an ornament.
In a bowl. Place several balls into a bowl on a table or shelf for a cute DIY décor piece.
Play hacky sack with a bean stuffed ball. If you used beans to stuff your ball, then take it outside and play a game of hacky sack with friends.

Fasten off.",How to Bavarian Crochet2," Attach the yarn to your hook using a slip knot, then work a foundation of chain stitches in multiples of 10.


In other words, the foundation chain can consist of 10 chains, 20 chains, 30 chains, 40 chains, 50 chains, etc.
The length of your foundation chain will be the final length of your project.
At the end of your foundation chain, work two more chain stitches to serve as a turning chain for your next row.

, Half double crochet once into the second chain from your hook.


When counting chains, do not count the loop currently on your hook.

, To create the first shell of your first official row, you will need to work a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.


Skip four chains in your foundation.
Work nine treble crochets into the fifth chain.
Skip another four chains in your foundation.
Half double crochet once into the next chain.

, Repeat the previous step across the full length of your foundation, stopping only once you reach the end of the row.


This completes the first official row.
If desired, you can change yarn colors after the end of your first row. Doing so is not necessary, though.

, Chain three, then work one treble crochet into the front posts of each of the next four stitches. Keep the last loop of each treble crochet on the hook.


After the last treble crochet, yarn over the hook and pull the yarn-over through all the loops on the hook.
Chain four again.
Work one half double crochet into the next stitch in the previous row.

, Work a series of treble clusters, chains, and half double crochets across the entire second row, stopping before you work the last five stitches.


For each group:

Chain four.
Work a front post treble crochet into each of the next four stitches, leaving the last loop on the hook after each one. Half double crochet once, then work another four treble crochets across the next four stitches. Leave the last loop on the hook after each stitch, then yarn over and pull it through the all the loops on your hook after the final stitch. This counts as a nine-stitch shell cluster.
Chain four.
Work one half double crochet into the front post of the next stitch.



, Chain four, then work a treble crochet into the front posts of each of the final five stitches in the row, keeping the last loop on the hook for each one.


Yarn over and pull through all the loops after completing the last one.
This completes the row. Chain four, then turn the work over.

, Work four treble crochets into the top of the first cluster, then half double crochet once into the next half double crochet.


Create connecting shells across the entire row, stopping just before the last cluster. For each connecting shell:

Work nine treble crochets into the center of the next cluster.
Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.


For the final cluster of the row, work five treble crochets into the top of the cluster.
You can change colors at the end of this row or keep going with the color you currently have.
At the end of this row, you should also chain one and turn the work over.

, Work one half double crochet into the first stitch, then work a series of nine-stitch cluster shells across the rest of the row until you reach the end and finish the row.


For each group:

Chain four.
Work a nine-stitch shell cluster over the next nine stitches, following the same procedure used to make the nine-stitch shell clusters in your second row.
Chain four.
Work one half double crochet into the next stitch.


At the very end of the row, chain one and turn the work over.

, At the start of the fifth row, half double crochet into the first half double crochet stitch. Work across the rest of the row using a series of treble crochets and half double crochets.


For each connecting shell:

Work nine treble crochets into the center of the first cluster.
Half double crochet into the next half double crochet.


Continue until you reach the end of the row.
If desired, change colors at the end of this row.

, You've completed a full set of Bavarian crochet at this point. Repeat rows two, three, four, and five until the project reaches your desired width.


If you're changing colors, do so at the end of each odd numbered row.

, When your project is finished, cut the yarn, leaving a tail 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) long. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off and finish the work.


Weave the secured tail into the back of the work to hide it.

Attach your yarn to your crochet hook with a slip knot.,
Crochet a chain of four stitches.,
Make a slip stitch in the first chain you made, forming the four chains you made into a ring.,
Insert your hook into the center of the ring.,
Yarn over your hook.,
Pull the loop back through center of the ring.,
Yarn over once again, and this time, without going through the center of your project, pull the loop you just looped onto your hook, back through both of the strands that are already on your hook.,
Continue making ""Single Crochet"" stitches through the center of the ring.,
Insert your hook through both strands of the first stitch you made in the last round.,
Yarn over your hook and pull the loop through to the front.,
Yarn over your hook again, then pull the working end of the yarn through both loops you had on your hook.,
Make another Single Crochet stitch in the same stitch where you just made the first single crochet of this round.,
Complete the second regular round in much the same way as you completed the first regular round.,
Continue increasing the number of stitches for each round until the project reaches your desired diameter.,
End off your project by cutting the yarn at least 6 inches away from your last stitch, then use the hook to pull this ""tail"" or ""end"" all the way through the very last loop of the very last stitch.",How to Crochet in the Round," Loop the yarn around the pointer and middle fingers of your left hand. Stick your hook through the circle, hooking the working end of your yarn with the hook and then pulling it back through the center of the circle. This will give you one loop on your crochet hook.
, This will form the very center of the circle you are crocheting.









If you are following a pattern you may need to make a different number of chains to start. This will change the number of stitches you make in further steps but will not change the general technique.

, Insert the hook into the loop of the first chain you made. Once through, hook the working end of the yarn onto the hook and then pull it back through the loop and also through the loop that was on your hook.Now the piece is formed into a circle and you have one loop on your hook.








, Be sure that you are going through the very center and not one of the stitches you made.








, To ""yarn over"" means that you need to hook the working end of your yarn onto your hook. Then twist your hook slightly, so that the yarn stays hooked on.







, Two loops should be on the hook after you complete this step.








, This is the finishing step of the basic stitch called a ""Single Crochet"".








, In all you will make eight single crochet stitches around forming a tiny circle for the beginning of your project.








, This will be the first step in creating a connection between the end of the last round to the beginning of it and setting the stage to start another.







, Two loops should now be on the hook.








, This the finishing step of the single crochet stitch which joins everything into a circle. This stitch is also the first single crochet of the next round. (Stitch 1 of 16 total.)








, Now continue around the circle by making two single crochet stitches in each single crochet stitch of the first ring. Doing this is called an ""increase"". This means that there will be 16 stitches when you complete the round. Please count them.









Doing two stitches in each one stitch from the previous round is how we ""increase"" the size of the circle we are making.

, However, this time you will put only one single crochet in the first stitch but then put two single crochet stitches in the next stitch. Do this ""increase"" in every other stitch of the previous round.Repeat this to the end of the round.








, Make one single crochet in the first stitch, then make two single crochets in the next stitch. On the next round do two stitches in every third stitch, then two stitches in every fourth stitch and so on.









See a pattern developing? To keep increasing, put two stitches in the n-th stitch where n is the number of the round you're currently working on. For instance, if you are working on the fourth round, put two stitches in every fourth stitch as you work your way around. You may loop a shot piece of contrasting colored yarn through each round if you wish, to help know which row you are on.

, This is called ""Tie-ing off the end"". Once the yarn is tied off, sew or ""weave"" in the ends. Some patterns use the word ""weave"". To sew or weave in the ends, use a Yarn Needle. Fold the yarn end over the Yarn Needle forming a small tight loop. Slide the yarn needle out of the loop, then insert this tight loop into the eye of the Yarn Needle. Push it through far enough that you can grasp the loop and pull the yarn all the way through the eye. Gently weave the needle tip under and over stitches on the back of your work where it will not show. Do this for a distance of 7 to 8 stitches. Now turn around and alternate. Go over the stitches you previously went under and visa-versa. Now turn it around and do it a third time, this will make the ""tail"" or ""yarn-end"" stay put for many years. Remember to sew in both ""tails"" on the outside edge and in the very center.

Add more squares and rows as needed.",How to Attach Granny Squares1," Place two granny squares together, one on top of the other, with the ride sides facing together.This method will create a secure seam that is strong enough to hold together large pieces.;
, Make a slipknot on one end of the yarn and squeeze your crochet hook into the loop.



Make a slip knot by creating two loops side by side. Push one loop through the other and pull, forming a single loop with an adjustable knot.

, Slide your crochet hook through the back loops of both squares on the upper right side. Grab the yarn from the other side and pull it through to form a second loop of your joining yarn.


Note that the first loop on your joining yarn, at this point, is the loop you created with your slipknot. This loop now sits over the crochet hook.

, Use your hook to maneuver this new, second loop through the first loop originally on your hook. This will create the first slip stitch of your joining chain.

, Weave your crochet hook through the remaining back loops of the entire top edge, forming slip stitches for each back loop.


Do not crochet too tightly. Doing so will make the seam too tight, and your finished product will not be very flexible as a result.

, You can attach more squares to your originally two squares using this same method around the other edges. Expand the blanket, scarf, or other project outward by adding one square at a time.


Finish the piece with a border or by weaving the end back into the final seam to hide it while keeping the joined row secure.

Make sure that your yarn and hook match up.,
Use a smooth yarn type and avoid fluffy yarns.",How to Crochet a Shell Stitch," To begin your foundation for the shell stitch, you will need to make a chain. Your chain will need to be a multiple of six plus five additional stitches.For example, you could make a chain of 18 plus five, which would be 23. This would be a great length for practicing the stitch. Or, for a wider piece, you could make a chain of 60 plus five, which would be 65.
To chain, loop the yarn over your hook two times, then pull the first loop through the second one. Then, loop your yarn over the hook again and pull it through the loop. Keep doing this until your chain is the required length.;
, Begin your first row by working a single crochet stitch into the second chain from your hook.To single crochet, insert the crochet hook into the chain and then loop your yarn over the hook. Pull your yarn through the stitch to create a new loop. Then, yarn over again and pull the loop through both of the loops on the hook to complete a single crochet stitch., Skip the next two stitches and then double crochet five times into the third stitch. This will cause the stitches to fan out and create your first shell stitch.To double crochet, loop your yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook into the chain. Loop the yarn over again. Then, pull through the first stitch, and loop the yarn over the hook again. Next, pull the yarn through the next two stitches on your hook, and then loop the yarn over again. Pull this yarn through the last two stitches on your hook., After you finish your fifth double crochet stitch, skip two chains and then single crochet into the third stitch one time. You will need to do this after you finish each shell., Continue to skip two, double crochet five times into the same stitch, skip two again, and then single crochet. Do this all the way across the row until you reach the last three chains., Skip to the last chain in the row and then double crochet three times. This will finish your first row., Your first row always needs to begin with a turning chain. This is a small chain that will provide some slack for your new row to begin. Always start your rows with a chain of one., Your first stitch will need to be worked into the top of the first double crochet stitch from the first row. Locate this stitch and then single crochet into it one time., To make your first shell, you will need to locate the next single crochet stitch and then double crochet five times into it. This will create a shell in the curved space between your first two shells., After you finish your first shell for the row, skip two stitches and then single crochet into the next double crochet stitch., Continue to repeat the sequence of skipping over to the next single crochet stitch, double crocheting into it five times, skipping two, and then single crocheting. Keep doing this until you only have three stitches left., In your last stitch for the second row, double crochet into the stitch three times to make a half-shell. This will complete your second row., To continue working in the shell stitch, you will just have to repeat the second row. Keep repeating the row until your project is the size that you want it to be., Whenever you start a new row, you may also wish to switch colors. This will help to ensure that your shells stand out. However, you can also stick with one color if you like and your shell pattern will be a bit more subtle., It is important to use a hook that is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. If you do not, then your project may not turn out right. Always check the yarn label to see what hook size is recommended for the yarn.

If you are using a pattern, then it is always a good idea to follow the recommendations for yarn type and hook size. Otherwise, your finished product might not look how it is supposed to look.

, The shell stitch works best when you use a straight, smooth yarn. Fluffy or textured yarns may not result in a distinct shell pattern. Steer clear of these types of yarns and opt for a straight, smooth yarn instead."

Lay rows next to each other.,
Double crochet rows together.,
Make one granny row around the finished piece.",How to Attach Granny Squares2," The second square should be on top, and the back sides of both squares should be facing each other.


Note that if you have a layout or pattern in mind, you should arrange it before you crochet your rows together.
Stack the first row together. The last square in that row should go on the bottom and the first should go on top. Smaller stacks are easier to work with.
This method will create a flexible, decorative seam between the squares.

, Make a slipknot on one end of the yarn and squeeze your crochet hook into the loop created by the knot.



Make a slip knot by creating two loops side by side. Push one loop through the other and gently pull them in opposite directions, forming a single loop with an easy-to-adjust knot.

, Make a slipknot over the open corner of your top granny square. Chain stitch three times off this corner.

, Connect the bottom square to the top square by making three double stitches (double crochets) in the open corner of the bottom square.


You might need to change the way you hold the two squares together as you stitch them together. If you have trouble stitching them together with one on top of the other, turn the two squares on the side so that the shared edges are facing up toward you. The ""top"" square will now be on your right and the ""bottom"" will be on the left.

, Make three double crochet stitches in the next open space of the top/right square. After those are complete, make another three double crochet stitches in the next open space of the bottom/left square.


Continue across the shared sides of the two squares using this technique. Alternate back and forth, making sets of three double-stitches in each open space along the edges of both squares.

, When you reach the end of the joined row, make one double stitch crochet in the final open corner.


Bind or knot it off to finish the joint.

, Follow the same same procedure to stitch together all the squares in each row.


Also repeat the procedure for each stack (or row) of granny squares.

, Work with two rows at a time. Place the rows together with the backs facing each other.


The principle for joining the rows together is essentially the same principle used for joining individual squares.

, Follow the same pattern you used when joining the individual squares. Make three chain stitches in the corner of the front row, followed by three double stitches in the corner of the back row.


Make sets of three double-stitches, alternating back and forth between the open spaces of the two rows until you reach the end.
The join between two squares should be treated as any other open space, and you should make three double stitches there, too.

, Once all the squares and rows have been joined together, make sets of three double-stitches all around the perimeter of the piece to finish it and even out the edges.

Match up the granny squares.,
Thread your needle.,
Start at the upper right corner.,
Weave the yarn through each back loop on one side.,
Add more squares as needed.",How to Attach Granny Squares3," Place two granny squares on top of each other with the right sides facing together.


This method is quick and easy, and as long as you keep the stitches fairly loose, it makes the seam very flexible and soft.

, Thread a large darning needle with yarn. Insert one end of the yarn through the eye of the needle and pull enough of it through to prevent the needle from becoming un-threaded during the joining process.


You do not need to knot the yarn, but you may do so if you have difficulty keeping the yarn on the needle. Knot the short end of the yarn to the opposite side of the yarn, just past the portion which passes through the eye of the needle.

, Pull the thread through the the back loop in both the top and bottom squares.


Do not pull the yarn all the way through since there is no knot on the end of the yarn to hold it in place.
Leave enough yarn at the end after pulling the rest through to either knot or use in attaching another square, depending on whether this square is on the end of a row or in the middle, respectively.

, Bring the needle over the edge of both squares and into the next back loop of the top square. Push it through the loops of both the top and back squares once more.


Repeat this with the next set of back loops. You are essentially sewing the squares together using a whip stitch, or a type of stitch that stitches over the edge of the material rather than before the edge.
Continue sewing this top edge of the two squares together to connect them together.

, After the two squares have been joined together, you can use the same technique to join squares to the other sides of the same two squares. Expand your squares out in whichever direction you need to in order to add rows in both directions.


Knot the yarn to the back edge of the final square once you have finished stitching them together.

Line up the squares.,
Thread your needle.,
Weave your needle into the bottom left edge of the first square.,
Weave your needle into the bottom right edge of the second square.,
Repeat along one edge.,
Tighten the joining stitch.,
Repeat with the next two squares.,
Attach additional squares horizontally or in vertical pairs.",How to Attach Granny Squares4," To start with, you should line up two of your squares side by side. These will be the squares you join first.It might be a wise idea to lay out all your squares first, however, so that you can see how everything will flow together.
All the squares should be lined up with the right side facing up.
It is also recommended that you start with the bottom pair of squares in the middle row of your overall project.
This method will create another flexible joining seam, but unlike the whip stitch, this stitch will be hidden from both sides of the finished project.

, Thread a large darning needle with yarn. Insert one end of the yarn through the eye of the needle and pull enough of it through to prevent the needle from becoming un-threaded during the joining process.


Do not knot the yarn at this point in time.
Use yarn that is slightly thinner than the yarn you used to make your granny squares.

, Pick up the right-hand square of your first pair. Slide the needle up and through the bar on the edge of the square in the bottom left side of that square.


The ""bar"" refers to the connecting thread lying between the front and back pieces of yarn of the square. This bar can only be seen from the side of the square.

, Pick up the square that goes to the direct left of the first square in your sequence. Weave the needle up and through the bar on the bottom right side of this square.

Do not tighten the two squares together yet.

, Weave the needle up and through the next bar along the shared edge of the first square. Then, weave it up and through the next bar along the shared edge of the second square.


Continue sewing through the bars on both edges to connect the two squares together along one shared edge.
Leave the stitches loose as you sew initially to make the process easier.

, Grab both hanging ends of the joining yarn. One should hang from the bottom and the other should hang off the top. Pull the top end up and the bottom end down to tighten the seam and draw the two squares closer together.


With this step, the seam should become ""invisible"" or hidden in between the two squares.

, Grab the next two squares in your sequence and repeat the same procedure to join them together.


The next pair should connect to the top of the first pair.
Use the yarn hanging off the top of the first pair to join the second pair together. Doing so will also connect the second pair to the first.

, When expanding the piece vertically, you need to do so in pairs, as you did when connecting the second pair to the first. When expanding the piece horizontally, you can do so by attaching a single square to the empty left or right side of the original square using another invisible stitch.

When done, knot the yarn to the back edge of the final square.

You can identify the loops by laying your work flat and looking at the bumps along the top edge where you are working. Your hook should be going in the front and out the back of the loop.;
, Hook the yarn so that the yarn is facing you.








, Pull the yarn back through the loop. You should now see two loops of yarn on your hook.








, Hook the yarn so that the yarn is facing you again.








, Pull the yarn back through the two loops on your hook. You may need to turn the face of your hook down towards your piece. When you are done you should be left with a single loop again.








, For the next stitch, avoid the loop which is pulled upward into your current stitch. Go for the next loop instead.








, If you are starting a piece from scratch, you'll have to make a chain before you can single crochet. First, you'll want to chain the number of single-crochet stitches you'd like to create, plus one or two, depending on which stitch you will be using in the next row. Figure out how many you need and continue.

, To crochet chain stitches, first tie a slip knot and poke the crochet hook through the knot.

, Hold the crochet hook in one hand, and the end of the yarn that leads back to the skein in the other.

, Wrap the end of the yarn around the hook once, starting behind the hook and coming up and over until the yarn lies beneath the hook itself.

, Pull the hook through the slip knot, drawing the yarn you just wrapped along with it. You've just chained 1 stitch and have a new loop of yarn around the hook for making your next chain.








, Repeat the process, wrapping the yarn around the hook and pulling it through the loop until you've chained the desired number of stitches.








, Turn your work. Once you've done your chain row, or a row of single crochet, you'll have to turn around and do another row. In other words, hold the hook still while you flip the chain you just made from either right to left, or left to right.








, Identify the second chain stitch away from your crochet hook. In other words, skip the chain stitch and go on to the first single crochet stitch.








, Poke the hook through the top of this stitch, from front to back. Continue as described in the first section.








, At the end of each row, always chain 1 more stitch, turn your work, and repeat the process back across the row.

;
, Take the ""working yarn,"" or yarn leading back to the skein, and wrap it over your crochet hook, from the back toward you. Ensure this new loop of yarn sits inside the hook itself, with your slipknot loop a little farther away.










When a pattern wants you to yarn over, it will abbreviate it as ""yo.""

, Pull your hook backward through the slipknot loop, bringing the second loop with it. You should now have two chain stitches, with one loop remaining on your hook.









, Yarn over and draw through until you have the amount of stitches you need. If working from a pattern, count your stitches and stop when you have the number called for. If working on the fly, simply estimate.









, After you have reached your required length of foundation chain, you must crochet exactly three more stitches to help you turn your work and start the treble crochet.








, Keeping your last loop firmly on your hook, simply take the work that you have done and flip it so that the end you started from is trailing to the opposite side. Do not move or flip your hook.









, Wrap your yarn over your hook from the back toward you two times.









, Count four stitches back from your hook. You will skip all of these. Insert your hook under the top loop of the fifth chain stitch from your hook. This is done because those four stitches count as your first treble crochet stitch.









, Wrap your yarn over the hook from back to front exactly as before and pull it through one of the loops on your hook.









, Wrap your yarn over the hook once and pull it through two of the loops on your hook.

",How to Crochet a Granny Square," Yarn, of course, comes in a wide variety of colors. Which colors you choose vastly changes how your final blanket, pillow, or other creation will look. Carefully choose your colors to get the effect you want.


Get the ""gypsy"" look by pairing red, dark purple, pink, yellow, bright blue and spring green.
Get the ""old country"" look by making bright squares but putting them together with a black border.
Get a classic American look by combining, white, red, blue, and pale yellow.
If you don't want the granny square look but you want to still use the method to get a fast blanket, use only two colors (white and blue, for example) to create a more subtle look.;
, Once you know your colors, you'll want to pick out a good yarn in the best material for you. If you're making a blanket for a baby, use the softest yarn possible. If making something more durable, such as a pet-bed cover, use acrylic.

, The size of the hook should always be stated in the pattern you want to use or listed for the weight of yarn you purchased.


If you're worried about the hook size, do a test patch with a few rows of double crochet.

, Form a slip knot around the hook, wrap yarn around the hook, and pull it through the loop in the knot--this is one chain stitch. After the yarn you pulled is wrapped around the hook, pull another loop through that, making a second chain stitch. Be sure to leave at least 4 inches (10.2 cm) of yarn at the beginning in case you need it later.








, This forms a ring. Pull a new loop through the loop already on the hook, as well as through the chain stitch.








, This is the same as if you were doing rows of double crochet stitch.








, Make two double crochet into the center of the ring.








, Chain two then make three double crochet into the center of the ring. Do this 3 times, for a total of 4 groups of 3 dc (double crochet).








, Slip stitch into the top of the three chain to finish the round.








, Add a new color for the next row if you like. Simply start crocheting with the new color from any ch-sp (chain space, the gaps left by the chain stitches between the bunches of double crochet).

, Again, this is the same as if you were doing rows of double crochet stitch.








, In the chain space described above, do 3 double crochet stitches (but don't forget that in your first set, the first dc is really the chain three that you did already).








, Chain two over the double crochet bunch and then make three more double crochet stitches into the next chain space. This begins to create the square.








, Make 3 chain stitches to form the corner of the square and then double crochet 3 more into the same chain space.









Change to 1 chain stitch between if you want a rounder, tighter square as shown in the pictures.

, Do all 4 corners, and then slip stitch to the top of the ch-3 in the first corner to finish the round. Each corner should have two sets of three dc, each separated by three chain stitches.








, Change colors again if you like.

, Double crochet 2 bunches of three stitches (separated by three chain stitches) into each corner. Do only ONE bunch of three dc into each ""flat side"" chain space, with two chain stitches between the corner bunches and the middle bunches.








, The number of side spaces will continue to increase.









You can make a potholder by backing your square with sturdy cloth, make an ornamental doily by using a thinner yarn, or even a baby blanket by using soft yarn in baby-friendly colors. You can make an afghan by either making one huge square or by attaching a number of small squares together.
Squares can be attached by sewing or by crocheting together using slip stitch or single crochet.

With your right palm up, begin with the yarn lying across the fingers of your right hand, the end held by your thumb.,
Holding the crossed threads between your right thumb and forefinger to make a circle, make a loop of yarn with the ball end yarn and pull that loop up through the circle.

,
Holding the knot, insert your crochet hook through the top of the loop and tighten by pulling the short end of the yarn.,

Continue crocheting.",How to Crochet Right Handed," Wrap the yarn under your fingertips and back across the fingers until it crosses itself.;
,, You should have made a slipknot.

, Palm down, put your right hand under the end of the yarn going to the ball, forefinger about 2 inches (5 cm) from the hook. Wind your pinkie finger over and then under the ball yarn. This should provide the tension that you need to achieve good even stitches. Pinch the knot under the hook with your thumb and middle finger raising your forefinger slightly to aid the tensioning, pick up the hook with your left hand like you would hold a pencil. You are ready to crochet.

, Catch the yarn with your hook and pull it up through the slipknot loop that was on the hook. This is called a chain stitch (usually abbreviated as ch in instruction pamphlets). Repeat this 10 times (total of ch 11 plus the loop on your hook).

, Insert hook into the top of the loop of the second chain from the hook. Draw the yarn loop through both the chain and the loop on the hook. Insert the hook into the top of the next chain, draw the yarn loop through both the chain and the loop on the hook. Continue this way to the end of the chain. You should have made 10 slip-stitches.

, Ch 1 turn work. You are looking at the back of the work. Insert the hook into the top loop of the last slip-stitch made. Draw up a loop only through the slip-stitch. Draw a second loop through both the loops on the hook. Repeat 9 more times. You have made a row of 10 SC stitches.

, Ch 2 turn work. Swing the hook to the right, under, and up to the right of the yarn. Insert hook into top of last single crochet worked and draw up loop (three loops on hook). Draw another loop through two ( two loops on hook). Draw another loop through those two (on the loop on the hook). You have made 1 double crochet. Repeat across work (10 DC stitches).

, All crochet is based on these basic stitches or variations of them.

Create a slipknot.,
Cast on four stitches normally.,
Bind off two stitches.,
Repeat the process.",How to Picot Cast on1," Start by making a slipknot in your yarn about six to eight inches from the end. To do this, make a loop in your yarn, and then pull a second loop through the first one.Then, slide the slipknot onto your main needle. This is the needle that you hold in your left hand.Tug the end of the working yarn to tighten the loop.;
, Next, use the regular knit cast on method to cast on four stitches. To do this, insert your working (right hand) needle into the slipknot, yarn over, and then pull through and slide the slipknot off the needle as you do so. Then, loop the yarn over your main needle and insert the working needle through the loop. Yarn over and pull through again to create another stitch.Continue casting on with the regular knit method until you have four stitches total on your right hand needle.

, Once you have five stitches on your working needle, you will need to bind off two of them. First, place the needle with the stitches on it into your opposite hand. Then, knit into the first stitch. Next, insert the main needle into the first stitch on the working needle and loop it over the second stitch. This completes your first bind off stitch.Bind off a second stitch by knitting one and then binding off in the same manner as the first.
Return the last stitch to the main needle after you finish binding off two stitches.

, To repeat the process, cast on four stitches again, and bind off two stitches. Keep going until you have the desired number of picot stitches on your needle."

To do this, loop the yarn around the needle or around your finger twice and pull one loop over the other. The, slide the loop onto the main (left hand) needle., Insert your right hand needle into the yarn as if you are going to knit it. Then, loop the working yarn over the end of the needle and pull it through the slipknot, but don’t slide the slipknot off the needle., Pull out the yarn with your working needle to provide some slack and then turn the loop around and slide it onto the main needle. Then, tighten the loop by tugging on the working yarn. Now, you should have two stitches on your main needle., Next, position the yarn as if you are going to purl. This means that the yarn should be in front of the needle instead of behind it. Then, insert your working needle into the first stitch on the main needle purlwise, as if you are going to purl the stitch, and slide it onto your working needle and off of the main needle., Loop the yarn over your working needle to the right of the stitch you just transferred to the working needle. Then, knit into the stitch that is on your main needle. By doing this, you should end up with two more stitches on your working needle., Next, you will need to bind off a stitch. To do this, insert your main needle into the center stitch on your working needle. Then, pull the loop over the stitch to the left (nearest the tip of the needle)., Continue to insert the needle purlwise, knit a stitch, and bind off a stitch. Keep continuing this pattern until your chain is the desired length. Then, you can transfer the chain over to your main needle and knit as normal., To transfer the chain, insert the needle into the first loop on the chain. Then, yarn over and pull through to work the chain onto the needle.

Cast on two stitches.,
Knit two stitches.,
Bind off one stitch.,
Knit one and bind off one.,
Slip the working stitch back onto the main needle.,
Repeat the process.",How to Picot Cast Off1," Start by casting on two stitches how you normally would. To cast on, insert the working needle (right hand) in between the first two stitches on the main needle (left hand). Then, yarn over and pull this loop through the two stitches. Then, turn this loop and slide it onto the main needle.Repeat one time to cast on your second stitch.;
, Next, knit into the two stitches that you just cast onto the main needle. Knit these stitches as you normally would. To knit, insert the needle through the first loop, yarn over, and pull through the loop. As you do so, allow the old loop to slide off the main needle and the new loop to replace it on your working needle., Bind off one of the stitches you just knit. To bind off, simply pull the second stitch over the first stitch on the needle. Pull the second stitch over the end of the needle to complete the bind off. , Knit another stitch and then bind off one stitch again. Doing this multiple times will form your picots.Repeat the process of knitting one and binding off one stitch until you have bound off a total of four stitches.
This will complete your first picot.

, After your third bind off, transfer the leftover stitch back over to the main needle. This will allow you to repeat the process and keep making picots., Continue to repeat the entire process from cast on to slipping the leftover stitch back to the main needle. Keep doing this until you have bound off all of the stitches for your project."
"
Add beads.,
Change the size of the picots.,
Use a different yarn color or type for the edging.",How to Picot Cast Off2," If you want to make your finished project even fancier, then try adding beads. You can thread a bead onto one or more of your knit stitches as you bind off. To do this, carefully slide the knit stitch loop off of the needle and then thread a bead over the whole loop. Then, slide the whole loop back onto the needle with the bead below the needle and bind off the stitch.Make sure the bead openings are large enough to easily thread onto the yarn loops.

, You can also make your picots smaller or larger if desired. To make picots smaller, knit and bind off fewer stitches per picot. To make picots larger, knit and bind off more stitches per picot.For example, instead of binding off four stitches per picot, you could bind off two stitches per picot for smaller picots, or six stitches per picot for larger picots.

, It is perfectly fine to use the same color yarn as you used for your project, but you can also use a different color or texture of yarn to provide some contrast and/or texture to the edging.For example, you could contrast a blue blanket with some white yarn for the edging, or choose a yarn that has a fluffy texture.

Repeat the sequence to the end of the first row.,
Knit the second row.,
Repeat the sequence of rows until your project is finished.",How to Knit the Rice Stitch1," To get started, you will need to cast on a multiple of two plus one stitches.For example, you could cast on 20 stitches and then add one more for a total of 21 stitches.
Count your stitches as you cast on to be sure.;
, After you finish casting on your stitches, you can begin working the first row. The first row starts with a purl stitch.To purl, insert the needle into the stitch going towards the front so that the left needle ends up in front of the right needle. Then, loop the yarn over and pull through. As you pull through, slide the stitch off of the left needle and allow the new stitch to slide onto the right needle., Follow the purl stitch with a knit stitch. However, work this stitch into the back loop of the stitch.To knit, insert the right needle towards the back of your work going through the back loop of the stitch. Then, yarn over and pull through the loop. Let the stitch slide off of the left needle and the new stitch to slide onto the right needle., Continue to alternate between purling one stitch and knitting one stitch all the way to the end of the row., Your second row will be all knit stitches. Knit all of the stitches in this row as usual. You will repeat this for every even row., After you have completed your second row, return to the pattern for the first row. Then, repeat row two again.Continue repeating rows one and two until your project is finished.

Make a washcloth.,
Knit a baby blanket.,
Create a scarf.",How to Knit the Rice Stitch2," The rice stitch is ideal for washcloths because of its rough texture. Try making a washcloth with the rice stitch using 100% cotton yarn.You will need to check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches to cast on. This number will vary depending on the thickness of your yarn. For example, if you are using a medium weight yarn, then you may need to cast on 25 stitches for a washcloth. However, if you are using a chunky yarn, then you may only need to cast on 11 stitches.

, The rice stitch also makes a cute baby blanket. Try using some baby blanket yarn to make a baby blanket for your own baby or as a gift for someone.If you are using a lightweight yarn and a pair of size 8 (5mm) needles, then cast on 163 stitches. Then, begin working in the rice stitch until your blanket is complete.

, The rice stitch also creates an interesting pattern that looks great as a scarf. Try making a scarf for yourself or for a friend.

Keep in mind that the number of stitches you need to cast on will depend on your yarn type and needles. For example, if you are using chunky yarn, then you can cast on 24 stitches using a pair of size 11 needles. Then, work the rice stitch until your scarf is the desired length."

Check your yarn to see what type it is.,
Cast on.,
Use the slots to knit or knit as usual.,
Bind off as usual.",How to Knit Ribbons1," There are two basic types of ribbon yarn: the slotted kind and the regular kind. Both types of yarn require some delicate maneuvering and special techniques.The slotted kind of ribbon yarn has edging that is made up of rectangular slots made from string. If you are working with this type of ribbon yarn, then you will be knitting into the slots only and not using the entire ribbon.
The regular type of ribbon yarn just looks like a long length of ribbon. To work with this yarn, you can knit it as usual.;
, Casting on with slotted ribbon yarn is much easier than casting on with normal yarn If your ribbon yarn is slotted, then you will cast on by inserting your needle into every other slot. You do not need to do anything else to cast on with slotted ribbon yarn.If your yarn is not slotted, then you will need to cast on in the usual way for knitting.

, Use the first slot to knit your first stitch for the row and then skip a slot after every stitch. Knitting into every other slot will help to ensure that your finished project has a ruffled look to it.If your ribbon yarn does not have slots, then just knit with it as usual. However, you may want to double wrap your yarn around the needle for your stitches in every other row. Then, unfurl the yarn in the next row to enhance the ribbon-effect of the yarn., Binding off or casting off with ribbon yarn is about the same as binding off with regular yarn. You start by knitting two stitches, and then pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Then knit another stitch, and pull the first stitch over the second stitch again. Repeat this process until you have cast off all of your stitches.Keep in mind that if your ribbon yarn is slotted, then you will be using the slots. If the ribbon yarn is not slotted, then you will just be casting off with the ribbon.

"
Go with a larger needle size.,
Untwist your yarn occasionally.,
Transfer your yarn to a yarn cone to help keep it flat.,
Cut out any knots you encounter.",How to Knit Ribbons2," Using a larger needle size will help to ensure that your design retains the ribbon look after you have finished knitting it. Small needles will make ribbon yarn seem more like regular yarn.You should always check your yarn’s label to see what needle size is recommended, but if you are not sure, then try a pair of size 11 needles.
Opt for plastic or wood needles rather than metal needles when working with ribbon yarn., Yarn can get twisted while you work with it. If this happens with ribbon yarn, then it won’t look like ribbon anymore. Check your yarn after each row to make sure it has not gotten twisted. If it has, then stop knitting for a moment and untwist it.Push your stitches back on the needle to ensure that they will not come off the needle while you are untwisting your working yarn.

, Wrapping your yarn around a yarn cone will help to ensure that the yarn stays flat as you work with it and reduce the need to constantly check it for twisting. Unfurl your yarn, and then begin wrapping it around the cone. Keep the yarn flat as your wrap it around the cone.If you don’t have a yarn cone, then use an empty paper towel roll.

, You may come across a knot or two when you are working with slotted ribbon yarn. This is due to the manufacturing process, but you do not want to incorporate these knots in your work because they will stand out. Instead, cut out the knot and then continue knitting. When you near the end of the ribbon, put the slot of the new yarn onto your hook and knit as usual."

Make a scarf.,
Knit a cowl or infinity scarf.,
Create a ribbon beanie.",How to Knit Ribbons3," Scarves are the best way to use slotted ribbon yarn because the ruffles will be on display. Try making a scarf from slotted ribbon yarn to create a luxurious looking scarf for yourself or for a friend.

Keep in mind that your scarf will look narrower after it is finished than while you are making it.

, If you want a ruffled scarf that you won’t have to wrap up or worry about tying, then an infinity scarf is a great choice. These types of scarves slip right over your head and hang elegantly. Try making an infinity scarf for a different way to use your ribbon yarn., If you want to wear ribbons on your head, then try your hand at making a ribbon beanie. You can follow a normal pattern and either use slotted ribbon yarn or regular ribbon yarn to create a ribbon beanie.

Keep in mind that if you use slotted ribbon yarn, then it will look like a ruffled hat. If you use non-slotted ribbon yarn, then it will look more like a normal hat.

Repeat the sequence.",How to Moebius Cast on1," A Moebius cast on requires the same basic items as normal knitting in the round. You will need to have a pair of circular needles that measure at least 32”. You will also need a ball of yarn.Make sure that your needle size is appropriate for the type of yarn you are using. Check the yarn label to find the recommended needle size.;
, To start your Moebius cast on, you will need to make a slipknot. You can easily do this by making two loops and pulling one loop through the other.Slide the slipknot onto the needle, and then tug on the tail of the working yarn to tighten the slipknot. Move the slipknot so that it is on the wire., Next, you will need to make a loop in the wire of your circular needles. They should have a natural loop in them, so you can let them go into this shape. When the wire is in a loop, align the needles so that they are right alongside the edges of the loop., With your circular needle wire in a loop, cast one stitch onto your needle so that it is parallel with the slipknot you cast onto your wire., Next, you will need to cast a stitch onto the wire. To do this, take your right needle and bring it into the wire circle and then under the circle to the other side. Then, yarn over, and bring the needle back to its starting position., When the needle is back where it started, loop the yarn over the needle again. Then, you will follow this up by bringing the needle back through the circle again and yarning over again., Keep repeating the sequence of bringing the needle through the circle and under the wire, yarning over, bringing it back up, and yarning over again.Keep going until you have filled the circle with stitches.
If you are following a pattern, then keep going until you have the recommended number of stitches.

Check the stitches for twisting before you get started.,
Slide the slipknot off of the needle.,
Knit the stitches.",How to Moebius Cast on2," When you have finished casting on and you are ready to begin working, take a moment to check the stitches for twisting. Straighten out any stitches that are twisted before you get started., Before you start knitting, you will need to slip the slipknot off of the needle. This will be your first stitch on the left hand side. Slide it off the needle and pull the tail to unravel it., After you remove the slipknot you can begin working your stitches in the round. Knit every single stitch that you have cast on.Keep in mind that the first round will be a bit difficult to work because the stitches will be very tight. Try to be patient as you get through this round.

",How to Knit Baby Booties," Before sitting down the knit anything, you should decide which yarn you want to use for your project.









The standard yarn weights, from thinnest to thickest, are fingering, sock/baby, sport, DK/light worsted, worsted/afghan/aran, chunky, and bulky.For baby booties, sock or baby-weight yarn is recommended.;
, These booties will be knit flat, so use regular needles instead of double-pointed ones.









The thinner the yarn, the thinner the knitting needles you should use.
The packaging for yarn usually details a needle size recommendation for its weight.

, Before beginning any knitting project, you should always ""gauge"" your yarn, or determine its ""tension."" Simply put, the gauge lets you know how many stitches per inch your specific combination of yarn, needles, and knitting technique will produce. This will help you to either create custom pieces to your desired dimensions or adjust patterns you find on the internet for the materials you have at your disposal. If you don't gauge your yarn, you won't be able to predict how small or large your end product will be—this is very important with baby booties!









Cast on what you estimate to be about five inches worth of stitches.
Work about ten rows in a normal garter stitch (knit all the way across), then work ten rows in whichever pattern you plan to use for the cuff, if you want something other than a garter stitch.
If you plan to use the garter stitch the whole way through, just knit twenty rows of the garter stitch.
Look at the middle portion of each pattern swatch and count out roughly how many stitches per inch you have across the six-inch width.
Measure the length of the ten rows you knit in garter stitch, then the length of the ten rows you knit in stockinette.
Use a ruler for an accurate measurement of inches.
Now, you know how many stitches to cast on for create a specific width of fabric, and how many rows you have to knit to create a specific length of fabric.

, How many inches around to you want the toe to be? The ankle? How many inches up the calf do you want the bootie to rise? Use the information from your gauging exercise to sketch out four important measurements:









The number of stitches to cast on to comfortably fit the toe
The number of stitches needed to comfortable fit snugly at the heel
The number of rows needed to achieve the desired length of the booties base (the part that covers the foot)
The number of rows needed to achieve the desired rise of the bootie up the ankle or calf.

,,









A good rule of thumb to follow is this: once you reach half the desired length of the bootie, knit two or three more rows, then begin decreasing each row by two stitches until you reach the heel.
For example, if the base of your bootie will take twenty rows of knitting, knit 12 or 13 rows, then decrease by two stitches for each row until you reach your twentieth and final row for the base of the bootie.
Make sure that your decreases are evenly spaced.
For example, If you have 29 stitches, follow this pattern to decrease evenly: K13, decrease, K3, decrease, K13. Next row: K12, decrease, K3, decrease, K12. Next row: K11, decrease, K3, decrease, K11.
Continue in this manner until you reach the end of the heel and are ready to knit the cuff.

, Once the base of the bootie is complete, knit however many rows you need to achieve your desired rise up the ankle and calf.









If you want the bootie to have a very low ankle rise of half an inch, and your gauge is six rows per inch, then knit three rows for your cuff.
If you want a high calf rise of four inches, knit 24 rows for your cuff.

, Make sure to bind off loosely, so your bootie does not feel tight and uncomfortable when worn.








,









Fold the fabric in half so that the bootie will be inside out when the seam is sewn up. This is to ensure that the seam is hidden inside the bootie and is not visible.
Using a sewing needle, sew the two edges of the fabric together.

,, Once your basic bootie has been constructed, you can add whatever fun decorations you'd like! Ribbons and buttons that can be added easily with a needle and thread.

Cast on 33 stitches and then work waffle stitch pattern as usual., The waffle stitch makes an interesting scarf as well. It adds some nice texture and an interesting pattern to your work. Try using the waffle stitch to create a scarf as a gift for a friend or just for yourself.

Use a worsted weight acrylic yarn with US size 8 (5mm) knitting needles, or use the yarn of your choice with the needle size recommended on the package.
Cast on 37 stitches if using worsted weight yarn.If you are using a bulky yarn, then you will need fewer stitches, such as 22 or 25.

, You can also use the waffle stitch to make a cozy, textured blanket. Try using the waffle stitch to make a small lap blanket or an extra large blanket to enjoy.

Remember to cast on a multiple of three plus one stitch. For example, you could cast on 99 stitches plus one for a total of 100 stitches for your blanket.

Check your yarn gauge or follow a pattern to determine how many stitches you should cast on for the blanket size you want to make."

You want the knitting to be dense enough that the stuffing does not show through the material so use needles 2-3 sizes smaller than you would normally use for the yarn you have chosen., Casting on is the process of starting the first stitches on the knitting needle before beginning to knit. There are many different methods for casting on depending on your experience level and the look you want to try.


Easy beginner methods include the backwards loop cast on and the long tail cast on.

, Garter stitch is great for this project because it forms a sturdy and flexible piece of knitting. It is also a good stitch for beginners to learn and you can remember it with the poem “back, around, over and under.”

, When you reach row 32 place a colored thread in the middle of the row to mark the location of the neck.

, Keep knitting in garter stitch for an additional 34 rows so that you end up with 66 total rows. At each end of this final row, place a colored thread. These colored threads mark where the body stops and the legs begin.

, Knit 20 stitches, which is half the width of the pattern, and then continue for an additional 39 rows. Cast off at the end of these 40 total rows. This is your first leg.

, Turn the pattern around and rejoin the yarn to the other 20 stitches on the body of the pattern. Knit 40 rows on this side of the pattern, completing the other leg. Once finished, cast off these stitches.

, Starting on a new section, cast on 20 stitches and then knit 40 rows. Cast off. This forms one of the arms of your teddy bear and will be attached later.

, Again, cast on 20 stitches and then knit 40 rows to create the piece for the second arm of your teddy.

, Bring the left edge of your pattern to the right edge and sew down the edges to connect them. Sew them together from the top edge of the pattern where you cast on to the row with the marker at the top of the legs. Rotate the shape so that this seam is on the back of the teddy bear.


Use a blunt tipped needle to sew the pieces together to make it easier.
If you are a beginner, then you can use the backstitch to sew the pieces together. Starting from one side simply push the needle down through both layers and bring around the edge and push down through the same location to begin. Then move over one-quarter inch and bring the needle back up through both layers. Continue stitching until you reach the end of the seam.

, Now that the seam is on the back of the teddy bear there will be two pieces at the bottom that will form the legs. Sew from the top of the legs all the way down the inside seam to the bottom foot seam to close the legs. Do this on both legs.


You can again use the backstitch to sew the seams.

, Use cotton or any type of stuffing to fill the teddy bear. Do not overstuff but fill the teddy completely, including the legs and feet.

, Sew the top seam of your pattern shut to close the head. Try to round the corners slightly if possible. Again you can use the backstitch to connect the seams.

, Fold the arm pieces in half lengthwise and sew along the long end and the bottom edge to make the arms and hands. You can again use the backstitch to sew these seams together if you would like.

, Stuff the arms with the same material you used for the body of the teddy bear. Then close the tops of the arms.

, Attach the arms of the teddy bear to the body using a simple backstitch or other stitch that you prefer. The arms should be attached just below the neck on each side.

, Sew a rounded edge across the corners to connect the two layers and make the edges stick out like ears. To make them stick out a bit close your fingers at the base of the ears and pull them lightly before and after stitching.


You can also do a gather stitch at the base of the ears to help them to stick out more. To knit a gather stitch you would knit a decrease across the length of the ear with a smaller needle size than you have been using.

, Do a gather stitch around the neck where you placed the marker for the neck. Again, you would knit a decrease at this location to bring the neck in and differentiate the head and body.

, Embroider the ears and face of use buttons for the eyes. You can also tie a ribbon around the neck of the teddy bear. You should also remove the markers you used earlier.

, Enjoy your stuffed teddy bear or give it to a friend.

Alternate between knit and purl if desired.",How to Knit a Two Color Italian Cast on," To begin the Italian two color cast on method, you will need to line up the strands. Pull the tails out from your two balls of yarn and then make a slipknot with both strands. Slip the slipknot onto your knitting needle and then tighten it.To make a slipknot, line up the strands and then make a loop about 10 to 12 inches from the ends. Then, make another smaller loop next to this one. Insert the smaller loop into the larger loop and then pull on the tail of your yarn to tighten the loop.;
, Grasp the tail of your yarn with the hand that is holding the knitting needle to keep it in place and then use your other hand to separate the strands. Hold the strands so that one is looped around your thumb and the other is looped around your index finger.Keep the yarn strands taut as you hold them.

, To cast on the first stitch, bring your knitting needle around the two strands of yarn and underneath the strands. Then, loop the front piece of yarn around the knitting needle. Next, bring it back around and under the strands so that the loop is behind the back strand., To cast on a stitch with the other strand of yarn, you will do just the opposite motion. Bring your knitting needle up and over the strands and towards the back strand. Then, loop the back strand of yarn onto the needle as well and return the needle back to the center where you started., To continue casting on, you will need to alternate between these two motions. Keep alternating until you have the desired number of stitches cast on your needle. Then, complete the row by using the single cast on method to cast on one last stitch instead of using the Italian cast on method.To do a single cast on, make a loop in one of your yarn strands, and then turn the loop so that the bottom forms an X. Then, slip the loop onto your needle and pull the yarn to tighten it., After you have cast on your stitches, you can begin working the row according to your pattern, or you can just knit all of the stitches. However, you will need to skip the slipknot that you made to start the cast on. Do not knit or purl into this stitch! You will slip it off after the first row.Make sure to alternate colors as you work so that your Italian cast on will keep its pattern.

, Once you get to the end of your first knit row, you will need to slip off the slipknot that you made at the beginning. Do not knit or purl this stitch. This stitch is the one that has both colors in it because you used both strands to make it., If you want to intensify the contrast between your two colors, try alternating between knitting and purling. You can knit all of the stitches in one color and purl all of the stitches in the other color. This is optional, but it is a nice way to add some extra interest to your work.

Add a fringe to your shawl if you like.,
Block the shawl when it is finished for a more professional look.",How to Knit a Shawl," You will need to find a pattern that fits your skill level. There are patterns designed for all skill levels and your local sewing or knitting store should have a variety of them.


You can purchase a single pattern on its own or find a pattern in a collection, such as in a knitting magazine.
If you are unsure whether a pattern fits your skill level, ask someone working at your yarn store about the difficulty of the pattern.
Whatever your level of skill, pick a knitting pattern that has design that is pleasing to you. You do not want to spend time and money knitting a shawl you do not like.;
, The pattern will tell you both how much yarn to purchase and the ""weight"" of the yarn to use.


The ""weight"" of yarn refers to its thickness. Weights are referred to in terms of their number, zero gauge yarn is very thin, while a 7 gauge yarn is very thick, or with descriptors such as ""super fine"" or ""bulky,"" for instance.It is possible to substitute a different yarn from the one suggested on the pattern, but you will want to select something that has a similar weight.

, The size of needles you use determines how big your loops are and the looseness of the weave.


Needles are sized in millimeters, with US sizes 1 - 50 corresponding to specific millimeter diameters.Some patterns will give you a choice between straight needles and circular needles. The circular needles will actually give you more room for projects that are larger, such as knitting a shawl.

, Yarns can be made of a variety of different fibers. It's best to pick a yarn that feels nice to the touch and will hold up to wear.


Remember that you do not have to purchase the same colors as those shown on the pattern. Choose whatever color you would like.
Also purchase needles at your local yarn store, if you don't already own the gauge required.

, Be sure that you know how to read the pattern and that you have a grasp on the basic steps in knitting the shawl before you even start.


Knitting patterns have a language all their own. Patterns include symbols that stand in for types of stitches.In addition, there are many standard abbreviations that will give directions for completing your project.Luckily, these are largely standardized, so once you learn what a symbol or abbreviate means, you can use it for reading a variety of patterns.

, This will probably be unnecessary if you are an experienced knitter or if the pattern only contains very basic stitches.


The stitches you absolutely need to know are the knit and purl stitches. These can be combined in a wide variety of ways, for example in the garter stitch pattern and the seed stitch pattern.If there are any additional stitches in your pattern that you do not know how to make, you can search for tutorials online or get a knitting instruction book that will show you how to create those specific stitches.

, This will allow you to check your gauge. Remember to use the stitches designated in your pattern so that you get a true sample of how big your stitches will be. You may need to change needle sizes to better meet the gauge.


Matching the gauge, in other words how many stitches you make in a specific distance, specified by the pattern is important in order to make the finished size of your shawl match the size it should be according to the pattern.

, Remember to keep track of your stitches as you go and undo any mistakes you make as quickly as possible, so that you don't have to undo a lot of stitches.

, ""Casting off"" simply refers to finishing off the edge of your shawl, so that it does not unravel and so that you have removed the needles.


To begin casting off, move two stitches from your left needle (which should have all the stitches on it) onto your right. Then take you left needle and pull the first stitch you took off over the second and release it. The second stitch should stay on the right needle. Repeat by taking one stitch from the left needle and moving onto the right, then once again pulling the first over and off of the right needle. Continue this until you have no more loops on the left needle. You will want to tie a knot at the end and cut the thread, leaving a small piece to weave into the shawl.
If you are still unsure how to cast off, it may be helpful to follow more detailed directions here.

, If you choose to add a fringe, you'll want to be certain you have purchased enough yarn to include the extra amount needed.


Adding fringe to the edge of your shawl is easy. Simply cut pieces of yarn all the same size, at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) long. Take several together and thread them through a loop on the edge of your shawl. Tie them off so that they will be permanently attached. Move down the edge of shawl any distance you choose and attach the same number once again. Continue like this, using a standard distance between pieces of yarn to make the fringe look polished.

, Blocking is just a method of stretching your project into shape. The simplest form of blocking is just to stretch your project by hand until it reaches the dimensions outlined in the pattern.


If hand blocking does not work, pin your project down in the dimensions you desire, and with an iron set to the temperature appropriate for the fiber of your yarn, iron it.To get it to set you may need to lightly spritz the project with water but be sure that the fibers you used will not react poorly to water before you try this.
Lacy shawls almost always need to be blocked, while basic shawls usually do not.

Decide how big you want your blanket to be.,
Choose your yarn.,
Select your knitting needles.,
Gather other items you will need.",How to Knit a Lap Blanket1," Lap blankets can range in size from very small to very large. If you are knitting this project for yourself or for someone else, then consider what the ideal measurements might be. You might even consider measuring the width of someone’s lap and the length of their legs to decide how large your blanket should be.For a small lap blanket, the final measurements may be about 24 to 48 inches.
For a medium lap blanket, the final measurements maybe about 30 to 50 inches.
For a large lap blanket, the final measurements may be about 50 to 60 inches.;
, You will need between five and 10 regular sized balls of medium weight yarn to complete a lap blanket. The larger you plan to make the blanket, the more yarn you will need. However, you can also get extra-large balls of yarn that are meant specifically for knitting blankets.


Check the yarn label to determine how many balls you will need to complete your project. If you are in doubt, then it is better to get an extra ball or two.
Use any color or colors you like. You can choose just one color, a couple of colors, or make a rainbow-like blanket with several colors.

, You can use regular knitting needles or circular knitting needles to make a blanket. If you opt for regular needles, just make sure that they are long ones so that they will be able to hold all of the stitches. You can also use a pair of circular needles. The length of nylon suspended between the two circular needles will easily hold all of the stitches.


A pair of size 10 regular or circular needles (32 or 40 inch) is a suggested size for medium weight yarn.However, if you decide to go with a bulky yarn, then you might want to use larger needles, like size 13 needles.
Circular needles are usually meant for knitting in the round, but you do not have to knit in the round when you use them. If you decide to use circular needles, knit across all stitches as you usually would and then turn the stitches around and knit across the row in the opposite direction.

, Before you get started you will need to gather a few more items. You will need:


Pair of scissors. Having a good pair of sharp scissors is always a good idea when you are knitting. You may need them when you switch colors and you will definitely need them when you finish your project.
A large eyed needle for weaving in ends. You can find plastic needles in the knitting sections of craft stores. These are useful for weaving in ends and finishing projects.
Something to keep your yarn in while you knit. If you have a knitting bag, then this is ideal. If not, then you can use an empty box or a bag (canvas or plastic). This will help to keep your yarn from rolling all over the floor while you knit your blanket.
Pattern (optional). If there is a pattern that you want to follow or use as a basic guide, then this may also be helpful as well. However, you do not need a knitting pattern to make a simple lap blanket.

"
"
Cast on your stitches.,
Knit across the first row.,
Continue to knit all rows until you reach the desired size.Getting your blanket to its final length will take time, especially if you are using a medium or light weight yarn.,
Finish the blanket by casting off and weaving in the ends.",How to Knit a Lap Blanket2," To get started, cast on the number of stitches that you will need to get your desired blanket width.To determine how many stitches to cast on, check the gauge of your yarn and needles or use the yarn label to guide you.


You can determine how many stitches to cast on by multiplying the gauge by the desired dimension. For example, if you want a lap blanket that is 24 inches wide and your gauge is 4 stitches per inch, then you would need to cast on 96 stitches.
A 96 stitch cast on would result in a small lap blanket. If you want a medium sized blanket, then try casting on 120 stitches. For a large lap blanket, cast on 160 stitches. For an extra-large lap blanket, cast on 200 stitches.

, After you have cast on your stitches, knit across all of these stitches using a basic knit stitch.However, if you want to try a different stitch or add some embellishment stitches, then you may also do that.

, Try to be patient and just work on the blanket in short sessions every day. Over time, the length will grow. Just keep in mind that it may take several weeks of regular work to complete a blanket.

, When you have finally achieved the desired length, you can finish the blanket. To do this, you will need to cast off your stitches and weave in any loose ends that were left when you switched skeins. Use a plastic needle to weave in the ends. You can simply sew them into the edges of the blanket to hide them.

Add ribbing.,
Do a basketweave stitch.,
Try adding cable stitches.,
Use a seed stitch.The moss stitch or seed stitch adds dimension to knitting projects.",How to Knit a Lap Blanket3," Ribbing is a simple way to add some flair and texture to a lap blanket. To create ribbing in a knit garment, all you have to do is alternate between knitting and purling.


For example, you could create ribbing by knitting 2 stitches and then purling 2 stitches. You would follow this pattern of knit, purl, knit, purl through the whole blanket and it would create a striped effect.

, The basketweave stitch is another simple way to add texture and interest to a lap blanket. To do this, you need to create small squares of knit stitches and purled stitches. These can be as small or as large as you want them to be.


For example, you could make squares that are 4 stitches by 4 stitches. You would simply follow a pattern of knitting 4, then purling 4. After four rows, you would switch the pattern so that you start with purling 4, then knitting 4, and so on.

, Cable stitches give knitting projects a twisting embellishment, and they are easier to do than they look.Making cables in your lap blanket will require a special cable needle and some practice to get the cable stitch down. However, it can add some pretty details to your project.


If you want to add cable stitches to your lap blanket, then you may want to use a stockinette stitch for the background. This will help to make your cables stand out more., If you want your lap blanket to have some texture and dimension, then this is a great way to accomplish that. Try practicing the seed stitch to ensure that you have it down before you use it.

Cast on about 40 stitches.,
Knit every row until the glove is wide enough to wrap around your palm or forearm.,
Cast off, then tie the yarn off.,
Fold your work in half, lengthwise.,
Sew down the first 2 inches (5 centimeters) of so of your glove.,
Tie the tail off, then weave it back up the seam.,
Sew up the bottom edge of your glove.,
Tie the tail off and weave it down the seam.,
Repeat the process for the other glove.",How to Knit a Pair of Fingerless Gloves1," This will be the length of your glove. The finished glove will extend from the top of your palm/knuckles, down past your wrist, and onto your forearm. If you want a shorter glove, cast on fewer stitches. If you want a longer glove, cast on more stitches.Leave a long tail on you yarn. You'll be using it to stitch the glove together in the end.
Use medium worsted weight yarn (size 4) and size 8 knitting needles.;
, This will create a bumpy, purl pattern on both sides of you work. How many rows you knit depends on how wide your palm/forearm is. For most people, however, this will be about 48 rows.Do not alternate between knitting and purling. You want to knit on every row. This will allow the glove to stretch both ways

, Cast off your work first. Cut the yarn, and pull the tail end through the last loop. Gently tug on the tail end to tighten the loop. Do not cut the tail end off.

, The cast on and cast off stitches should run up the side of your arm and palm. The side edges of the piece are now the top and bottom of your glove. Place your hand over the folded piece, with the top of your palm against the top edge. Take note where you thumb starts.

, Thread the tail end onto a yarn needle. Keeping your work folded in half, whipstitch down the long, side edge until you reach your thumb.Pass the needle through both of the edges of the piece.

, Once the top part of your glove is long enough to reach your thumb, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back up the seam, then trim the excess off.

, Place your hand against the glove, and note where your wrist is/the base of your thumb is. This will be about 5 inches (12 centimeters). Thread the bottom tail end of your work, and sew up the side of your glove using a whipstitch. Stop when you reach the wrist area/base of your thumb., When the glove is sewn together, you'll have a hole in the side seam for your thumb. If you are happy with the size of the hole, tie the yarn to itself. Weave the tail end back down a few inches/centimeters, then cut the excess off.

, These gloves are reversible. There is no left or right glove, so you can measure the second glove against the same hand.

Fold the piece in half so that the rib stitches are on the top and bottom edges.,
Sew down the top edge of your piece.,
Tie off the tail and weave it back up the seam.,
Sew up the bottom side edge.,
Tie the tail off and weave it down the seam.,
Repeat this method for the other glove.",How to Knit a Pair of Fingerless Gloves2," This will be the bottom of your glove, so it needs to be wide enough to wrap around your palm or forearm. Make sure that you leave a tail at the start of your work.

, You want to make this rib stitch a little wider than usual, so alternate between doing 2 knits and 2 purls for the entire row. This will make the bottom, wider cuff of your glove.

, Remember to alternate the stitches on each row. If you started with 2 knits on one row, then you should start with 2 purls on the next row. Keep doing this until you have 15 rows total of rib stitching.

, The stockinette stitch is where you alternate knit and purl rows. Knit one row, then purl the next one. This will make the body of your glove.

, You will still have four more rows to knit, so keep this in mind. You want to end on a purl row, regardless.

, As before, alternate between 2 knits and 2 purls. This will make the narrower, top cuff of your glove.

, Cut the yarn, and pull the tail through the loop. Gently tug on the tail to tighten the loop. Do not trim the tail.

, Place your arm down on the piece, so that the top of your palm/knuckles are aligned with the top edge of your work. Note where your thumb is on the side edge.


Make sure that the knit stitch is on the outside.

, Thread a yarn needle, then, keeping the piece folded, sew down the top side edge using a whipstitch. Keep doing until you reach the base of you thumb area—about 2 inches (5 centimeters).


Remember to start sewing from the narrower rib stitch.

, Tie the yarn to itself, then weave it back up the side seam all the way to the top. Snip off any excess yarn.

, Thread your yarn needle with the other tail end of your work. Use a Whipstitch|whipstitch to sew up the bottom side edge. Stop when you reach the base of your thumb/wrist. You will be left with a gap in your glove. This is the thumb hole.

, Once you are happy with the size of the thumb hole, tie the yarn to itself. Weave it back down the side seam a few inches/centimeters, then snip off any excess.

, Both gloves are identical, so you do not need to flip or reverse the pattern.

Take around 40 plastic bags that are clean and 'not' made of degradable plastic.,
Cast on as many stitches as you want with needles around size 3-4mm, until your work is as wide as you want your bag to be.

,
Knit until your work is twice as long as you want your bag to be.,
Cast off and fold your work in half.,
Cast on again, creating enough stitches to knit a narrow strap for your bag.,
Make two of these straps, and sew one to each side of the top inside of your bag with about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) of overlap at each end.",How to Knit a Bag from Plastic Bags," Degradable bags are often marked proudly as such, and will disintegrate after a few months. Cut the seam off the bottom of a bag and remove the handles. Flatten out your bag and cut it in a long spiral from top to bottom, into one long strip 3cm (1in) wide. See this article for more information on preparing the bag prior to knitting.;
,, If you get to the end of a piece of ""yarn"", tie the end to the end of another piece and continue to knit. (Alternatively, you can knit with two strands for a few inches and then drop the old ""yarn"" and continue with the new.)

, Sew up the sides of your bag with more strips of plastic. You should use a crochet hook, as it won't make as many holes in the existing strips as a yarn needle will.

, Knit until the strap is long enough to be attached to the bag at both ends with about 8 centimeter (3.1 in) of overlap. Bear in mind that your straps will stretch a little when you have heavier things in the bag.

, Alternatively, there are patterns online for making a bag with fancier handles that are more challenging to knit."

,
Pick up the yarn through the loop.,
Pull the knot tight, keeping the loop at the top open.








,
Slip this new loop onto one knitting needle.








,
Pull on the ends to tighten the knot around the needle.








",How to Knit1," The long end of the yarn (the one attached to the ball) should be on top of the short end, as shown.;
,, Pull it gently through the loop. Don't pull so much of it, though, that the loose end comes through.








,,,"
"
Hold the needle with the slipknot in your right hand.

,
Drape the working yarn, the yarn attached to your yarn ball, behind your left hand and over your palm.,
Place the needle underneath the yarn across your palm.








,
Pull out your palm from the yarn, and there should be a loop formed around your knitting needle.








,
Pull that loop tight by pulling on the working yarn.,
Repeat this process with your hand and the yarn until you have cast on as many stitches as you would like.",How to Knit2,", Keep your tail yarn, the short end of yarn attached to nothing, out of the way for now.








,,, You have successfully cast on your first stitch!








, Each time you do this, you create a stitch. The Slipknot from the previous step counts as your first stitch and every loop you add is another stitch. Keep your loops facing upwards and uniform; don't allow them to become twisted or it will be difficult to knit from. You also want to make loose loops with this method; tight loops are very frustrating to knit from.








"
"
Hold the needle with the stitches in your left hand, and hold the needle without stitches in your right hand.,
Insert the needle without stitches under the front of the first loop (the one closest to the needle point), and push it through so the right needle sits behind the left needle.








,
Make sure the working yarn, the yarn attached to your yarn ball, lies in the back of your needles.








,
Grab the working yarn attached to the yarn ball (not your tail yarn), and wrap it around the right needle counterclockwise, so that it sits in between the two needles.,
Look in between your two needles.,
Poke the right needle through the left hole to the front of the left needle.,
Now that you've got a new stitch, pull off the old stitch.,
Repeat the knit stitch until you've knitted every stitch that was on the first needle, and they'll all been transferred to the second needle.








,
Switch the needles.,
Knit every row and keep switching needles.",How to Knit3," Consider wrapping some of the working yarn around your right middle finger. This will keep the yarn in the back of your work.








,,, Wrap the yarn from back to front.








, You should see two holes created by the middle yarn.









Maneuver the right needle up and down to position it over the left hole.

, Do this slowly, making sure your loop does not slip off the needle.









If you are not looking down at the needles but straight at them, the process will look a bit different. Start pulling the inserted needle out of the loop slowly, making sure that the yarn you just wrapped around it doesn't fall off. It may help to hold that yarn tight so the loop remains snug around the needle.
As the point of the needle is about to pull completely out of the loop, turn the point so that it faces you and takes the yarn that was wrapped around it along.
What you're doing here is pulling a loop through a stitch. The loop you just pulled onto the second needle is a new stitch that will replace the old stitch.

, Hold onto the un-knit stitches on the left needle with your left hand, and bring the right needle and your knit stitch up and off the the tip off the left needle. If you've created a knot on your right needle, you've knit correctly. (If not pull off whatever you've done, cast on another stitch, and try again.)








,, Move the needle in your right hand with all the finished stitches to your left hand, and move the needle in your left hand that is now empty to your right hand. Make sure your loops are all facing the same way, and your knitted work is to the right of your left needle.








, Keep doing this and you'll start creating a ""garter stitch"" pattern.

, Once you have all of your stitches on the needle, begin working your first wrong side by purling three stitches.The wrong side is the back side of your project. It will look different from the right side of your project. Keep in mind that your working yarn should be in front of your needle to purl.To purl, insert the needle into the stitch in front of the needle holding the stitches. Then yarn over, and pull the yarn through to create a new stitch. Let the old stitch slide off as the new one transfers to your right hand needle., After you finish your three purl stitches, you will need to knit one stitch.Make sure that you transfer the yarn behind the work to knit.

Check the “Tips” section of this article for further advice about casting on yarn or creating knit stitches.

, Knit once into the first stitch, then work one knit stitch into the next two stitches (decreasing the total stitch count by one). Knit once into next stitch.


Doing this will create a second i-cord with three stitches. The second, skinnier cord will sit on top of the first cord and become the top of the stem.

, Continue the i-cord for five more rows.


Work this i-cord the same as previous one, starting each of the five rows in the same stitch.

, Bind off the yarn. Pull all ends to the inside of i-cord.


You may need to use a yarn needle or crochet hook to help push the extra yarn tails through the center of the i-cord.
After drawing all the ends into the cord, trim away any excess still sticking out from either side.

, Create a foundation by casting 28 stitches onto your size 4 (3.5 mm) double-pointed needles.


Note that you should have four of these needles, and the stitches should be distributed evenly among all four. In other words, each needle should have 7 stitches on it.

, Work one knit stitch into each stitch across the first round.

, You'll need to work a series of slip stitches and knit stitches across the second round.


Slip stitch once and knit once, then slip-slip knit to decrease the to decrease the round by one stitch.
Knit one, then make one new stitch by using the left needle to pick up the bar between stitches on the right and left needles; knit into the back of this bar using the right needle.

Repeat this process once more (a total of two times).


Knit once into the next stitch, then knit once into the next two stitches to decrease the count by one.
Repeat this entire process, from the first slip stitch to the final knit decrease, four more times to complete the round.

, Work four more repeats of rounds one and two, creating a total of five round pairs or ten rounds.

, Work one knit stitch across the next two stitches, then knit stitch once into the stitch that follows. Repeat eight times.


Afterward, knit once into the next two stitches and once into the final two that follow.
You may need to slip several stitches around on your four double-pointed needles to create all of the decreases.

, Work one knit stitch into the next two stitches. Repeat this pattern across the entire round.

, Use scissors to cut the yarn, leaving a tail that measures roughly 6 inches (15 cm) long.


Do not bind off the thread yet.

, Insert the stem through the hole at the bottom of the blossom, then insert the blossom tail through the remaining open stitches. Pull the tail to tighten the blossom around the stem.

, Pull any of the remaining tail through a few inner stitches of the stem, using a yarn needle or crochet hook to do so. Tie a slip knot at the end to keep it secure.


The final flower will be between 4 and 5 inches (10 and 12.5 cm) long.

Loop both strands over your non-dominant index finger.,
Hold one strand (or more) strand in each hand.,
Use multiple fingers.,
Let the strands hang.",How to Hold Yarn when Stranded Knitting1," One common method of holding your yarn while stranded knitting is to loop the strands over your non-dominant finger so that you can easily choose the strand that you want to use.The downside of this option is that your strands may get tangled from time to time, or they may slip off of your finger.;
, If you are concerned about your strands getting tangled or about getting mixed up and choosing the wrong one, then you can always hold one (or more) strand in each hand to keep them separated. Hold the yarn you are currently using in your non-dominant hand so that it will be easier to pick up., Another option for holding your yarn while stranded knitting is to use multiple fingers of the same hand to manage multiple strands. For example, you can loop one color over your index finger and another color over your middle finger.This option works best if you only have two colors that you are working with because you will need your ring and pinky fingers to grip the knitting needle.

, You can also let the strands that you are not currently working with hang freely behind your work. Letting the strands hang means that you will frequently be stopping to switch strands, which can slow you down.However, this may be a good option if you do not have to switch strands too often, or if you are just learning how to do stranded knitting.

Select the number of stitches that the work will need.,
Sketch out a motif using a pencil on graph paper.,
- the next step will be to graph it.,
Square up the free flowing design.,
Adjust as necessary to make sure it looks squared and still resembles the motif that you want to knit.

,
Copy the squared motif a few more times in a row to get an idea of the spacing required.,
Make a sampler.,
Make adjustments to the graph as needed and make another sampler.",How to Design Your Own Motif for Knitting," It helps to choose a convenient number of stitches to repeat, such as 10.;
, Use curved lines as needed - the design is free-flowing at this stage.

, Use an eraser to remove any errors until you are happy with the design.

, Follow the most obvious graph squares and put a cross in each square that permits outlining and infill of your design.

,, If you find that the spacing between the motifs is too great, for example, 6 stitches or more, add a fill-in pattern between each motif. Suitable fill-ins can be lines, crosses, shapes, V's, etc. Their purpose is to reduce the number of stitches a color has to carry across the back.

, This might seem like extra work, but it is worth it to see whether or not the motif will work. Knit a 30-stitch sampler. If it works, great - go ahead. If not, back to the drawing board.

, Samplers can be used for small craft projects such as pin cushions, doll's clothing, etc.

Try a yarn guide.,
Keep your unused strands loose.,
Separate your yarn balls.",How to Hold Yarn when Stranded Knitting2," If the yarn tends to slip off of your finger or gets tangled with the other yarn colors you are using, then a yarn guide might be a helpful option for you. This is a device that slips over your finger and you insert the yarn stands through the device to keep them separated. The device holds the yarn strands so you don’t have to worry about them as much.Check your local craft store or look online for a yarn guide.
These guides are also known as knitting thimbles and strickfingerhuts., Holding your strands too tightly may result in puckering, which can affect the outcome of your finished project. Try to keep a loose hold on the strands so that they do not cause the stitches to pucker.Letting your strands hang or draping them over your fingers is a good way to ensure a loose grip. Check the tension now and then to ensure that it is not too tight.

, Another good way to help prevent tangling while you are stranded knitting is to keep you yarn balls separated.To do this, you can place your yarn balls on opposite sides of you or even put them into separate containers while you work. For example, you could place each ball into a separate bag or plastic container while you work.


Move the containers away from each other as well. For example, you could place one container on one side of you and another container on your other side.

Gather your materials.,
Trace the outline of your purse onto your fabric.,
Cut out your fabric.,
Fold over the top edge to create a seam.,
Sew along the outer edges of the fabric sides and bottom.,
Add a zipper, Velcro, or a snap to close the purse if desired.,
Tuck the liner into your purse.,
Pin along the edges.,
Stitch along the top edge of your liner and purse.",How to Add a Liner to Knitted or Crocheted Bags," Lining a crocheted or knitted purse is quite easy, but you will need some special materials before you get started. You will need:Your knitted or crocheted bag.
Enough fabric to line your bag.
A ruler or measuring tape (optional).
A piece of chalk.
Pins.
Some thread and a needle
A sewing machine (optional).
A clasp for your bag, such as a zipper, Velcro, or a snap (optional).;
, To ensure that your liner will be the same size and shape as your bag, lay out your fabric so that it is doubled. Then, place your purse over the fabric and use the chalk to outline it.Another option is to measure the length and width of your purse and then measure your fabric.You can sue the chalk to mark where you will need to cut the fabric.

, Cut around the edges of the chalk lines you have made on the fabric. Make sure that you cut through both layers of the fabric so that you will have two of the same size pieces when you are done.You can pin the edges of the fabric before you start cutting if you want to ensure that it does not slide around. This may be necessary for a slippery fabric, such as satin.

, After you have cut out your two pieces, fold over what will be the top edge of each piece. Fold over about ½” to 1” of fabric. If the fabric has a print, then fold it over so that the print is showing on both sides.After you fold over the fabric, pin along the edges to secure it in place.
Then, sew along the edges of the fabric pieces to create the top seam of your purse. Sew about ¼” to ½” from the edge of the fabric.

, Next, place your fabric pieces together so that the rough edges of your seam are facing outwards. If your fabric has a print on it, then the print should be facing itself.Then, sew along the outer edges of the sides and bottom of your fabric pieces to attach the two pieces. Sew about a ½” to 1” from the edges of the fabric.
You can sew the edges with a sewing machine or by hand. Use a straight stitch to create a strong seam.
Make sure to leave the top part of your fabric open. This will be the opening of your purse’s iner.

, If you want to add a zipper, some Velcro, or a snap to close your purse, do so before you sew the liner in place. If you are using a snap or Velcro, then make sure that they are centered on the inside of the liner.Check to see if the closure you are adding will fit together properly before you secure the pieces in place.

, After you have finished making the liner for your purse, you can tuck it inside of your knitted or crocheted bag. Make sure that the rough edges of the seam are facing into your knitted or crocheted bag. The liner you have created should fit easily inside of your bag. If it is too large, then you can sew a new seam 1/” to 1” in from the original seam. This will make the liner smaller.

, To secure the liner in place while you sew it to the crocheted or knitted bag, you may want to pin it into place. Place some pins along the top edge of the liner to attach it to the purse edge.You can pin the liner right along the edges of the purse or pin it an inch or two in if you prefer.
Make sure that the seams are lined up. If you added a means of closing the purse, then make sure that this is properly lined up as well.

, After you have secured your liner in place, you can begin to stitch it.Sewing by hand works best for attaching your liner to the purse. This is because the sewing machine may catch on the loops of your knit or crocheted purse.Thread a needle with the color thread of your choice and then begin to sew along the edge of the liner.
Tie a knot at the end of your piece of thread to hold it in place after your first pass through the fabric pieces.
Sew all the way around the liner edge and then tie off the thread.
After you finish sewing the liner in place, your purse is ready to use! Fill it with your normal purse contents or give it to someone as a gift.

Choose a time where there are no other distractions, such as when your kids are at school, your spouse is at work, or your parents are out for the evening.,
Create a comfortable environment.,
Start with small projects.,
Choose patterns at your level.,
Sit with a knitting buddy.,
Be observant.,
Join an online community.,
Play some of your favorite music or turn on the radio so you can listen as you knit.,
Listen to podcasts.",How to Avoid Getting Bored While Knitting," Getting interrupted often can make knitting frustrating.;
, Knitting is a relaxing activity, so it's best to find an area that makes you feel at ease, such as a comfortable chair or couch or even your bedroom. You can also place pillows and blankets around you to create a cozy nest. Along with snacks and/or water you won't have to leave your knitting if you feel hungry or thirsty.

, If you're new to knitting, it's best to begin small before moving onto more difficult tasks. Scarves, socks, and hats are excellent choices. You can look up easy patterns online and try them out. Even if your first attempts are knotted or filled with holes, remember that you'll improve as you practice. As you become more experienced with knitting, you can branch out into different areas and see what you like to make.


If you find that focusing on one task makes you bored, try having different projects occurring at the same time. That way, you have a variety of choices, and you can change your knitting routine whenever you want.
Look through a stitching dictionary, and find patterns that appeal to you.
Create your own project using different stitch patterns you find, combining them into one long scarf or create individual squares which can later be connected into a blanket or afghan.

, Start with easy, basic patterns written specifically for beginners. Nothing frustrates someone more than starting a project, finding it too difficult and then abandoning the craft altogether. As you improve at knitting, choose more complex patterns, such as designs featuring lace, Fair Isle colorwork or cabling. These can help keep you amused, especially with larger projects such as sweaters.

, Knitting with other people is a great way to pass the time as you can chat with them while engaging in a relaxing activity. It's best to pair up with a more advanced knitter. That way, you can turn to them for guidance if you find yourself stuck. They can also offer helpful criticism regarding your knitting while pointing out any mistakes before they worsen. Watching them knit is also a good way to learn, as observing another's techniques can help you develop your own.

, As you knit, pay attention and make sure that you know what you're doing. It's easy to mess up without even realizing it. You may feel discouraged if you catch an error that lies a few rows back, so keep an eye out for any mistakes. If you feel uncertain about your knitting, look through articles and tutorials on the Internet for guidance, or ask someone who knits for advice. Don't hesitate to seek help if necessary.

, Many online communities such as Ravelry.com and others have knitalongs or KALs. This is when many people knit the same pattern at the same time and can get advice on the pattern or give advice to others. Keeping your laptop or tablet nearby and open to the community, lets you put down your work to rest from time to time and chat with others about it. Breaking up your knitting time this way instead of trying to do a marathon knitting session makes you less likely to get bored.





, Music is relaxing but don't turn on the TV. Turning on the TV can be quite distracting and cause you to make more mistakes as you get pulled in by whatever is on or even commercials.

, There are quite a number of knitting-related podcasts by your fellow knitters which help to pass the time and help you feel like you're in a group setting with others.

Choose the yarn you'd like to use.,
Choose double-pointed needles to fit your wool.,
Try this cast-on, which means that you won't have to sew the toe up later.,
Take a third needle and knit each loop on the first needle.,
Notice how the stitches, when knitted on each needle, are suspended between the two double pointed needles.,
Using the third needle (the floating needle), knit 1, make 1 (using the loop between stitches).,
Do the same on the second casting-on needle.,
Remember this pattern of adding a stitch at the second and penultimate stitch on each side.,
Knit until the sock is about 4cm (1.5"") from the back of the heel when tried on.,
Begin working the heel.,
Get all your needles back to normal again, with four active needles (symmetrical) and one floating needle.,
Continue to knit the whole four needles as you were before you started the heel.,
Continue to knit until you're an inch or two from the top, and then begin to k2p2 (knit 2, purl 2) for the ribbing.,
Cast off very loosely, even looser than you think might be needed, because tight casting-off can mean that your sock is hard to get on and uncomfortable.
",How to Knit Socks," Be aware that yarn that is too thick will not make very practical socks––though it will make a nice set of slippers!;
, As this sock pattern is symmetrical, you will need five needles: four to hold the work, and one floating needle to work the sock with.

, Take two needles and wrap the yarn around them in a figure-of-eight. Each loop will become a stitch. For small to medium socks cast on eight loops on each of the two needles, and for large socks cast on ten.
, Then take the first needle and knit the stitches on the second needle. The stitches should now be on the first and third needles. These stitches are allowed to become loose, as you will be tightening them up later.
, You should find this cast on gradually less awkward!
, Knit until you are halfway over the needle. Insert a marker, to mark the centre-back of the sock. Take a new needle, and knit until there is one stitch left, make 1 and knit the last stitch.


To make one stitch hold your work flat and find the yarn from the previous row suspended between the needles. Pick it up using the tip of the right-hand needle, move it onto the left-hand needle and knit it as if it were a normal stitch.


, The work should be symmetrical and there should be all four needles active plus one floating needle. On large socks you should have six stitches per needle, and on smaller ones you should have five.
, Knit the first row (all four needles), and add stitches in this way to the next. Every other row, add stitches in this way. Continue until you have 11 (small), 12 (medium), 13 (large) or 14 (very large) stitches on each of your four needles.

, (If the foot is not present, ask for measurements in advance!)

, Keeping the end-stitches very tight will prevent structural holes. This method is called knitting short rows.

Switch to a new mode: work only on the two needles on either side of your marker. Leave the two needles for the front of the sock idle, and knit back and forth (using knit and purl) on the back two needles to construct the heel. Treat these two needles as one––you can even slip them all onto one needle, as long as you can keep the symmetry going.






The first half of the heel involves systematically putting stitches ""on hold"". Knit all stitches except the last, then slip the yarn to the front of the work (between the needles). Slip the unknitted stitch onto the other needle and slip the yarn to the back of the work again. Turn the work around, and slip the unknitted stitch back onto the empty needle––then continue to purl as usual. This should result in the unknitted stitch being ""a row behind"", looking like it has been looped by the yarn. It will be ""on hold"" until you pick it up again later. It will remain on the needle, and there will always be the same number of stitches on the needle.






Purl the rest of the row except the last stitch, ""wrapping"" it in the same way, leaving it unknitted and dormant.






Turn the work and knit, until there are two left on the needle (one of which is dormant). Wrap this second-to-last stitch as before, and turn the work. Purl all but the last two stitches, wrap the second-to-last stitch, and turn the work.






Each row, wrap the next stitch in until you've wrapped seven stitches on each side. The last row of this process should be purling, followed by wrapping the seventh stitch.





To finish the second half of the heel, begin picking up the stitches one at a time. Knit one row, and when you get to the first wrapped stitch, pick up the loop at the same time and knit it. Wrap the next stitch again. Then turn the work around and start purling. This stitch is now ""active"" again.
At the end of each row, pick up and ""reactivate"" another stitch, knitting the loop with the stitch. Each time you do this, wrap the next inactive stitch as you did when de-activating them.
When you've reactivated all the stitches, you should have a heel-shaped piece of knitting. The last row of the heel should be a purl row, and you should pick up and activate the last of the wrapped stitches.






, Knit until you reach the part where the heel joins the main part of the sock that you've been ignoring.


If at this point you continue to knit, there will most likely be a little but annoying hole in the ankle where the heel rejoins the sock. The next step is written in to prevent this.

, When you get to the part where the heel rejoins the main sock, pick up the yarn from between the two needles and make a new stitch. On the next pass, knit this with the stitch next to it, two together. This will prevent the annoying hole. Do the same thing on the other side of the heel.

, Ribbing will prevent the top of the sock from curling up - though if you'd like a pixie-boot effect for slippers or similar then feel free to ignore this step!

Decide what you want to knit.,
Search for a knitting pattern.,
Gather supplies according to the knitting pattern.",How to Read a Knitting Pattern1," Choose a knitting project that you want to start, whether it is something for yourself or another person.


You might decide on an easier knitting project, like a scarf, if you’re a beginner. Or choose a project based on wanting to learn a new skill, stitch, or pattern.
If you’re knitting something for a friend, ask them exactly what they want. Jot down some notes on the color, size, and type of yarn they want, or even have them send you a photo of something similar they like.;
, Check out crafting or sewing stores or look online for a knitting pattern of your choice to start reading the pattern and embark on the project.


You’ll find knitting patterns in the yarn section of a craft store, or near the sewing patterns or other guides.
Look out for knitting patterns of different difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, difficult) depending on your experience and knitting ability.
If you find your knitting pattern online, you may want to print it out to easily refer to it throughout your project.

, Buy yarn and knitting needles according the recommendations provided with the pattern for best results.


Knitting needles generally come in aluminum, wood, or plastic varieties ranging from sizes numbered 0000 to 50. There are also special circular and double pointed needles for certain projects.Yarn comes in a wide variety of natural and synthetic materials at different weights and in different colors. Ensure that the length of the yarn you buy is enough for the project it calls for.You might choose different yarn and needles than the pattern suggests to achieve a different effect, but you should test out the result by knitting a few test rows first.

Follow S, M, L, XL for size.,
Understand written terms and abbreviations.,
Understand the meaning of symbols.,
Follow the instructions for one row at a time.",How to Read a Knitting Pattern2," Pay attention to the size differences if a pattern provides them. Instructions will generally be listed with the smallest size first and the others in parentheses in this format: S (M, L, XL).


For example, if a pattern tells you to cast on 10 (12, 14, 16) stitches to begin and you want to make a size Large, you would choose 14 stitches to cast on.Note the dimensions that the pattern provides for the completed size. The right size for you will likely differ from the typical size you would buy in a store.
It is useful to use a highlighter to mark the corresponding numbers for the size you choose to knit throughout the entire pattern before you begin. This makes it much easier to follow the instructions according to your size.
The size of the finished item is sometimes stated as the size ""after blocking."" Blocking is a technique of shaping fabric, usually after washing. For instance, many sweaters are blocked by laying them out and patting them into place while they are still damp, then leaving them to dry.

, Follow the meanings for these phrases when they appear:



As established: Continue to knit the center part of a pattern that you have already set up (the pattern may call for adding or subtracting stitches at either end of the center pattern).

BO: Bind off (aka cast off) to finish your knitted piece.

You may choose a knitting pattern chart over written instructions if you are more of a visual person and prefer reading instructions from symbols rather than words.

, Read the key provided for a knitting pattern chart, which will tell you what each symbol in a square means. In general, the following symbols mean:


Blank square: Knit a stitch (right side) / purl a stitch (wrong side)
Horizontal line: Purl a stitch (right side) / knit a stitch (wrong side)
Diagonal line: Knit two stitches together (a decrease)
Circle: Yarn over, Read the chart from bottom to top. A right side (RS) row will be read from right to left, while a wrong side (WS) row will be read from left to right.If the bottom row of a chart has two blank squares, followed by two horizontal lines: Start row 1 (RS) by reading the row right to left, which would mean purl two stitches (p2) then knit two stitches (k2). If the row is wrong side (WS), it will be read left to write, meaning knit two stitches (k2) then purl two stitches (p2).
The pattern will specify how to read each row based on the key and whether the row is right side or wrong side.

Try the headband on.",How to Knit a Headband1," You will need needles in size 8, 9 or 10 (US size) and a worsted weight (normal) yarn in a color you like. Gather these materials to begin your project.;
, Casting on is the process of beginning your first row of stitches, to which all the other stitches will be attached. The backwards loop cast on is as easy cast on for beginners to learn.


Pull ten inches from your ball and make a loop in the yarn. Bring the long end through the loop and then pick up the yarn that is lying across the inside of the loop. Pull the loop while holding both ends of the rest of the thread. Slip a needle through the loop and tighten so that it is snug on the needle. Holding the needle with your right hand, drape the side of the yarn still attached to your yarn ball behind your left hand and around your palm. Bring the needle under the yarn across your palm and pull out your hand, leaving a loop formed around your knitting needle. Pull the loop tight and you have completed your first cast on stitch. Continue with the next stitch by wrapping the yarn behind your hand and around your palm once more until you have the desired number of stitches.

, For this project, either the garter stitch or cabbage stitch are recommended. The garter stitch in particular is a useful stitch that many beginners learn and will produce a sturdy, flexible piece of knitting.


To complete the garter stitch, hold your needle with the cast on stitch in your left hand and your other needle in your right hand. Insert the right needle into the first loop between the topmost stitches on the left needle so that the right needle crosses beneath the left needle. The yarn should lie to the back of your needles. Wrap the end yarn around the tip of the needle counterclockwise and hold it with your right index finger. Gently pull the tip of the right needle back through the first loop, keeping the yarn you looped around on the needle. Slowly pull the right needle all the way through and bring it up so that it is close and on top of the left needle. Be careful not to pull too hard so you don’t pull it out. Move the right needle upwards so that only the first loop on the left needle slides off over the top. Continue the rest of the stitches by inserting the right needle into the next loop on the left needle. Once all the loops are on the right needle you have finished your row. Switch the needles into the opposite hands and repeat for the next row.

, Casting off is the process of making the last row of stitches for your project. This last row must finish the stitches so that they cannot unravel later on. Casting off is an essential technique when learning to knit.


When you get to the last row, knit the first two stitches onto your right needle. Push the left needle into the first stitch that you made on the right needle (the bottom stitch). Lift the first stitch over the second stitch (by moving it upwards) so that it is no longer attached to either needle. Knit another stitch from the left needle to the right needle and complete the same process (insert the left needle in between the stitches and then lift the bottom stitch over the top stitch). Continue until there are no stitches on the left needle and just one stitch on the right stitch. Remove your needle, cut the yarn ball away and pull the loose end through the loop and tighten to tie off.

, This swatch will be used to determine how many stitches to use for your headband and can also be good practice if you are a beginner. Cast on and knit about a 4"" x 4"" sample square, and measure how many stitches are in each inch, and how many rows, with the yarn you've picked. Write down that information.


You will need this gauge swatch to determine the number of stitches for your final headband to be the width you would like.

, (If you were getting 10 stitches per inch, you'd cast on 25, for example.) In this example, it'll be 16 stitches for size 8 to 10 needles.


You can make a headband that is a bit wider or skinnier if you choose.
Good beginner cast on methods include the long tail cast on and backwards loop cast on.

, Heads vary in size, so measure your own, and take off one to two inches (2.5-5 cm) for the stretchiness of the stitch. Again you should use the number of stitches you have calculated using your gauge swatch minus an inch or two (2.5-5 cm).

, Because you'll want your headband to have some stretchiness, knit in a garter or cabbage stitch. In this example, cabbage stitch is used.

, You can test the length by wrapping it around your head. Remember that it must be tight enough to stay on your head without falling down but loose enough to fit onto your head.

, Finish knitting the headband by casting off at the end. This prevents the knitting from unraveling later.

, Using a piece of yarn and a blunt needle sew the two edges of your headband together. Line the edges up next to each other. Then, starting at one end push the needle through both layers and around the edge back through the same hole. Then move to the next stitch and push the needle through. Bring the needle around the edges and push through the next stitch along the edge. Continue until you reach the other edge of the pieces and have knitted the edges completely together.


For added flair, twist the headband once before sewing the edges together. The twist will make the headband more comfortable at the back of your head, so your hair can fall normally.

, The headband should now be completed and you can try it on to make sure it fits correctly. Enjoy wearing your headband and keeping your ears warm!

You will need to know how to perform the knit stitch, the purl stitch and the slip stitch to be able to complete this headband.
You will also need to know how to cast on and cast off your stitches., You will need size 10.5 knitting needles and one ball of yarn with a yardage of about 87 yards/100 grams in a color of your choice. These materials will be used in your project.

, Cast on and knit about a 4"" x 4"" sample square, and measure how many stitches are in each inch, and how many rows, with the yarn you've picked. Write down that information to help you determine the number of stitches for your final headband.


If you do not wish to make a swatch then you can simply knit the first couple of rows and see if it looks long enough.

, Usually you will use 13 stitches to create your headband. If you use a different number of stitches then you will have to readjust your headband rows to suit. You can use whichever cast on method your prefer for this project.


Good beginner cast on methods include the long tail cast on and backwards loop cast on.

, This headband entails a repeating pattern every eight rows. The eight rows are each different to create one section of the cable pattern. You will use the knit stitch, the purl stitch and slip stitches to create these eight rows. You will also need a cable needle for these eight stitches.


In row one knit thirteen stitches.
In row two knit two stitches, purl nine stitches and then knit two stitches.
In row three knit two stitches, slip stitch the next three stitches to the cable needle and hold in front, knit three stitches, knit three stitches from the cable needle and then knit five stitches.
In row four knit two stitches, purl nine stitches and knit two stitches.
In row five knit thirteen stitches.
In row six knit two stitches, purl nine stitches and knit two stitches.
In row seven knit five stitches, slip stitch the next three stitches to the cable needle and hold it in back, knit three stitches, knit three stitches from the cable needle and knit two stitches.
In row eight knit two stitches, purl nine stitches and then knit two stitches.

, Repeat this eight row pattern 14 times or until the headband is the correct length. Remember it will stretch so you will want it to be tight enough to stay on your head.

, Cast off your last row to finish the end of the headband and prevent it from unraveling.

, Using a piece of yarn and a blunt needle sew the two edges of your headband together. Line the edges up next to each other. Then, starting at one end push the needle through both layers and around the edge back through the same hole. Then move to the next stitch and push the needle through. Bring the needle around the edges and push through the next stitch along the edge. Continue until you reach the other edge of the pieces and have knitted the edges completely together.

Assemble your blanket.",How to Knit a Patchwork Blanket," There aren't any hard and fast rules when it comes to knitting needle requirements for working with certain types of yarn. Choose a yarn that you enjoy and realize that chunkier yarns will knit up faster than thin or fine yarn. The same is true of your needles. If you'd like a larger looser blanket, work on larger needles.


Consider using size 19 US or 15.0 mm needles and super chunky yarn to create a large blanket that comes together quickly.;
, Find the end of your yarn which is usually tucked into the middle of the ball of yarn. Make a loop near the end of the yarn as though you're going to tie a knot. The long end should be on top of the short end. Fold the top loop over to the inside of the loop. Pick up the loop and pull it through tightly. Slip this loop onto one of your knitting needles and pull the end to tighten it.









You'll know you've correctly made a slip knot if you can can simply continue pulling the loop and it comes apart.

, Hold the needle with the slip knot in your right hand. Drape the working yarn over the palm of your left hand so your fingers can close into a loose fist and grab it. Wrap your thumb around the yarn so that it threads behind your thumb (if your palm is facing you). Use the point of your needle to thread underneath your thumb. Pull the needle through so that the yarn is lifted off your your thumb and onto your needle.







, Cast on until you have 14 stitches on your needle. This will eventually be an edge of one of your patchwork squares. Each square will measure about 20cm (7.5 inches). Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand so you can begin knitting.Continue grasping the yarn in your palm with your fingertips, this will keep it out of the way and create tension so that you can quickly cast on.

, Hold the needle that doesn't have any stitches on it in your right hand. Insert the tip of this needle into the stitch closest to the tip of the other needle.


You should insert it under the stitch so that the needle goes from front to back and forms an ""X"".

, Grab the working yarn with your right hand and wrap it around the right needle so that it's in between the needles. Slowly pull the right needle down and through the yarn on the left needle.









You should keep the working yarn between the needles while you do this.

, Your right needle should now be on top of the left needle. Pull this stitch off the left needle by lifting the right needle up and away from the left needle. This will transfer the stitch from the left needle to the right needle.








Try to work near the end of the needles so that the stitches don't become tight on the middle of the needles. But, make sure that they're not so close to the ends of the needles that the stitches fall off.

, Knit each of the stitches that you cast on until you come to the end. This makes a complete row of garter stitches. Transfer the needle with the stitches to your left hand and continue knitting them to make another row. Knit rows until your square measures 20cm (7.5 inches).








Make sure you knit into the stitches that are looped onto the left needle, not the stitches of the row you just completed.

, Keep the needle that has your knitted square in your left hand. Knit two stitches onto the empty needle in your right hand. You'll use these stitches to cast off the rest of the square that's on the other needle. You should always have two stitches on the right needle.Casting off or binding off will work the square off of the needles. This means you'll be able to take it off the needles without worrying that it will come undone. You'll be able to sew this square to another completed square when you assemble the blanket.

, Push the tip of the left needle into the first stitch on your right needle. This should be the first stitch that you knit on this needle., Use the tip of the left needle to lift the first stitch over the second stitch. This means you'll be lifting the stitch and sliding it off of the right needle. You should now have only one stitch on the right needle.







, You'll always need two stitches on the right needle so that you can lift up and over a stitch to cast it off. Continue casting off the stitches until you reach the end of the row.








You should have a completely empty needle and only one stitch still on the other needle.

, Remove the needle from the last stitch. You should see a big loop. Hold onto this so that it doesn't come unraveled and use scissors to cut the working yarn. Leave about an arm's length of yarn when you cut it. Take the yarn and tie it through the loop, pulling it tightly.








You'll still have extra yarn tailing from the end of your square after you've tied it off. You'll use this to sew the squares together.

, You can make the blanket as large as you like, keeping in mind that you'll need to knit more squares. For a large square blanket, you might want to use seven squares across by seven squares down.Consider laying out your squares on a large surface so you can arrange them, especially if you used different colored yarn. Alternate the squares so that the rows are vertical next to a square where the rows are turned horizontal.

, Select the squares you'll be sewing together. Take a large sewing needle and thread the yarn from a square's tail. Adjust the square so that the square you're sewing it to is turned opposite.








For example, if the square with the sewing tail has rows arranged horizontally, the square you're sewing it to should be arranged vertically.

, Take the threaded sewing needle and insert it into the stitch of the square that's laying next to it. Pull the needle so the yarn tightens. Insert the needle back into the square with the tail you're using. You should be stitching the two squares together by going back and forth with the yarn.








Continue doing this till you reach the end of the squares. The two squares should be completely sewn together now.

, You'll be left with tails of yarn on your squares that you won't need to sew into other squares. Take your tail and thread it onto the needle. But, instead of using it to connect to another square, simply weave it in between the knots on one square's edge. Make a knot in the yarn and cut it off so that it doesn't come undone.








Weaving in the end can prevent a loose end from unraveling and can make your knitting look more polished.

, Continue sewing together squares until you have seven squares in a row. Create seven of these rows total so you can stitch together every row and make a large blanket. Or, make a smaller blanket by using fewer squares. You can also make a rectangular blanket by making the rows shorter than the blanket is long.Consider adding beads and other decorative objects to your knitting. You could also just sew on the beads afterwards. Also consider adding knit flowers, leaves, or decorative edging.

Row 1: Loosely cast on 16 stitches, place marker, cast on a further 16 stitches (32 stitches in total).
Row 2: Knit on the wrong side (WS).
Row 3: Decrease row. Knit until you are 2 stitches before the marker. Knit the next two stitches together through the back of the loop and then knit to the end of the row (RS).
Row 4: Knit WS.
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you are left with just 2 stitches on the needle (WS), pass the left stitch over the right stitch so you have just one stitch left and then fasten off.;
, If you are not a fan of sewing squares together though, try picking up stitches.

Look at your square as a diamond with the top point being where you finished knitting and fastened off. You can add a square (actually a diamond) to the right and left sides, and then add a diamond between those two diamonds. This photo should help:



 


When starting diamonds that are on the right side of the blanket (like the green one), loosely cast on the first 16 stitches using the long tail cast on. Then place marker and pick up 16 stitches alongside of diamond to the left of the new one.
For diamonds that are on the left edge of the blanket, pick up 16 stitches in the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, then loosely cast on 16 stitches using the cable cast on.
For diamonds that are not on the edges, pick up 16 stitches from the side of the diamond to the right, place marker, pick up center stitch from the tip of the diamond below, pick up 15 stitches on the side of the diamond to the left.
Rotate your work and you will end up with a nice square or rectangular blanket.

If you are willing to spend lots of time on a project, you can choose a lighter-weight yarn. This will take some extra time, but will produce a thinner, soft knitted piece.
If you want the project to come along faster and are okay with thicker knitting, go for a bulky yarn. This is also suitable for beginners since it's easier to grip and see your stitches.
Remember to choose needles that fit the weight of yarn you're using.
If knitting straight from a pattern, always choose around right weight, or you might end up with something different than you expected.;
, If you're making a scarf, you probably don't want to choose a scratchy wool. If you are making a dishcloth, merino is definitely not a good choice! Instead, choose a fiber that you like and that will work well for the project you're making.

, If you have a low budget, you don't want to be purchasing loads of expensive luxury yarn. Once you have an idea of what type of yarn you'd like, look online and offline to find something that matches your budget.

, A hard project isn't a good start since you'll get discouraged quickly if you make mistakes.

, Good choices for beginners are a coaster, dishcloth, or scarf.


A scarf might take a while, but it can give you lots of valuable practice with one or two stitches.
A coaster or dishcloth are perfect for beginners, as they provide immediate gratification because of their small size and their small amount of work. Additionally, they make great gifts for a loved one if you want to give something handmade!

, These stitch patterns use only the knit and purl stitches, and won't puzzle you like more advanced stitch patterns such as ribbing or seed stitch.

It may seem like your project isn't coming out right, but chances are it will look better as you continue on the pattern.

, Nobody can make a beautiful, perfect knitted piece on their first try. Prepare to drop or twist some stitches, have a weird tension, or have your project come out a shape different than the one you intended. This doesn't mean you did a bad job; it simply means you're still learning.

",How to Knit a Baby Blanket," Ways of finding stitch patterns include:









Consult a stitch dictionary (a collection of instructions for how to knit decorative stitch patterns).
Search for complete blanket patterns online.
Use garter stitch (knit all stitches on both sides of the fabric). The result is bumpy on both sides. You can also use stockinette stitch (alternate rows of knit and purl stitches) to knit a baby blanket that's bumpy on one side and smooth on the other.;
, You can knit a baby blanket out of almost any yarn, but a few general rules apply:









The thicker or chunkier the yarn, the faster the blanket will knit up.
The softer the better.
Some parents may prefer that you use only natural fibers like cotton or wool. However, many will appreciate the ease of care featured with artificial fibers such as polyester.

, Most yarn wrappers will recommend the appropriate-size needle for working that sort of yarn.








, The typical gauge swatch is 4 inches by 4 inches (10 cm by 10 cm).









If you're using an already-established knitting pattern, it will tell you how many stitches and rows it should take you to make a swatch of a certain size. Adjust the needle size up or down until you reach the appropriate number of stitches and rows.
If you're making up your own pattern as you go, you can adjust needle size as necessary until you like how the stitches look. Then count how many stitches and rows are in a 1-inch-by-1-inch (2.5-cm-by-2.5-cm) piece of the swatch. Multiply these by how many inches wide and long you want the baby blanket to be. (If you're using metric measurements, multiply by how many centimeters wide you want the blanket to be, then divide by 2.5.) This tells you how many stitches to cast on and how many rows to knit to make the baby blanket the correct size.
If you're using a decorative pattern, it may require multiples of a certain number of stitches (for example, multiples of 4 or multiples of 5) to come out correctly. You might also want to add a few stitches of garter or stockinette stitch on either side of the blanket as edging. Round your target number of stitches up or down to reach the appropriate stitch multiple, then add any edging stitches to the count.

,,









Turn your work and continue knitting until the blanket is the desired length.

,









If you're not sure how to cast off, try this: knit two stitches, then use your left-hand needle to gently pry the bottom stitch on the right-hand needle up and off the needle, so it drapes over the other stitch (which remains on the right-hand needle). Knit another stitch, so you have 2 stitches on the right-hand needle again, then pry the bottom stitch up and over the top stitch, off the needle. Repeat, and then pull the tail end of the yarn through the last stitch.

Consider a heavier material for the outside, such as canvas, linen, or twill. Consider a lighter material, such as cotton, for the inside.;
, Make sure that all of the edges and corners align.

, Leave a small gap 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) up from one of the narrow edges. The gap needs to be along one of the long edges, and big enough so that you can turn the fabric inside out. Remove the pins as you sew.

, Try to clip as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting the thread. This will help reduce bunching and bulking. If you need to, use something slender, such as a chopstick or knitting needle, to help turn the corners.

, If you need to, use sewing pins to hold the flap down. Be sure to tuck any excess fabric into the gap as well. This is your pocket, and the base for the casings, which will hold the knitting needles., Make sure that you are inserting the folded part of the ribbon. Try to align it with the top part of the gap, if you can. When you are done, pin the ribbon in place.The ribbon should ideally be 5 inches (12.7 centimeters) from the bottom edge of the roll up. If you need to, use a seam ripper to undo some of the stitching in the side of the roll up.
Choose a thin ribbon. Something around ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) would be ideal.
Bias tape will also work well for this.

, Try to get as close to the edge as you can. Start and finish sewing at the ribbon, making sure to backstitch a few times. This with reinforce the ribbon as well as prevent the thread from unraveling.

, Use a tailor's chalk or washable pen to do this.


You can also use sewing pins to mark the lines.

, You can use a thread color that matches the fabric, or a contrasting color for something more interesting. Be sure to backstitch a few times at the start and end of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling.

, Slide your knitting needles into the slots, then roll the fabric up. Start rolling from the bare side, and work your way towards the ribbon. Wrap one ribbon piece once or twice around the bundle, then wrap the other ribbon once or twice in the opposite direction. Tie both ribbons together into a bow.

Restrict yourself to one or two skeins of yarn and one or two pairs of needles.,
Choose your yarn carefully, because each type of project you make needs a specific type of yarn: super fine (thinnest type of yarn), fine, light, medium, bulky, and super bulky (thickest type of yarn).,
Get the appropriate knitting needles.,
Get a yarn needle (or tapestry needle).,
Put all of your new knitting accessories in a serious knitter's tote to keep them all together.",How to Gather the Things You Need to Start Knitting," It's easy to go overboard and buy tons of yarn and needles, but since you're just starting out, better to be on the cautious side.;
, The reason for this is, for example, if you are making a large purse, you would need the yarn to be medium to super bulky. So to make the rest of the long story short, the size of your yarn depends on the size of the project. To start out choose basic yarn, nothing frilly or textured. This will be easiest to knit with for a beginner. Medium to bulky weights will be easy to see and easy to manipulate as well.

, Now, you might be saying, ""Oh, I can just use my chopsticks! Why do I have to spend extra money on some sticks?"". Well, you are a bit wrong. You will soon find that knitting with chopsticks is very frustrating, as your stitches will slip off the end and get stuck in the wood. For your first needles consider:



Size: Make sure you match your needles (within one size) to your yarn. Read the label on the yarn you select and buy the needle size it suggests. Otherwise you will end up with extremely holy or extremely tight yarn. It's good to start out with size eight or large needles, because thicker yarn is easier to start with.

Material: You will only gain a preference after you try lots of needles. To start out, try plastic or wooden or bamboo needles. The stitches will tend to stay on these needles, unlike metal which they will slip off easily. (This is a problem for beginning knitters everywhere...)

Type: Mostly likely you are starting out with a two dimensional, flat knitting project as a beginner. For this you will need straight needles (two sticks). Steer clear of the circular needles and double pointed needles for now.

, ""What is a yarn needle?"" you may ask. Well, a yarn needle is a small needle that you use to weave in extra thread that hangs off of your finished project. They are cheap, and will help finished project to look neater, and more professional. If you don't buy yarn needles, you can cut them with scissors, but this will leave a small piece of yarn sticking out from where you cut with the scissors. It's your choice!

, This way whenever you want to go somewhere and bring your knitting, it's all in one place. You may want to include:


A small cloth bag to keep doodads in such as yarn needles. (A plastic bag will get poked to shreds.)
A folder for patterns and yarn labels.
Large Ziploc bags for keeping knitting projects separate.

Add a button.,
Use your roll up.",How to Sew a Knitting Needle Roll Up2," The fabric pieces need to be 13 inches (33.02 centimeters) wide and 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) longer than your longest knitting needle.Choose a nice print for the outside. You can use cotton, twill, linen, or even canvas for this.
Choose a solid color for the inside/lining. The best fabric for this would be cotton.

, You can use the same color as you did for your lining, or you can choose a different color. Consider using cotton; your roll up will have lots of layers, so the thinner the fabric is, the easier it will be to sew. Here are the dimensions for the pockets:Back pocket: 13 by 13 inches (33.02 by 33.02 centimeters)
Front pocket: 13 by 8 inches (33.02 by 20.32 centimeters)
If you are working with double-pointed needles, consider cutting a 13 by 8-inch (cc by cc-centimeter) strip for the top flap. This will help protect the points.

, You will end up with a 13 by 6.5-inch (33.02 by 16.51-centimeter) strip, and one a 13 by 4-inch (cc by cc-inch) strip. If you are making a top flap for your roll up, then you should fold it in half as well.


You won't be turning the pockets inside out, so make sure that the right side of the fabric is on the outside.
Use a heat setting on your iron that is suitable for the fabric that you are working with.

, Take the large piece of fabric that you will be using for the outside of your roll up, and turn it so that the right side is facing you. Place the big pocket down first, so that both of the long, raw edges align with each other. The pocket's folded edge should be facing towards the middle. Place the smaller pocket on top. Again, make sure that the bottom, raw edges align. Pin everything in place.


If you are adding a top flap, position it along the top of the outside piece. Make sure that the long, raw edges align, and that the folded edge is facing towards the middle.

, The first and last lines should be ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) from the side edge. The rest of the lines should be 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) apart. You can use a tailor's chalk or washable pen for this.


You are drawing the lines straight down from the top edge of the back pocket all the way down to the bottom of the roll up.
If you usually work with skinny needles, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) may be enough for you. If you work with thick needles, 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) may work better.
If you added a top flat, leave it alone.

, Backstitch a few times at the front and start of your sewing to prevent the thread from unraveling. You can skip sewing across the first and last line. Because they are ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the side edge, they will be covered up by the regular stitching.


You can use any color you want for the thread. You can match it to the pockets, or you can use a contrasting color.
You are sewing the lines now so that they won't be visible once you put the roll up together.

, Find the middle of the right side edge of your roll up, and pin it in place. Make sure that the cut edges of the elastic are aligned with the raw edge of the fabric; it's okay if a little bit of the elastic sticks out from under the fabric, however.


Choose a thin piece of elastic. Something that is around ¼-inch (0.64 centimeters) wide would be ideal. If it is too thick, it won't loop around the button you'll be adding later.

, Make sure that all of the edges and corners align. The pockets, top flap (if you are using it), and elastic should all be sandwiched between the lining and outside piece of fabric.


At this point, you can move all of the pins you used earlier, and use them to pin everything together.

, Use a ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) seam allowance. Position the gap just above the large/back pocket. It does not have to be exactly 3 inches (7.62 centimeters), but it should be wide enough so that you can turn the roll up inside out. Remove the pins as you sew.

, Clipping the corners will help reduce bulk and bunching. Try to get as close to the stitching as you can without actually cutting through the thread. Once you have turned the fabric inside out, use a long, slender tool (such as a chopstick or knitting needle) to help push the corners out.

, Fold the edges of the gap in, so that they align with the rest of the roll up, then secure it with sewing pins. Iron the roll up flat, focusing on the corners and edges.

, Position the roll up so that the outside is facing you. This way, the pockets won't get caught on the foot of the sewing machine. Use a thread color that matches the outside of the fabric. Remove any sewing pins as you sew.


If you want to get fancier, pin some bias tape all the way around the edges of the roll up. Sew as close as you can to the inside edge of the bias tape. Position both ends of the tape to either side of the elastic.

, Find a large button that you like, and sew it on right next to the elastic. Try to sew only through the top layer of fabric; this way, when you open up your roll up, you won't see the stitching from the inside., Insert the shorter needles into the front pockets, and the larger needles into the back. Roll the fabric up, starting from the plain edge, working your way towards the elastic and button. Wrap the elastic around the bundle, then loop it around the button.


If you added a top flap, tuck the ends of the needles under it.
If you like to crochet, you can use the front pocket to store your crochet hooks.

, You can use a stockinette stitch or a garter stitch. The stockinette stitch is alternating rows of knits and purls. It is knit on one side, and bumpy on the other. The garter stitch is knitting on each row. It will give you a bumpy texture on both sides.

, Once you reach the end of the row, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Set the yarn aside, and pick up your accent color. The accent colors are as listed below:

Gryffindor: Gold
Hufflepuff: Black
Ravenclaw: Bronze (books) or Silver (films)
Slytherin: Silver(films)

, Use the same stitch as you did for your main house color: stockinette or garter. Be sure to leave behind a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail when you start knitting., Once you reach the end of the second row, cut your accent color down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Pick up your accent color., Once again, leave a 4 to 6-inch (10.16 to 15.24-centimeter) tail at the start of the first row and the end of the second one. This will create a distinctive double-stripe seen on the house scarves in the later films.

, Most scarves are about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long. Repeat the pattern listed below:


20 rows in your main color
2 rows in your accent color
2 rows in your main color
2 rows in your accent color

, Knit two stitches onto your right needle. Use your left needle to pull the first stitch over the second stitch. Slip that first stitch of off your right needle. Keep knitting a stitch, then using your knitting needle to pull the previous stitch off the needle. Stop when you have one stitch left., Once you reach the of the row and have one stitch left, cut your yarn down to 4 to 6 inches (10.16 to 15.24 centimeters). Thread it through the last stitch, then back through the loop. Make a tight knot, then use a yarn needle or a tapestry needle to weave the tail back into the scarf. Trim off any excess yarn., Go back over your scarf where you had the color changes. Tie the tail ends together, then weave them back into the body of the scarf. You can do this with a yarn needle or a tapestry needle. Trim off any excess yarn., Wrap some yarn around your palm three times. Cut the excess yarn off, then snip the bottom of the loop. Use a crochet hook to pull the folded part of all three strands through the bottom corner of your scarf. Pull the tail end of the strands through the loop. Tug on the tail ends to tighten them. This makes one tassel.You can match the tassels to the stripe you are weaving them into. You can also use the other color.
Consider alternating the tassels between your two house colors. Space the tassels about 2 stitches apart.

Slytherin: Green and Silver

, The strips need to be 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide and 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) long.You will need 9 to 10 strips of each color.

, Pin the strips with the right sides facing together, the long edges touching. When you are done, you should have a long strip that is 9 inches (22.86 centimeters) wide and about 60 inches (152.4 centimeters) long., Pull out the pins as you sew.

, Use an iron to go over each of the seams you just made, and press them open. This will help reduce bulk for your scarf., Make sure that the wrong sides are sticking out and the right sides are sticking on. Pin the scarf along the edges, if necessary., Use a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance.Start sewing at the bottom of the second stripe, and stop sewing at the top of the second to last stripe. Do not sew across the narrow ends of the scarf.

Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing to keep the stitching from coming undone.
Trim off the tail ends of the thread.

, Cut some slits into the first and last stripes, ½-inch (1.27-centimeters) apart. Try to cut through both layers of fabric. When you reach the folded edge, simply cut it apart., Make sure that you get all of the fringes out as well. For a neater finish, press the scarf flat with an iron. Focus on the side edges., Sew across the top of the first stripe, and the bottom of the last stripe. Use a thread and bobbin color that matches the fabric."

Make sure that you're holding the needles in the most comfortable way for you.,

Don't pull too hard on your supply of yarn.,

Use knitting needles of an appropriate size for the yarn.,

Use a knitting needle material that is suited to the yarn you are using.,

Use yarns that are slippery and at least a little stretchy.,

Try circular needles.,

Introduce a bit of something to help the yarn slide on the needles.",How to Improve the Handling of Knitting Needles," There are a number of different ways to hold knitting needles and if you have been taught only one way but you've always found it uncomfortable, liberate yourself by trying a different holding method and seeing whether your comfort level improves.

The most common method for holding knitting needles is to hold the left hand needle with your left hand down about 2"" (5cm) from the needle's point, similar to the way in which you'd hold a pencil to sharpen it. Then, hold the other needle in your right hand much like holding a pen. (Switch this around if you're left handed.);
, Wrapping the needles too tightly with yarn will make it harder to slide the stitches. This is partly a matter of practice and experience, so don't give up if your first few attempts at knitting seem a bit snug., Yarn labels typically suggest an appropriate size of needles for the yarn inside. While this is a suggestion and not a hard and fast rule, the yarn and needle size should be compatible.

Use a needle gauge to check the size of your knitting needles if they are not marked or you're not sure.

, Needles come in many materials, including wood, bamboo, plastic, ivory (antique), and metal. Try different needle materials with different yarns and see which combinations you like the most., Certain materials, such as cotton and some synthetics, don't slip on the needles as well as other yarn. You can still knit with these materials, but they may tend to tighten up more and slide less freely., It's easier to keep the work from slipping off of them when they're not in use.

Relax circular needles if they have been coiled too tightly for too long. If your circular needles are pulling back because they have been coiled up in storage, hold them in the steam from a teakettle or direct a hair dryer at them to loosen them up.

, Use cornstarch as a dry lubricant, spray with a dry silicone lubricant, or wax them with car wax or beeswax and buff with a dry cloth. Run the tips through your hair now and then."

Organize and size all your double pointed needles.,

Gather the materials listed below.,
Cut the sheet protector just under its hole punches.,

Tape the original opening of the sheet protector.,



 Use one of these if needed.,

Place the pockets.,

Staple on the creases.,
Place the needles in each pocket to test them out.,Prepare additional sheet protectors as above if needed.,

Write the needle size and any other pertinent information in permanent marker on the pockets.,



Fasten the pockets to the bottom of the hanger using the twist ties.",How to Make a Double Pointed Knitting Needle Holder on a Budget," For the best results, use a knitting needle gauge. Place all needles of the same type, length, and size next to each other. If your double pointed needles are all sized and sorted, you may skip this step.
, Make sure you have enough sheet protectors for your needles. Depending on the size of your needle collection, you may need more than one sheet protector., To do this, hold the sheet protector so that the hole punched section is on top and the original opening is to the left. Cut through one layer of the plastic sheet just under the hole punched section. When you are done, you should get a sheet protector that is open on two adjacent sides., Do it neatly as possible. When one is done, one should have a sheet protector that is open only on the side that is next to the hole punches.,

Cut and tape the bottom of the sheet protector if needed. If your needles are very short, you may have to cut the bottom of the sheet protector to fit your needles. Cut both layers this time, and tape up both sides. If you take this route, you should have two taped edges, one original edge, and one open edge., Measure out each pocket and make a crease where each pocket should go. Use the straight edges of the sheet protector to make sure that your pockets are straight., You may have to fold over the existing pockets accordion style so that the stapler arm can reach the inside pockets., If the pocket is way to big or too small, you might be able to fit another set of needles or other notions in the pocket.,, See the images in the next step for a close-up of this step., You can put more than one sheet protector per hanger, but be careful not to overload the hanger. The one in the example has two sets of pockets, one in the front and one in the back. It holds a full set of eight inch double-pointed needles in sizes 4-11."
"
Use metal needles.,
Try plastic needles for a budget option.,
Look into wooden needles.,
Get a pair of bamboo needles.",How to Choose Knitting Needles1," Metal needles are the classic type of needle and they come in many different sizes. Many knitters enjoy using metal needles because you can work quickly with them and because of the clicking sound they make while you are using them. However, if you are not concerned with knitting speed and/or find the clicking sound annoying, then metal needles might not be the best option for you.Most metal needles are made of aluminum, but you can also find metal needles that are made from nickel or brass.;
, Plastic needles are the most inexpensive knitting needle option, so this is a great choice if you are looking for a budget option or if you are just trying out knitting to see if you like it. You can also find plastic needles in extra-large sizes that other needles are not available in, so these may be a good option for knitting projects that require using a super bulky yarn or uncommon materials.Keep in mind that the yarn will easily slide off of plastic needles while you are working with it, which can be a bonus for speed knitting, or frustrating if you drop a stitch!

, Wooden needles are some of the most expensive, but many knitters prefer the feel of wooden needles.Wooden needles are also nice for beginner knitters because the stitches will not slide off of the needles as easily as with metal or plastic needles., If you like the feel of wooden needles but find them too expensive, then bamboo needles are a less expensive alternative to wooden needles.Bamboo needles offer knitters a similar feel to wooden needles and the texture of the needles helps the yarn to stay on the needles rather than slipping off them.

"
"
Use straight needles.,
Experiment with circular needles.,
Try double pointed needles.,
Make cables with a cable needle.,
Look into interchangeable sets.",How to Choose Knitting Needles2," Straight needles are the kind that have pointed tips and a flat, wide end or knob to keep the stitches from slipping off.These are best for projects that you want to work in rows, such as scarves, blankets, and washcloths. They come in many different sizes and in different lengths as well, so you can find a pair to suit your project.


Straight needles usually come in 7”, 10”, 12”, and 14” lengths., Circular needles have a wire or nylon cord that extends between two needles. They are best for working projects in the round, such as hats, infinity scarves, and sweaters. However, you can also use them to hold all of the stitches for a larger project that you want to work in rows, such as a blanket.Circular needles come in many different sizes and with different lengths of wire or nylon cord extending between the needles. Some common circular needles wire lengths include 16”, 20”, 24”, and 32”., Double pointed needles (DPNs) are often necessary for binding off projects like hats, which you would mostly work on a pair of circular needles. Double pointed needles are also great for smaller circular projects, such as socks and mittens. You can get double pointed needles in many different sizes.


Double pointed needles come in sets of four or five needles.You may want to get a set of needle point covers if you plan to use double pointed needles. Stitches can easily slip off the ends of double pointed needles, especially if you are using metal or plastic ones. Place a needle point cover over one end or both ends of the needles while you work to avoid dropping a stitch.

, Cable needles are ""U"" shaped needles. If you are interested in trying cabling, then you will need a cable needle. However, keep in mind that a cable needle is not something you can use on its own. You will need to use a cable needle in conjunction with a pair of straight, circular, or double pointed needles to make cables.


Cable needles come in lots of different sizes as well. Make sure to get a cable needle that matches your other knitting needles for the project.

, If you think you might want to work with a variety of knitting needles, then you might want to get an interchangeable set. Interchangeable sets include a variety of needle types that you can connect in different ways to use for your projects. You can attach different lengths of wire between circular needles or use extenders to make longer straight needles as needed.Keep in mind that these sets can be expensive, but it may be less expensive than buying all of the different needle types and sizes that you might use.

"
"
Check your pattern.,
Look at the yarn label.,
Test the gauge.",How to Choose Knitting Needles3," When trying to decide on a knitting needle size, it is best to begin by consulting the knitting pattern you are using. Knitting patterns will usually specify the size and type of needle required for a project. If multiple needle types and sizes are required, then these should all be listed on the pattern.


Always check before you get started and stick to the pattern’s recommendations to ensure that you get the best result possible.

, If you are not following a pattern, then the next best place to look for a needle size recommendation is on the label of your yarn. Most yarn labels include a size recommendation for knitting needles and crochet hooks. Check the label and look for a written or illustrated recommendation.Sometimes the labels will have written recommendation, such as “Knitting needles size 8,” while other times you will just see a pair of knitting needles with a number inside the illustration. This number is the size you need to get.
Keep in mind that there are American and European sizes. American knitting needle sizes are listed as whole numbers on labels, and European sizes are listed as a millimeter measurement, such as “9mm.”, Gauge is the number of stitches you knit per inch with a specific type of yarn and pair of needles.If you are not sure what size knitting needles to use, but you have a few pairs and some yarn, then you can always knit a gauge swatch to help you decide.


To knit a gauge swatch, knit a square that is four inches by four inches with your yarn and needles. Then, check the look of the stitches and see if this is the ideal needle size for your project, or if it might look better with a smaller or larger pair of needles.

, Knit stitch works well for beginners––knit even rows, purl odd rows. You can vary the number of rows as you go.

, You'll need to gauge the final length from the stitch used by making a sample piece of about 15 stitches and measuring its gauge. This tells you how many stitches fit for each 5cm/2 inches, allowing you to calculate the final length desired.

Choose your knitting needles.,
Pick out your yarn.,
Grab your extras.,
Measure your head.",How to Knit an Easy Hat1," They come in all sorts of different sizes and determine the look of your stitch. A circular knitting needle will be easiest for this project.









US #8 is pretty standard. Anything up to size 10 will be fine.
You may use double-pointed needles, but those are typically easier for smaller items, like socks. A circular needle is best and will be assumed for the purpose of this article.
A darning needle or crochet hook is needed for finishing your work.;
, Have a style of hat in mind before you go about selecting your yarn. You should only need one ball; choose one of a reasonable thickness.









Cotton is less stretchy and not as warm as wool.
If you're a beginner, avoid a thin, skinny yarn. Thicker ones are much easier to work with and take less time.
Check the yardage on the ball so you know you have enough for your finished product.

If you're using a bulky weight yarn, you'll need between 125 and 200 yards (115 and 183 meters); if a worsted weight yarn, between 150 and 300 (137 and 275 meters).



, You'll need a few more things before you get started.









Scissors
Stitch markers (safety pins work fine)
Measuring tape

, Don't skip this part! Knowing how many stitches to knit is necessary for a hat that perfectly fits your head. The last thing you want is a doll-sized hat or a hat for a bucket.










If you're giving this as a gift, the average adult head is around 22 inches in circumference (56 cm).


Knit a swatch. Take note of how many stitches there are per inch.
Multiply the measurement of your head by the number of stitches needed per inch. (example: 21 inches x 4 stitches per inch = 84 stitches.) This is the number of stitches you will need at the base.
You may want to round down to a number divisible by eight; this will make it easier to reduce later, for the top of your hat.

Rounding down is safer than rounding up; yarn stretches easier than it shrinks.



"
"
Cast on.,
Join your cast on stitches in the round.,
Keep knitting.",How to Knit an Easy Hat2," This is where the math you just did comes in handy. Cast on the amount of stitches needed for the base of your head (84 in the previous example).









If you've never knitted or knitted in the round before, learn how to knit first and do some research online.

, The circular knitting needle makes this ultra-easy to do.









Be careful not to twist! Twisted rounds cannot be fixed; if you're not careful, you'll have to start completely over. What you end up with will not resemble a hat.

, Around and around and around you go! Try your hat on at different times to gauge how many more rounds you should make.









The circular needles create a brim that rolls automatically. Because of this, you'll need to knit for a bit longer to account for the lost length.

Start decreasing.,
Cut your yarn.,
Remove the needle.,
Hide the excess yarn.,
Finished!",How to Knit an Easy Hat3," If done well, this part will leave your hat snug on your head. If you're unfamiliar with decreasing, stop now and do some research online.









Place stitch markers every 8 stitches.
When at 2 stitches before the marker, decrease (a fancy term for knitting two stitches together at once).
Continue this pattern, decreasing every round.
After decreasing for a bit, you'll notice your hat getting smaller and smaller. Don't be afraid to adjust your needles accordingly; this won't mess up your work.

, When you have just 4 stitches left on your needle, you're ready. Snip off more than enough to work with in finishing the hat, about 15-20 inches (38-50 cm).








, Take a darning needle or crochet hook and pull the loose yarn through your remaining 4 stitches one at a time. This will tighten the top of your hat.









After you've pulled the loose yarn through each stitch on the needle, slide the needle out.

, Grab the loose end and pull it down through the top of the hat with your crochet hook. The end should end up at the underside/inside of the hat.









Cut it down to about a few inches. Weave in the end using a darning needle down the length of your hat. This will remain secure and tight and hide the seam.
You can also hide the starting tail end by weaving it through the hat as well.

, Enjoy your knitted hat!

This article will teach you how to switch between different balls of yarn as you knit. Note that this method is not required to knit a scarf - you can keep the same color for the whole scarf and skip the steps about switching if you like.
To achieve a multicolored look without switching yarns, try a variegated yarn that incorporates several different colors.
Have 200 yards (182.9 m) of yarn at your disposal.
Bigger needles create a looser stitch; smaller needles, a tighter one. Choose the size according to your desired look. For worsted weight yarn, size 8 to 10 needles are normally used.;
, You may wind up knitting for hours, so make sure you're in a comfortable chair and sitting position.


Make sure you're in a well-lit area and can move your arms and needles freely.

,









If you are a beginner knitter, you should make a relatively small scarf, enough to keep you warm, but avoid making it so wide that it takes too long to knit.
If you are knitting with worsted weight yarn and size 8 to 10 needles, you'll need to cast on 30 to 40 stitches for a nice-sized scarf.

, Remember that you do not have to knit another color if you do not want to, and you do not have to knit the other color immediately, either.









You can knit to this point, then put it down, and return later or tomorrow to continue. This is what makes knitting so great. Never leave your knitting in the middle of a row, or it will pull funny.

, Make sure to leave a 6-inch tail.









If you choose not to have a second color, then skip this step and just continue knitting in the one color all the way to the end.

If you plan to make a single-colored scarf, check the dye lot listed on the yarn label. Make sure to get the same dye lot to avoid manufacturing variations in color. (If you are buying one ball of each color, you do not need to worry about the dye lot.)



, This will make your scarf look professional and coordinate with more outfits.









Align the end of the tail of the first color with the beginning of the second color of yarn. Hold them together in your left hand, away from the thread of the new color that you'll be knitting.

, Knit about 5 stitches and stop to pull on the ends.








, Later, you'll weave them into the scarf with a tapestry needle or crochet hook.


Never tie knots to change colors when you are knitting. You can usually see them, and it makes it difficult to correct mistakes.

, Follow the same process you did with the first color.








, Follow the instructions given above for adding the second color yarn. Cut the yarn with your scissors and again leave a 6-inch tail.









You can do this as many times as you like! You can also have smaller or larger sections if you prefer to have a dominant color.

, Make sure to maintain focus and not go on autopilot--you could drop a stitch inadvertently.









Keep alternating colors as instructed, doing 12 rows of each, until the scarf reaches a desired length. The scarf, when finished, will have a pattern of three different colors.

, Wrap your scarf around your neck and admire your own handiwork. Feels good, doesn't it?









Use a crochet hook to weave your loose string into your scarf, hiding the end. A knot can be seen and look a little haphazard.

, Do this to all of the pegs. As you pull the yarn up and over, slide the loop that remains back down to the base of the peg.








, Each time, you make a row of knitting for the hat. The knitting will hang down the middle of the loom. The bottom row is your first row of knitting.








, This step is optional, but it gives the hat a nice finished look. The brim will be half as long as your knitting to this point and will be a double thickness of knitting.









Reach through the middle and bring the very first row of knitting up and onto the pegs, essentially ""folding"" a brim. There will be two strands between stitches. These are the two strands you want to place on the peg. Repeat for all the stitches.
Use the hook to pull the bottom loop up over the top two strands. Repeat for all pegs. After forming the brim, continue knitting the rest of the hat as above. The first row after the brim bring both strands up and over the new loop for every peg.

Consider buying extra-soft baby yarn, but know that you do not have to buy a yarn that is specifically made for babies.
Know what yarn weight you need. Most baby items are made from lighter weight yarn, either “superfine” (1) or “fine” (2). ;
, Remember that not all parents want pink for a girl or blue for a boy. Consider a gender neutral color or primary color.









Consider choosing a variegated baby yarn instead of a solid color. There are also some new yarns that form a pattern as you knit.

, Many baby hat patterns require size 6 (4mm) needles.









Start with straight needles if you are just beginning to knit. Circular needles are generally used by more advanced knitters.
Determine how big your needles need to be. The needle size determines how big the loops are in your hat, and the wrong needles may lead to the hat being the wrong size. Note that there are metric and US sizes, so you may need to convert the size. , Casting on is the way that you begin your knitting by creating a row of loops on one of your needles. See How to Knit for step-by-step instructions for casting on.









Cast on 60 loops (if using 4mm needles) (more if the hat is not for a newborn).
Hold your needles so that the left needle has the knitting on it, the needle points are facing away from you, and the yarn is leaving the needle to the right, on the bottom side of the needle.

, This will probably be about 50 rows if you’re using a fine baby yarn.









Hold the needle with the cast-on loops in your left hand and pass the needle in your right hand through the stitch and behind your left needle.
Wrap a loop of yarn counter-clockwise around the right needle point.
Pull the right needle off through the stitch on the left side, and push the top stitch off of the left needle.
Each knit stitch will add one loop to the needle on the right and remove one from the needle on the left. When you finish a row, change the needles to your other hands so that you start each row with the knitting on the left needle.
Be sure your knitting trails to the right as you are knitting, towards the (at first) empty needle.

, After knitting for about 5 inches, begin to decrease the length of your knitting.








Instead of going through one stitch with your right needle, go through two stitches.
Continue the 2-stitch decrease until you have only one loop left on your needle.

, Be sure to leave yourself a nice long tail of yarn for sewing the sides of the hat together. Tie the tail in a simple knot where it leaves the knitting before you begin to stitch with it.








, Use a large sewing needle or a bobby pin, sew the hat sides together. Weave the excess yarn in and out along the two sides. Tie off the end and cut off the remaining tail.








, The stitched seam should be on the inside, where it won’t be seen.








, Wrap it nicely or include it in a display that includes other practical baby items, such as on top of a “diaper cake.”

",How to Knit With Double Pointed Needles," It's easiest to work with a number of stitches that is divisible by three.;
,,, Move the needle in your left hand (i.e.: at the other end) to the tip of the needle that is in your right hand.

, Make sure all the stitches are facing the same way. Take your fourth needle and begin knitting and/or purling so that all the stitches become connected.








, You then move on to the next needle, and so on. Make sure to knit the first two stitches after switching needles very tightly. Otherwise you will end up with loose ladders where you change needles.








, Knit and/or purl a few rounds; there should be a tube forming.

"
Note that every pattern has the specific tension instructions.,
Always work to the correct tension specified.,
Always knit a tension square for practice before starting your project.",How to Understand Tension in Knitting," Usually the tension will be written in a box on the pattern.;
, This ensures that the item will be of the correct size and appearance, rather than sloppy, lopsided, or misshapen. This will also prevent kitten-sized sweaters or refrigerator-size socks!

, This will show any problems before it is too late. For example, if the tension square is smaller than the one specified, then your needles are too small and you must find thicker needles. Equally, if your tension square is larger than the one specified, your needles are too large and you will need to replace with thinner ones.

Weave the free yarn into your stitches.",How to Knit a Beanie," Yarns come in a variety of “weights,” meaning some yarns are thin and delicate while others are chunky and thick.The thinner the yarn, the more stitches you have to knit to create a length of fabric. The lightest weight — ""fingering"" — would call for a lot of yarn and time to create a simple hat. This pattern calls for a nice medium-weight yarn: ""worsted"" yarn.


Look on the yarn's packaging for the weight. ""Worsted"" yarn is signified by the number 4.
Remember to choose an appropriate fiber. You probably wouldn't want to wear a hat made out of something itchy and uncomfortable! Cotton, acrylic, and wools, or blends of these fibers are all good choices.
Make sure to choose a color you'll enjoy and won't mind wearing.
Cheaper yarns can be rough and uncomfortable, so make sure to give the yarn a touch-test before buying it. To accurately test how it will feel on your head, test it by touching the yarn to the inside of your arm, or to your neck. Simply feeling it with your hands may not suffice.
You'll need about 200 yards for this pattern. This should be about one skein of yarn, depending on the brand you choose.;
, Each yarn weight calls for a different sized knitting needle. The yarn’s packaging will tell you what size needle you should use. For worsted yarn, like we’re using in this pattern, the Craft Yarn Council recommends using needles sized from 7-9.For this pattern, we’ll split the middle and use size 8 needles.


When you think of needles, you might think of two separate sticks. But, “knitting in the round” (making a tube fabric like a beanie or sock) calls for circular needles.
Circular needles are attached by a length of plastic, so your stitches are always in the same place instead of being split up between two different needles.
Circular needles come in different lengths, too. For a hat, choose a 16"" size 8 needle. If the plastic connector is too much longer than 16"", it will get in the way of your knitting.

, You run out of stitches and have to flip your knitting over. On circular needles, though, you never ""run out of stitches."" To keep track of where each row begins and ends, buy a stitch marker.


A stitch marker is usually a small, circular piece of plastic. You'll slip it onto your needle when you've finished casting on your stitches.
When you're knitting each row, you'll know you've come back to where you began when you reach the stitch marker.

, You’ll likely have scissors just laying around your house, buy you might need to buy a tapestry needle from a craft store. A tapestry needle is just like a sewing needle, but the eye is wide enough to allow yarn through. You'll use them to sew in the ends of the yarn when you finish the hat.

, You should always gauge the yarn to see how much fabric you'll actually produce. In gauging, you'll find out how many stitches it takes to create an inch of fabric with your combination of yarn and needles. Make sure it matches the pattern you're working from, or else adjust the number of stitches you make per row. Make sure your hat will be the right size.


Cast on 20 stitches.
Knit 26 rows.
Using a ruler, see how many stitches are in one-inch of the fabric swatch you've made.
For this pattern, 20 stitches knitted for 26 rows should create a 4"" x 4"" swatch of fabric.

, Casting on is the first step in knitting. It can be a difficult process to describe with words, and there are a wide variety of techniques. You should look up videos online if you’re not familiar with the process.Create a slip knot and slide it onto one of the needles. The loop should be less-than-snug around the needle. If the loop is too tight, you’ll have trouble slipping the other needle into the stitch.
Cast on a total of 80 stitches for this pattern.

, Once you’ve cast on your initial stitches, you want to make sure you don't forget where those 80 stitches begin and end. Place a stitch marker over the tip of the needle holding the stitches.


Every time you come to the marker in the course of your knitting, you know you've completed another row of 80 stitches.
Transfer the marker from one needle to the other, then continue knitting as usual.
The stitch marker becomes very important when you're shaping the crown of your hat. Make sure you don't lose track of it or let it fall off the needle while you're knitting.

, The first ten rows will create the “brim” of your beanie. You’ll knit these rows in a different pattern from the rest of the hat. These rows will follow a *k2, p2* pattern.


This means that you will ""knit"" two stitches, then ""purl"" two stitches for the entire row of 80 stitches.
Since 80 is divisible by 4, you shouldn't have any stitches left over at the end of each row.

, An extra row here or there likely won't make a big difference in a simple hat like this, but it's good practice to track your rows. In more complex patterns, like socks or gloves, losing count of your rows can ruin your entire project.


If you have trouble remembering, keep a running tally on a piece of paper.
Make sure to transfer the stitch marker at the end of each row to help you keep track.

, Once you’ve completed your brim, you want to switch to a different pattern to mark the difference. For the rest of your hat, follow this pattern:


Knit odd rows (11, 13, 15, etc.) all the way around in pure knit stitches.
Knit even rows (12, 14, 16, etc.) in a *k1, p1* pattern. This means that you will knit one stitch, then purl one stitch until you reach the end of the row.

, You don't need to count rows any more at this point. Keep knitting until the tube of fabric you're creating measure about 9-10"" from the ""cast-on"" edge to the edge that's still on needles.


Again, make sure to keep track of your stitch marker. Even if you're not counting rows right now, you'll need to know where rows begin in the next stage of the project.
If you want a slouchier hat, you might add a little more length. You can slip the unfinished hat over your head to see how much length you prefer.
Make sure not to let any stitches slide off the needles when trying on the hat.

, The “crown” of the hat is the part that start getting smaller as it reaches the end of the beanie. To make the rows shorter, you have to “decrease” how many stitches are in each row. To do this, knitters use a K2tog. This means that you knit 2 stitches together into a single stitch, decreasing the amount of stitches in that row.


Instead of slipping your needle into the first stitch, start with the second stitch. Slide your needle through both loops, treating them as a single knit stitch.
Wrap the yarn around and complete the knit stitch as usual. You've now decreased the number of stitches in that row by 1.

, This will create a dramatic decrease in the size of your hat’s “tube,” and is better for longer, slouchier hats than fitted hats. When you reach the stitch marker, transfer it and move on to your next row's pattern.

, You don’t want to decrease too sharply all at once, or your hat will end too abruptly. To create a gentler slope, you want to alternate your decreasing rows with knit rows.

, K2tog on odd-numbered rows and knit around on even-numbered rows. When you’ve completed your fifth row, you’re almost finished with your hat!


Because of your decreases, you should only have 10 stitches left on your needles when you finish the fifth row of your beanie’s crown.

, You want to leave a nice long tail so you can weave it into your stitches and finish your hat. You should have plenty of yarn left over in your skein, so cut a one-foot tail to be on the safe side.


Remove and store your stitch marker at this point. You don’t need it anymore for this project.

, Thread the tail of the yarn through your tapestry needle. Slip the needle into each of the remaining 10 stitches, pulling the free end of the yarn through the stitches. You should slide each stitch off the needle, onto the free tail. When you’re finished, all the stitches should be off the needles, and you should have some yarn left over hanging loose.

, There will be a small hole at the center of the 10 stitches. Pull the free tail to tighten up the end of the hat and draw the stitches close. The hole should be drawn into a pinpoint.

, Turn the hat inside out, then weave the tapestry needle through your stitches to secure the free end of the yarn. This is called “weaving in the ends” of the yarn. When you’re sure that the yarn won’t come loose and unravel your hat, cut the rest of the tail off with scissors.


Do the same thing to the free yarn at the brim of the hat, where you cast on your original stitches.

",How to Knit on Circular Needles,";
,, Do which ever cast on method you like. It's recommended that you do not use the backwards loop method, as the loops can twist around and come undone.








, Make sure all of your stitches are straight on the needles and facing the same direction.








, What this means is you need to join the knitting yarn to the work so it is one continuous circle. Hold the needle where the cast on began in your left hand and hold the other needle in your right hand. Begin knitting with the working yarn, making sure you are connecting the yarn to the beginning and creating a circle.








, Otherwise you may have a ladder form where you joined the yarn, and you don't want that to happen.

, (If you don't have a stitch marker you can use a paper clip.) This is not completely necessary, as you can see where the round starts with the tail yarn, but it's very helpful if you're knitting a complex pattern.

, A tube like structure should begin to form.

Understand that if you are picking up stitches from the cast-on row or cast-off row (the first or last row of knitted work), the top of the row will consist of slip stitches.,

Knit a gauge swatch.,
Measure the gauge swatch with a ruler.,
If you cast on a different number of stitches than the number recommended for your pattern gauge, you will need to count your stitches.,
Know that if the number of stitches or rows per inch does not match what the pattern specifies, you will probably need to experiment with different needle sizes.",How to Knit a Gauge Swatch1," This is a rectangle of knitted fabric used to ensure that your finished garment will be the size you intended. Some patterns require that you wash and block (or shape while damp) your swatch before measuring--this is important because some yarns will change gauge after washing and blocking. Wash the swatch the same way you plan to wash the finished item.;
, Hold or pin it down flat--don't stretch it or scrunch it. If you cast on the number of stitches specified in the pattern, it should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) on each side, forming an even square (the corners should make right angles, the square shouldn't be crooked).

, Count the stitches and rows per inch. In the gauge swatch shown, there are 8 stitches and 6 rows. It can be difficult at first to count the stitches and rows correctly, depending on the type of stitch your knitting the gauge swatch with, but in stockinette stitch, each v when counting across is a stitch and each v counting down is a row. Avoid counting the edges. How many stitches are there per inch? And how many rows per inch? Multiply the number of stitches per one inch by four--then you'll know if you have the correct number of stitches per four inches, as specified in the pattern.

, If you need more stitches or rows per inch, use smaller needles. If you need less, use bigger needles. Every time you try a new set of needles, knit a new gauge swatch to test them. You can also adjust your gauge by changing the type of yarn you use (thinner yarn if you need more stitches or rows, thicker yarn if you need less) but this is usually inconvenient and should not be necessary if you purchased yarn similar to what was recommended.

Understand that if you are picking up stitches from the selvedge, or the edge created by the first stitch and last stitch of each row, you will be given the number of stitches to pick up.,
Place stitch holders at even intervals along the edge, and divide the number of stitches you need to pick up by the number of markers.,
Working one stitch in from the edge, or where the stitches are neater, insert your needle through one leg of the stitch, and knit into that loop.,
Continue in this manner along your entire edge, spacing your stitches evenly.

If you have about 1 stitch more per inch (2.5 cm) than the pattern, try again with a larger needle.,
If you have about 1 stitch fewer per inch (2.5 cm) than the pattern, try again with a smaller needle.,
Begin your project with the yarn and needles that matched the pattern gauge.

",How to Measure Knit Gauge," It is usually at the beginning of the pattern, along with the type of yarn and size of knitting needle to use.;
, For example, a teddy bear will turn out fine even if a bit bigger or smaller than the pattern instructions, while gloves need to be sized exactly so they fit the wearer.

, For a project with leeway, a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch can suffice, but otherwise, you want a sample of 6 to 8 inches (15-20 cm).

, Use stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl next row) for measuring knit gauge, unless the pattern's listed gauge specifically says to work the sample in another pattern, such as a seed stitch.


When making a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch, use stockinette or the listed stitch for making the entire sample. (If no stitch is listed, the listed gauge refers to stockinette stitch.) The end result will be an approximation, because stitch tension functions differently on edges than in the midst of a fabric.
When making a swatch of 6 to 8 inches(15-20 cm), work in the garter stitch for the first several rows until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) as border. After that, begin and end each row with an inch (2.5 cm) of garter stitch. In the middle, use stockinette stitch or the pattern being used by the gauge, until you're about 1 inch (2.5 cm) short of making a square. Finish that last inch (2.5 cm) in garter stitch. The garter stitch border will mimic how putting the stitches within the full project will affect the tension, while giving you easy points to start and end your measuring and counting.

, Set a hard ruler across your swatch to count your stitches per 4 inches (10 cm).


To get the most accurate gauge measurement, wash and dry your sample before you measure your knit gauge.
The horizontal measurement is your stitches per inch. The vertical measurement is your rows per inch.

,, If it's more than 1 stitch difference, then you probably need a thicker yarn.

, If it's more than 1 stitch fewer, then you probably need a thinner yarn.

",How to Repair a Moth Hole2," They may be very thin from wear, but should not be cut or torn. You will end up with a larger hole than you started with. This is OK.;
, This basting stitch will be removed later, so it is okay if the thread doesn't match.

, This thin yarn serves to stabilize and form a base for the actual mending, so don't draw the hole tight. Keep it the same size it was.

,, Do not double it or knot it.

, You will see that you can use the base you created with the thin yarn to make your new stitches with. Start at least one full row and one full column each side of the hole with duplicate stitch, and then continue it as Kitchener stitch over the framework you made with the thin yarn, all the way to at least one full stitch or column on the other side of the hole.

Continue slipping off stitches and binding off if you are making a larger buttonhole. For small buttonholes, you may only need to bind off a couple of stitches. But for larger button holes, you will need to bind off more stitches. Keep going until the button hole is the length that you need it to be., When you finish binding off the stitches, you will need to turn your work around. Turn the work so that the opposite side is facing you. Then, begin to cast on stitches in the direction of the buttonhole.








Cast on as many stitches as you bound off. For example, if you bound off four stitches, then cast on four stitches.

, After you finish casting on, knit one stitch to connect the cast on stitches to the opposite side of the buttonhole.

Knit two and pull the first stitch over the second.,
Resume knitting as before.,
Bind off enough stitches to make the length of the buttonhole.,
Continue knitting.",How to Knit Buttonholes2," For the first row, you will be binding off the stitches to create one side of the buttonhole. Begin by knitting two and then pull the first stitch you knit over the second one to bind off the first stitch.Continue binding off by knitting one and pulling the first stitch over the second stitch.
Continue to bind off as many stitches as you need to create your buttonhole.

, When you finish binding off your required stitches for the buttonhole, resume knitting. Finish knitting to the end of the row or until you need to make another buttonhole.







, When you come back around to the space where you started the buttonhole, you will need to cast on additional stitches to cover the length of the buttonhole.For example, if you bound off three stitches, then you will need to cast on three stitches.

, After you cast on enough stitches to cover the area of the buttonhole, resume knitting as usual. On your next round, knit across the stitches you cast on in the same manner as the other stitches."
"
Check the size of your buttons first.,
Identify where the buttonhole will be placed.,
Maintain good tension to ensure tight buttonholes.,
Reinforce or adjust the buttonholes if needed.",How to Knit Buttonholes3," Don’t make the buttonholes too large or too small for your buttons. Measure the buttons and try to make the buttonholes slightly smaller than the buttons.Try holding up the buttons against the buttonholes as you create them. This will help to ensure that you do not make them too large or too small.

, It is important to know where you want each buttonhole to be. Measure the area and place stitch markers so you will know where to place each buttonhole as you go.


You can also mark the placement spots with a small safety pin or paper clip.

, As you bind off, cast on, and knit over the areas with buttonholes, it is important to keep good tension. This will help to ensure that your buttonholes will be secure. Hold the yarn taut as you create the buttonholes to ensure that your buttonholes will be tight., If you do end up with buttonholes that are loose or too small, then you can use a knitting needle and some extra yarn to reinforce the buttonhole. Using a ""yarn needle"" and the same yarn that you are using to knit your item, stitch around the edges of the buttonhole, using the same ""buttonhole stitch"" that is used when sewing on fabric. This will reinforce the buttonhole. Or if your buttonhole is too long, stitch across one or both of the ends to make the buttonhole shorter."

Pause before starting what will be your project's final row.,
Start by doing only the first two stitches of the final row.,
Pull the second stitch on the right-hand needle over the first and off the needle.,
Add another stitch on the last row.,
Repeat the process as described above.,
Cut the yarn to free your project.,
Pull the tail through the loop of the final stitch.",How to Finish Knitting1," This type of cast-off requires two knitting needles. It will create a tight edge without much stretchiness. Replace your right-hand needle with a larger one if you want it to have a little more give., It often works best to continue following the project's pattern on this row, though you can also knit or purl across. This will leave you with two stitches on your right-hand needle and the rest of the project still on your left-hand needle.







, Use your fingers to gently lift it up and over. The second stitch will now form a loop around the yarn leading to the first. Keep the remaining first stitch on the right-hand needle.







, The new stitch should now be the one closest to the point of your right needle, while what was previously the first stitch is now the second. Continue to follow the project's pattern if you're using one. These stitches will functionally be your final row.








, Keep adding another stitch to the right needle and pulling the older stitch over it and off the needle. Work until the last stitch of your project is alone on your right needle. Be extra careful when doing these stitches, as they will make up the edge of your project. The quality of the stitching will be much more apparent than with the inner rows.







, Make sure to leave a tail of free yarn between one to five inches long. Leave a longer tail if you plan to sew or weave this piece to another. For weaving, leave at least 12 inches.








, Remove your piece from the right-hand needle. Tug the tail until the final loop is closed and secure. Trim off any extra tail yarn unless you will be adding to it later as previously discussed.

Understand what garter stitch is.,
Gather your materials.,
Determine which hold you prefer.,
Cast on your stitches.,
Hold the needles in the starting position.,
Push the tip of the right needle into the first loop on the left needle.,
Wrap the yarn around the right needle.,
Pull the right needle through the loop.,
Pull the loop off the left needle.,
Continue knitting.,
Switch the needles in your hands.",How to Knit the Garter Stitch," The garter stitch is one of the easiest stitches to do, and is commonly the first stitch learned by novice knitters. This technique allows you to knit every row, and the material tends to lie flat during the knitting process.Garter stitch is characterized by ridges on both sides of the material in between rows of bumpy fabric., Decide on the yarn and needles you would like to use. When you're first starting to knit, larger needles and thicker yarn will make learning easier. Try size 8, 14"" long knitting needles.If you have smaller needles and yarn, try to make loose stitches that allow plenty of room to maneuver.

, Knitters can work Continental-style or English-style. Try out both as you learn to knit, and evaluate what works best for you. These instructions are for English-style knitting, but they can be easily adapted for Continental style.

, Before you begin knitting, cast-on as many stitches as your pattern requires. After the cast-on stitches are ready, make sure the first stitch is one inch from the top of the needle.







, Begin garter stitch by holding the needle with the cast-on in your left hand and the other needle in your right hand. Hold the yarn in your right hand.


Make sure the left needle tip is pointing towards the right., Push the needle into the loop from the bottom to the top.When you do this, the right needle should cross behind the left needle.









The needle tips will be making a T or X pattern.
Make sure the yarn lies to the back of your needles.

, Hold the yarn securely in your hand and wrap it around the back of the right needle near the tip, counter-clockwise. Then, pull the yarn clockwise across the front of the right needle so that it sits between the two needles.








The yarn can be held and wrapped using either your right or your left hand. Choose whichever feels more comfortable to you. Some people hold both needles with only the right or the left hand, and then use their free hand to wrap the yarn around the needles. Others prefer to keep holding the needles in both hands and then wrap the yarn around the needle with their right hand while the right hand still holds the right needle.
Try holding the yarn between your thumb and forefinger.

, Start to gently pull the tip of the right needle back through the first loop towards you, bringing the yarn you looped around the needle with it. You might want to angle the right needle slightly towards yourself to bring the yarn through the loop.Slowly pull the right needle all the way through then bring the right needle up, so that it's on top of the left needle.









Don't pull too hard or you will pull the needle right out.
Make sure to keep the yarn in your hand taut so that the yarn you wrapped around the right needle doesn't loosen as you pull it through the loop.
Make sure that the yarn you wrapped around the right needle stays on the needle as you pull it through the loop.
When you have completed this step, the right needle is in front of the left needle.

, Carefully lift the right needle to the right so that the old loop on the left needle slides off.








Keep the yarn taut after each stitch so that the loops are close to the needle but not so hard that you can't slide the needle into them.
The first knit stitch should now be on the right needle.

, Knit all the cast-on stitches in the same way until there are no more cast-on stitches on your left needle.









When all the stitches are on your right needle, you have finished your first row of knitting.

, Your left hand should be the one holding all the stitches. You are now ready to start knitting your second row in exactly the same way as the first.









When you turn your material, the yarn hanging out of the first stitch should be in the front.What you have just finished, including the cast-on, is considered row 1."
"
Determine if this bind-off is right for the project.,
Line up the stitches.,
Insert a third needle.,
Knit the first stitch of the seam.,
Pull the second stitch of the third needle up and around the first.,
Repeat the above process.,
Cut the yarn when you've finished your final stitch.",How to Finish Knitting2," This cast-off works best for creating shoulder seams of sweaters and in other projects requiring a change of direction. It can also be used to join two separate pieces of knitting.


If you're binding a single piece, work your project from the middle, moving out toward either side. When you reach the final row, leave your stitches on the needle. Before you begin this cast-off, you should have an equal number of ""live"" stitches on two needles.
When joining separate pieces, leave the final row of each on a knitting needle. They must be made up of the same number of loops., Use your left hand to place the needles parallel to each other. The finished portion of each piece should be pointing downwards. Make sure each stitch lines up with its partner.

, Place this third needle underneath the first two needles and through the first stitch on each. The first stitches should now be wrapped around the third needle.









A third needle that is wider than the first two is preferable but not necessary.

, Use your working yarn to make the first new stitch over your third needle. Pull this new stitch under the other two existing loops. Tug the two original stitches off of their needles. Repeat this so that your third needle has two loops.








, Use your fingers to gently lift it up and over. The second stitch will now form a secure loop around the first. Keep the remaining first stitch on the third needle.







, Add new stitches to your third needle and pull the old stitch over the new one. Keep working until you've stitched together every loop. This is very similar to the standard bind-off with the major difference being you are knitting through two loops at a time instead of one. Another major difference is that the final edge you are creating will be inside the piece and invisible.








, Make sure to leave a tail of free yarn between one to five inches long. Pull the tail through the loop of the final stitch. Remove your piece from the third needle. Tug the tail until the final loop is closed and secure. Trim off any excess tail yarn.

Finish your entire project, including the last row.,
Pick up two stitches with the crochet hook.,
Pull the second stitch over the first.,
Transfer the next stitch from the needle to the crochet hook.",How to Finish Knitting3," Replace your right-hand needle with a similarly-sized crochet hook. This method is very similar to the standard cast-off, but many people find working with a crochet hook faster and easier. Additionally, this method requires no additional yarn other than a short tail, in case you misjudged length or are otherwise in a bind. , Slide the hook underneath the first two loops on the needle. Remove them from the needle onto your crochet hook. Slide the hoops down so that they rest on the straight part of the tool rather than the hook itself.







, With either your fingers or knitting tools, carefully take the second loop and bring it up over the first. Remove the second stitch from the crochet hook while leaving the first.







, You should now have two loops on the hook. Repeat the previous step with these two stitches. Continue this process with each loop that remains on your needle. Pull the small tail of yarn through the last stitch to finish.

Finish your project.",How to Change Colors in Knitting," Whether you're working from a pattern or just knitting freely, use your main color to knit as many stitches and rows as needed in your desired style of stitch. When you get to the point where you'll be changing colors, finish the last stitch on the row you're working on.









New colors usually get added at the beginning of a new row.When you add a new color, don’t cut the yarn from the original color.Instead, just leave it hanging where you left off.
When possible, join yarn of the same color in a spot where it won’t be as noticeable, such as at a seam or in a spot that’s tucked away, like under an arm on a sweater.;
, Start the next row as you normally would, by sticking the tip of the right needle in the first stitch on the left side. Grab your contrasting color and give yourself a tail that’s at least six inches long (longer is fine).








In knitting, the dominant color is called the main color, and additional colors are called contrasting colors.

, Take the working yarn and tail of the new color and wrap them both around the tip of the needle that’s inserted into the first stitch. Gently tighten the previous stitch to keep it from coming loose.









Knit like this, using the tail and the working yarn, for about three stitches to help secure the new yarn in place.

, After the first three stitches, drop the tail and knit normally with the new color.









If you are going to be knitting stripes or changing back and forth between the two colors, you can carry the yarn so that you don’t have multiple tails to deal with later.

, When you have finished knitting your piece, cut the excess yarn off, leaving tails of about six inches that you can secure by weaving them into the knitting. Grab a tapestry needle and thread the needle with the yarn tail. Turn your work over so you're working on the wrong side, and then:








Pick a yarn that you can follow with the tail. The idea is to weave the tail through your knitting, following the same piece of yarn, to hide it behind that yarn. Use the tapestry needle to weave through the stitches on the backside, following the same piece of yarn the whole way.
Don’t pull the tail too tight: you want it to be the same tension as the rest of the knitting.
Knit about six inches of tail to secure it properly. When you're finished, gently stretch the knitting out and then trim the end of the tail.

, If you are knitting stripes or other patterns that require you to switch colors every few rows, you can carry the other yarn with you up the side of your work so that you don’t end up with a bunch of loose tails at the end. If your knitting in red with blue stripes, for instance, start your knitting with the red yarn.









The carrying yarn method really only works when you're knitting back and forth, not in the round.

, When it comes time to change colors, switch to blue following the instructions above and knit your first row. When you get to the second row with your new color, it’s time to carry the red yarn up.








, Wrap the red yarn over top of the blue yarn one time. Then, pick up the blue yarn from underneath the red and make your first stitch. This yarn twist will lock the red yarn into the first stitch on the new row, leaving it easily accessible.








Continue knitting that row with the blue yarn.
As you work, give your knitting a gentle tug to prevent the yarns from becoming to tight. If they are, they could bunch up and distort the knitting.Also make sure the yarn you're carrying isn’t too loose, as this will create large loops.
As long as you're going to continue switching between the two colors, continue carrying the yarn for each new row, even when you change colors again.

, There are many intricate color patterns in knitting that require you to change the yarn color multiple times in a single row, such as fair isle patterns. To do this, you can use a technique called stranded knitting, where you float the yarn you aren't using horizontally behind the work so that you can alternate between colors when necessary.








To start, knit as many stitches or rows as needed in your first color. When the pattern indicates to change colors, do so by joining the new yarn color as practiced above.

, For stranded knitting, you will hold and carry both yarn colors at the same time. Hold your background (main) color normally in your right hand. Hold your contrast color in your left hand, continental style.









Alternatively, you can hold your contrast color in your right hand, but be sure to wrap it around your ring and pinky finger.Continue knitting according to the pattern, alternating between the colors as needed.
Be sure the keep the float loose, otherwise it will cause puckering. However, you don’t want it so loose that it’s drooping down and catching on things.

, If your pattern requires you to go more than five stitches with one color, you will need to catch, or wrap, the floating yarn to ensure it doesn’t get too long.








To catch a float from your contrast color, insert the needle as usual, but make sure it goes under the yarn on the left hand. Finish knitting the stitch with the background color in your right hand.To catch a float from your background color, insert the needle into the stitch and wrap the background color around the needle, but don’t knit the stitch. Instead, wrap the contrast color around the tip, then unwrap the background color and knit the stitch with the contrast color.
Always follow a caught stitch with a regular one.

, Once you’ve got both yarn colors going, make sure you twist the yarns around each other once at the beginning of every new row if you're knitting back and forth. This will ensure both yarns are available when you need them.







, Gently stretch out the knitting to even out the stitches.When you have finished, weave the tails into your knitting to secure them in place.

, Be careful however as the colour may have faded and the colour under the stitches may look darker. If not, you can remove the stitches and put a new picture on. This is great for children's garments.

, Now put away your knitting needles and bring out a darning needle. Use the same size yarn of a different colour. If you have knit your article with 4-ply worsted yarn, use the same type of yarn so that your stitches are covered evenly.

, Remember, too much yarn means tangles, too little yarn means you tie more knots.








, You will now see the right side of the stitch covered. Bring the needle down and through the same place as your beginning stitch. You now have one stitch covered.









Don't pull too tightly or you will have a crumple. Don't leave too loose or your stitches will hang. Keep your tension the same as the knitted article. This will take practice.

Decide which decrease to use.,
K2tog or knit two together: This is one of the simplest decreases.,
P2tog or purl two together: This is the same as k2tog, except you will pick up two stitches as if you are purling one and purl them to create a left slanting decrease.

Pay attention to whether your are decreasing on a purl stitch or a knit stitch.",How to Knit Decreases," If you're knitting without a pattern or if the pattern is very vague, you might be left up to your own devices to choose a decrease. Consider whether you want a hole in the knitting or a seamless change. The following steps will help you to learn about some of the the different decreases.;
, To do this, decrease slide your needle under the second down stitch as if you were going to knit into it and pick up the first stitch as well. Then knit both of them. You're basically treating two stitches like they are one. This is a very tight, right-slanting decrease.








,, Use the right needle to slip the second stitch on the left needle over this stitch and off. Slip the first left needle stitch back onto the right needle to finish a right slanting decrease.








, Slip the first two stitches (knitwise) off your left needle and onto your right. Insert the left needle back into both stitches and knit them from the back. This is another tight, right slanting decrease.









There is also SSK improved, where you slip the first stitch knitwise and the second stitch purlwise so the decrease lays flatter.

, Come up with the back through the two stitches and purl them together for a right slanting decrease.








,, Slip two stitches knitwise, and then knit them together like a normal YO as you slip them back onto the left needle.








, This gives you a clue as to which decrease to use because you should use a decrease that creates the correct stitch to blend into the pattern or overall stitch on your knitting piece.

, After you have finished the cast on and the initial four rows, you are ready to start your cable row. Start by purling the first six stitches. Be sure to give a slight tug after each one. This will help take some of the strain off of the cable stitches, and prevent any holes, tension issues, etc., Try to get a cable needle in the same size as your knitting needle, otherwise, your gauge might not turn out right.


If you don't have a cable needle, you can use a double-pointed knitting needle, or even a pencil or pen. Keep in mind that this may cause some gauging issues.

, Where you place the cable needle will determine which way the cable will twist:If you want your cable to twist to the left, leave the cable needle in front of your work. This is known as the front cable.
If you want your cable twist to the right, place cable needle behind your knitting kneels; this is known as the back cable.

, Leave those first three stitches on the cable needle. You will knit them in the next step; this will create the ""twist.""

, Avoid pulling too tightly. Instead, try to keep your cable needle as close to your project as possible. This will make it easier to knit later on., Put the cable needle off to the side, and purl the final stitches off of your knitting needle. Once you have finished, flip your work, so that the needle with all the stitches is in your left hand, and the empty needle is in your right hand.

, You will not be using the cable during these three rows. This will create the curved part of the cable, and is known as the ""working rows""


Row 1: knit six stitches, purl six stitches, and knit six stitches.
Row 2: purl six stitches, knit six stitches, and then purl six stitches.
Row 3: knit six stitches, purl six stitches, and knit six stitches.

, Purl six stitches and insert the cable into the next three stitches. Knit three stitches off of the knitting needle, then knit the stitches off of the cable. Finish off with six more purl stitches.

, After each set of three working rows, do a cable row. Remember to place the cable needle on the same side each time (front or back).

Hang the yarn over your thumb and index finger, with the tail end dangling off your thumb and the end attached to the yarn ball hanging over your index finger. Make sure you have at least a foot of extra yarn hanging from your thumb.Use your remaining fingers to grasp the two strands of yarn and hold them together.
The yarn should make a triangular shape with points at your thumb, your index finger, and the remaining fingers holding the strands of yarn together.;
, Take a needle. Using your right hand, put the needle under the string held between your thumb and index finger. Secure the yarn to the needle by pressing down on it with your right index finger. Pull the yarn downward, away from your left thumb and index finger. This should make a slight indent in your triangle.








Pass the needle over the strand of thread between your thumb and index finger, slightly looping this strand onto the needle. It's very important you move your needle over this strand of yarn and not under it. From here, move the tip of the needle towards your thumb.
Keep pulling the needle and thread downward towards the base of your thumb. A loop of yarn should form around your thumb. Another loop should form around your index finger.
Push the tip of the needle through the thumb loop. The tip of the needle should pass underneath the yarn, and not over the yarn. Now, move the needle towards the loop of yarn on your index finger. Pass the tip of the needle over the loop on your index finger. It's important the needle goes over this loop, and not under it. Remember, your needle goes under the loop on your thumb, and then over the loop on your index finger.
Once you've passed the needle over the loop on your index finger, move the needle back towards your thumb. Continue moving the needle forward until it passes underneath the thumb loop.
Release the thumb loop. Pull down on the yarn released from the thumb loop to tighten the stitch you've created. You should now have one stitch securely wrapped around your needle.

, You'll add stitches by creating a triangle similar to the one you began with. The tail end of the yarn will hang over your thumb. The end attached to the ball of yarn will hang over your index finger. However, you do not need to grasp the ends together this time. They are attached by the needle. The needle takes the place held by your remaining fingers when you were casting on.








Move the needle downward. A loop of yarn should form around your thumb and index finger.
Pass the needle underneath the thumb loop. Then, move the needle towards the index finger loop. Pass it over this loop and, once again, move the needle back towards the thumb until it passes under the thumb loop.
Release the thumb loop and pull the yarn released to tighten. You have added one stitch. Repeat this process until you've added as many stitches as you want. It's a good idea to use an even number of stitches when knitting ribbing.

, The working yarn refers to the yarn still attached to the ball. The tail yarn is the end of the yarn, unattached to the ball. When knitting or purling, only use the the working yarn as you add to the project. The tail yarn will be tied into a knot when you finish knitting and the tail end of it will be snipped off.

, To start, hold your needles. One needle should contain all the stitches. The other needle should be bare. Hold the bare needle in your right hand. Hold the stitched needle in your left hand., You'll start by working with the stitch nearest the tip of stitched needle. The stitches form tiny circular loops around the needle. You will want to pass the bare needle through the bottom of this loop.To knit, you will want to enter the stitch from the front. This means, you should enter the stitch on the side of the needle facing you. You also want to put the tip of bare the needle between the front stitch and the stitch just behind the front stitch. Do not place the bare needle's tip between the front stitch and the tip of the stitched needle.
Once you have the positioning correct, push the tip of the needle through this stitch. Move about a half an inch's worth of the bare needle through the stitch and then stop.

, Now, grab your working yarn with your right hand. You're going to wrap the working yarn around the tip of the bare needle. Wrap the yarn around the bare needle and over the stitched needle. Make sure to wrap the working yarn clockwise. Do not wrap the yarn counter clockwise. The loop should form around the back of the bare needle.







, The two needles should now be somewhat secured together with the working yarn, forming a roughly ninety degree angle. One loop of yarn should be formed around the bare needle. Use your right hand to pull down on the working yarn, preventing this loop from coming undone.









Use your left hand to slowly move the stitched needle upward.
Pass it over the tip of the bare needle.
As you do this, simultaneously pass the tip of the bare needle through the first stitch on the stitched needle.
Make sure you point the bare needle inward. The bare needle's tip should be pointing towards the other stitches as it passes through the first stitch.

, Now, you'll be transferring the stitch from the stitched needle to the bare needle. Hold the other stitches in place with your left index finger. Gently slide the bare needle forward, taking the first stitch with you. Keep sliding until the needles separate again, with one stitch now on the bare needle.








If you're new to knitting, you'll have to move slowly throughout this process. As you become more adept at knitting, you'll find you can move through it swiftly.

, To purl, pick up your needles again. You should hold the stitched needle in your left hand and the bare needle in your right hand.

, Purling is essentially the opposite of knitting. To start, you'll be pushing the bare needle through the back of the first stitch rather than through the front.Take the tip of the bare needle and place it behind the stitched needle. The bare needle should enter the first stitch on the side of the stitches not facing you.
You will also enter the stitch differently. Place the bare needle's tip between the front stitch and the tip of the stitched needle. Do not put the tip of bare the needle between the front stitch and the stitch just behind the front stitch.
Once the positioning is correct, push the tip of the bare needle through the loop formed by the first stitch. Push about half an inch of the bare needle through the stitch.

, Take the working yarn with your right hand. Move the yarn around the bare needle and over the stitched needle. The yarn should be pulled counter clockwise this time, looping the yarn around the front of the bare needle rather than the back.







, The process from here is similar to knitting. Secure the loop on the bare needle by using your right hand to hold the working thread down. Slowly move the stitched needle over the tip of the bare needle.








Once again, make sure to pass the bare needle through the loop formed by the first stitch as you pass the needles over one another.

, Holding the remaining stitches down with your left hand, gently slide the bare needle forward. Keep sliding until the first stitch transfers to the bare needle. The needles should be separated now, with one stitch on the bare needle.







, Ribbing creates a pattern by alternating between knitting and purling. To start ribbing, knit one stitch. If you're new to knitting, go slowly. You want to make sure you knit the stitch correctly as not to mess up your pattern.







, As purling requires a different starting point than knitting, you'll have to adjust your yarn after you knit the first stitch. To do so, take the working yarn with your right hand. The working yarn should be on the right side of the bare needle. Take the working yarn and pass it behind the bare needle to transfer it to the left side.








Make sure to transfer the thread every time. Otherwise, you will be unable to purl correctly.

, From here, purl one stitch. Work slowly if you're new to purling to avoid screwing up the pattern. You'll have to move the thread again when you finish purling. You can move the thread from the left to the right side, passing it behind the bare needle., To knit ribbing, you'll knit one, purl one, until you reach the end of your row. Then, switch which hands are holding the needles and begin the knit one, purl one pattern again. Continue in this pattern until you've knit as much as ribbing as you need for a given project.








Do not forget to transfer the thread before each new stitch.
For some projects, you may be required to knit two, purl two.
Go slowly at first. It takes awhile to find your rhythm in knitting. Eventually, you'll feel comfortable with the flow of it.

A bulky weight yarn is ideal for this stitch, but you can also use a thinner yarn if you prefer. If you are trying the brioche stitch for the first time, then you will need:two balls of bulky weight yarn in two different colors or two balls of the same color
a pair of US 13 straight needles or US 13 circular needles for knitting in the round
a stitch marker (only if knitting in the round);
, Choose one of your colors to begin with and cast on as many stitches as you like. If you just want to practice this stitch, then 20 stitches is good amount for straight needles, or 36 stitches for knitting on the round.








Make sure that you cast on an even number of stitches.You can turn your practice project on straight needles into a scarf or turn your practice project on the round into a hat.

, To purl to stitches together, put your right needle through the next two stitches on the left needle. The right needle should cross in front of the left needle as you do this. Then, wrap the front piece of yarn around the right needle and pull it through the two stitches on the left needle.As you do so, slip the stitches off of the left needle. The stitch on your right needle will replace them.“P2 together” is the abbreviation for purling two stitches together.

, Take the strand of yarn that is in front of the needles and pull it up so that it is in front of the most recent stitch on the right needle. Then, insert the right needle into the first stitch on the left needle as if you are going to purl this stitch. Instead, slip the stitch off of the left needle and onto the right needle.The yarn over is often abbreviated as “YO” in knitting patterns., After you have completed the sequence of P2 together and YO, then you will need to repeat it until you get to the end of the row or round.








If you are knitting on two straight needles, then you can just turn the stitches around when you get to the end of the row and then continue working the pattern the same fashion.
If you are working the brioche stitch in the round, then you will need to change the pattern for the second row.

, If you are knitting in the round, then you will need to grasp the piece of yarn that is behind the stitches before you can begin the second row. You can just let the other piece of yarn hang down in front of your stitches. You will not need to use it until you get to the next round., Just as you did a yarn over for the purl round, you will need to do yarn over for the knit round. However, this time you will need to keep the strand of yarn behind the left needle and insert your right needle behind it. Then, slip the stitch off of the left needle and onto the right needle.







, Next, instead of purling two stitches together, you will be knitting two stitches together. Insert your right needle through the next two stitches on the left needle, and then wrap your yarn over the right needle. Holding the yarn taut, pull the yarn through the two stitches and allow them to slide off of the left needle as the new stitch replaces them on the right needle.Knit two together is abbreviated as “K2 together” in knitting patterns., You will need to continue to YO and K2 together until the end of this round. Then, you will switch back to the purl row pattern.

You can find the recommended needle sizes for different types of yarn by checking the yarn label.;
, Casting on is how you begin every knitting project. Start by looping the yarn around your finger twice and then pull the back loop through the front loop to make a slipknot.Then, slip the slipknot onto the needle in your non-dominant hand. Loop the yarn around the needle and pull new yarn through it make more cast on stitches.









If you are following a pattern, then cast on the number of stitches that the pattern specifies. If you just want to practice the knit stitch, then cast on 10 stitches.

, You should hold the needle with the cast on stitches on it in your non-dominant hand and the other needle in your dominant hand. Hold the needles near the points for better control of the knitting motion.

, Place the needles so that the right needle crosses behind the left needle. Then, insert the tip of your right needle into the back of the first stitch on the left needle.









When working the knit stitch, it is important to always go in through the back of the stitch.

, Your working yarn should always be behind the needles while you knit, so position it this way if it is not already behind the stitches.

, Wrap your working yarn around the tip of the back needle, so that the yarn hangs between the two needles.This yarn will form your first new knit stitch.









If you are right handed, then you will loop the yarn around counterclockwise. If you are left handed, then you will loop the yarn around clockwise.

, Use your non-dominant hand to hold the free end of the yarn and ensure that the loop is secure. Then, pull the tip of the right needle gently back through the first loop towards you, bringing the yarn with it.







, Let the old loop slide off the end of the needle.Keep the yarn taut after each stitch to keep the loops close to the needle but not so tight that you can't slide the needle into the loops.









Be careful as you slid off the cast on stitch. Make sure that only the stitch that you knit into comes off.

, You should have one new knit stitch on your right (dominant hand) needle. Repeat the process to knit the other cast on stitches.








, When all of the stitches are on your right needle, you have finished your first row of knitting. You can continue knitting your other rows in the same way until you finish your project or until you feel like you have mastered the knit stitch.








, To knit the second row as well, you do not have to reverse the movement. Simply switch the needle with all of the stitches on it over to your non-dominant hand again. You are now ready to start knitting your second row in exactly the same way as you did the first row.








, This produces what is otherwise known as the garter stitch.If your pattern calls for the garter stitch, then you will simply need to knit all of the rows.








, Once you're skilled at knitting the knit stitch, you will find it becomes second nature and you'll be using it to make garments, accessories and much more. Practice the knit stitch until you feel comfortable using it.

Then continue alternating stitch types as before.As you continue, just remember to:








Purl your knit stitches. Knit stitches look flatter and have a criss-cross pattern.
Knit your purl stitches. Purl stitches stick out more and they do not have a criss-cross pattern., Keep checking the stitch type when you start a new row and alternating as you continue the rows until you are finished with your project.

, As the name implies, you will be using both the tail and working yarn to create your stitches. Because of its versatility, it is probably the most popular cast-on among knitters.This is a good cast on for stockinette and stitches and ribbed patterns.

, This method requires you to crochet a chain first, then knit into the chain. Once you have finished your piece, you can undo the crochet chain, slip the needle back through the loops, and continue knitting downward.Here are some reasons for using the provisional cast on:








You don't know how to finish the edge of your piece, and want to decide later.
You don't know how long to make the piece yet, and want to add length to it later.
You are making several pieces and want to attach them seamlessly.
You are working with lace and want to create a mirror image.

, The tip of the needle should be pointing towards your thumb.








, Make an upward motion with the needle as you do this.








, Make the loop snug, but do not make it too tight.








, Both the cast on loop and the slipknot should be the same size and tension. You may need to tighten or loosen the knots to do this.








, Each cast on equals one stitch. The slipknot also counts as one stitch.

, Hold the needle in your dominant hand. With both strands in the palm of your non-dominant hand, take your thumb and index finger in between the two strands and spread them apart. Make a loop in the length of yarn that is stretched between your thumb and finger and slide your knitting needle through the loop. tugging gently to tighten.








, The tail yarn is over the back of your thumb; the working yarn is over your index finger. When you pull the needle down, the working yarn crosses over the tail, which forms a loop of yarn around your thumb.








, The needle should be right next to your thumb. There should be a strand of yarn to either side of the needle. Once you've caught the loop on your thumb, reach the needle over to the index finger.

Make a chain stitch using a crochet needle two times the size of your knitting needle.,
Pull the chain off the crochet needle.,
Hold the chain in your left hand and the needle in your right hand.,
Stick the tip of the needle into the third bump of the crochet chain.,
Drape the ball end of the yarn over the tip of the needle.,
Use the needle to pull the yarn through the bump.Try pointing the tip of the needle upward as you pull it through the bump.,
Repeat the steps until you have cast on the number of stitches that the pattern requires.",How to Cast On4," It is best to use a smooth, light colored yarn. Keep making chains until you have the same number of stitches your pattern requires, then add at least six more chains.Here is how to make a crochet chain stitch:








Make a small circle with the yarn. The tail end should be on top of the ball end. Both ends should be facing in opposite directions.
Poke the a crochet needle through the circle and catch it onto the tail end.
Pull it through the circle partway so that you have a loop.
Take the hook out and poke it through the loop you just made. Gently tug on the tail end and ball end of the yarn, tightening the loop. The yarn should now be on your crochet needle.
Fold the ball end of the yarn over the hook and away from you.
Use the hook to pull the yarn through the slipknot. This will cause the slipknot to fall off the hook. This is one chain stitch. To make another, fold the yarn over the hook, towards yourself. Use the hook to pull it through the loop so that it is on the crochet needle.

, Be gentle with it so that it does not unravel. Once it's the length you need, cut it free of the working yarn. Take the end and pull it back through the last chain you worked to secure the chain and to keep it from unraveling. Take what's left of the tail and make a temporary slip knot — this is the end you will unravel to release your stitches.








, You will notice that one side of the chain looks like a row of V's. The other side looks like a chain with bumps. You will be sticking the needle into these bumps.

, You don't want the needle to be sticking all the way through the bump — stick it just far enough so that you can catch yarn with it.








, Be sure to leave a tail that is several inches long. Hold the yarn tight over the needle.








, The loop that ends up on your needle is your first stitch.








, Keep slipping the needle through the bumps in the chain, and pulling loops of yarn through.

Alternate back and forth as needed.",How to Crochet Cable Stitch1," Attach the yarn to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work a foundation of 12 chain stitches.


If you do not know how to work a chain stitch or make a slipknot, please consult the ""Tips"" section.;
, Chain an additional three stitches, then double crochet once into each stitch of your foundation chain. Turn the work when you reach the end of the row.


Check the ""Tips"" section if you do not know how to double crochet.
The foundation chain and first row are not part of the cable stitch itself. Instead, they merely provide a base for you to work your first cable stitches from.

, Create a turning chain of three stitches, then double crochet once into each of the first two stitches of the previous row.


A turning chain is a set of chain stitches that brings your row height to the point it needs to be at for your next row.
This step begins your first cable row.

, Work one triple crochet into the next stitch, catching the front posts of the previous row's stitch only. Work one more triple crochet into the stitch after that, catching the front posts only again.


Check the ""Tips"" section for instructions on making a triple crochet.
When you work a front post stitch, the hook will enter the stitch through the front, go around that front post, and then come back out to the front again., Work one double crochet into each of the next two stitches.


These two double crochets balance out the two that come before the cable stitch. The number of stitches you make here should always equal the number of stitches you made prior to working the two front post triple crochets.
This step completes one basic cable stitch. The basic cable stitch, in general, is made simply by forming stitches around the posts of the stitches in the row directly below them.

, For this example, you will need to double crochet once into each of the next two stitches, front post triple crochet once into the two stitches after that, and double crochet once into the final two stitches of the row.


If you had a longer foundation, you would have needed additional sets of cable stitches after that.
Completing this step completes a full cable row.

, Turn the work, then create a turning chain of three chain stitches. Double crochet once into each of the next two stitches.


This step starts the ""wrong side"" row. The purpose of this row is to balance out the cable row, so the stitches will essentially be the reverse of those on your cable row.

, Work one triple crochet into the back posts of the first front post triple crochet you run into. Work another triple crochet into the back posts of the second front post triple crochet from your previous row.


To work a back post stitch, insert the hook beside the post from the back, go around the post, and bring the hook out through the back again.

, After working your back post triple crochets, work one double crochet into each of the next two stitches.

, For this row, you will need to work two double crochets, two back post triple crochets, and two final double crochets to reach the end of the row.


No matter how many stitches your previous row has, you should mirror the stitches made in that previous row. Double crochet once into each normal double crochet. Back post triple crochet into each front post triple crochet.

, At this point, you already have a full set of basic cable stitches. If you want a longer cable pattern, alternate back and forth between cable rows and wrong side rows until you reach the length you desire.


Once you reach your desired pattern length, the project is finished.

Learn the four main terms of knitting.,
Cast on by making a slipknot and place it on a knitting needle.,
Learn to knit by holding the needle with your cast-on stitches in the right hand,the stationary needle, and the other in your left hand, the working needle.,
Understand that Purl stitch is what is seen on the back of the knit stitch.,
Cast off when you are finished with a section of knitting.,
Following a pattern closely is extremely important.,
Knitting left-handed is no harder to learn than knitting right-handed.",How to Knit Left Handed," Cast on, knit, purl and cast off. They are all difficult to describe without pictures (check the article links added here), but all knitting books seem to show pictures only for righties. On the one hand, it's possible to just reverse the pattern, which can even be done holding images up to a small mirror. On the other hand, author of Stitch 'n Bitch, Debbie Stoller, advises that lefties can sometimes benefit from learning Continental stitch, which requires you to hold the yarn in your left hand., Hold this needle in your right hand. With the left hand, make a loop the shape of a pink breast cancer ribbon, with the loose end of the yarn lying on top. Hold this loop between the thumb and index finger of the left hand, twist it slightly left and place it on the needle. Tighten it so it holds to the needle without being snug. You now have two stitches cast on. Continue making loops and sliding them onto the needle until you have the number of stitches you want. Note: There are dozens of ways to cast on. Once you master this, experiment with others.

, Insert the working needle up into the first stitch on the stationary needle. Then hold the needles in an X shape with your right hand. With your left, wrap the yarn coming from the ball around the working needle, going from outside the X to the inside. Hold this yarn along the body of the working needle as you use the needle to pull it through the loop, which is still on the right-hand needle. Slide the original loop off the right-hand needle. Repeat with the next stitch on the stationary needle. When you finish a row, turn and work the next row, either using the knit stitch again (garter stitch) or switching to purl (stockinette stitch).

, Hold the needle with your cast-on stitches in the right hand,the stationary needle, and hold the other in your left hand,the working needle. Insert the working needle into the first stitch on the stationary needle, from the left side of the stitch. Hold the needles in an X shape with the right hand, and with the left, wrap the loose end of the yarn around the working needle, going from inside the X to the outside. Hold this yarn along the body of the working needle as you use the needle to push it through the loop, which is still on the right-hand needle. Slide the original loop off the right-hand needle. Repeat with the next stitch on the stationary needle.

, This works the yarn off the needle, giving it a finished look. Knit the first two stitches, then insert the stationary needle into the left-most stitch on the working needle and slide this stitch over the other and off the needle. Knit another stitch from the stationary needle, then slide the left-most stitch over and off. Repeat until you have only one loop left on the working needle. Take this loop off the needle, cut the loose yarn, slip the end of the yarn through the loop and tighten into a knot.

, Many knitters make a gauge swatch (a small square) to ensure that the correct number of stitches with the needle size suggested by the pattern produces the correct square size. You may need to change needle sizes to 'get gauge'. For the most part, patterns can be followed as written. Sometimes increase and decrease techniques (for example, s s k vs. k2tog) will need to be reversed for the stitches to lie as intended on the finished piece. In an asymmetric patterns, following the written instructions will result in a piece that is the mirror image of that pictured. If the asymmetric pattern has a chart, this can be solved by reading the chart from left to right.

, They both just take practice.

If you do not know how to make slip knots or chain stitches, please see the ""Tips"" section at the end of this article.

, Make three additional chain stitches, then work one double crochet into each stitch of your foundation chain. Chain three at the end of this row, turn, and work one double crochet into each double crochet of your previous row.


If you do not know how to double crochet, please check the ""Tips"" section for further instructions.
This step and the one before it merely creates a foundation for you to work with when creating a cable stitch. These two steps are not actually part of the cable stitch itself.
Note that cable stitches can also be worked into foundation rows of single crochet,but it is more commonly seen with rows of double crochet, half double crochet, or treble crochet.

, Chain three, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.


This step starts the crossed cable row, or the row in which you'll make your crossed cable stitches.
Crossed cables, in general, are made by skipping stitches, working a set of front post stitches, and returning to the skipped stitches to make additional front post stitches. In this example, you'll skip three stitches, and work cables across six stitches. The number of skipped stitches and stitches you'll work over may vary based on the specific pattern instructions you're following, however.

, Skip over the next three stitches. In the fourth stitch, double crochet once into the front posts only.


Work the front post stitch by inserting the hook through the front of the post, behind it, and back out to the front of the work.

, Work one double crochet into the front posts only of the next two stitches, giving you a total of three front post double crochets lying side-by-side.


Note that these stitches should all be slanting to the right.

, Return to the first of your three skipped stitches and double crochet once into front posts only. Double crochet once into the front posts only of the second and third skipped stitches, as well.


This step creates a cross cable with stitches that slant to the left.

, Work one double crochet into each of the remaining stitches until you reach the end of the row.


This step completes one crossed cable stitch row.

, Turn the work and chain three. Skip the first stitch of the previous row, then double crochet once into each of the next six stitches.


You're starting what is known as a ""wrong side"" row in this step. This row will balance out the cable row and help keep the overall work lying flat.

, Work one double crochet into the back posts only of the next six stitches in the row.


Work a back post stitch by inserting the hook through the back of the post, in front of it, and out again to the back of the work.

, Work one double crochet into each stitch until you reach the end of the row.


When you reach the end of the row, you've completed one wrong side row.

, You already have a full crossed cable at this point, but you should alternate between the crossed cable row and the wrong side row as often as needed until the cable pattern becomes as long as you would like it to be.


Once the pattern reaches your desired length, the process is complete.

Gather your yarn, knitting needles, and a place to put them.,
Create a pattern on graph paper or a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel that is 20 squares across and however many squares tall as you need to create a pattern.,
Choose which yarn color you will start with.,
Make four rows of stitches on the scarf for every one row in your pattern.,
Make the next four scarf rows, but refer to the next row in the pattern.,
Cast off when the scarf has reached the desired length.",How to Illusion Knit," Since this process depends on raised stitches, worsted or sweater weight yarns would work better. Select two contrasting colors of yarn.;
, For this article, we'll use a simple block or checkerboard pattern that is 20 squares wide and 6 squares high, repeated indefinitely (shown repeated twice in the example).

, It doesn't really matter which one you choose, as long as you remember which one is your ""background color"" or ""Color 1"" and which one is your ""pattern color"" or ""Color 2"". For this article, Color 1 will be white and Color 2 will be blue.

, Each row on the scarf will be 20 stitches wide.



Scarf Row 1: Cast on (i.e. knit) 20 stitches in Color 1.

Scarf Row 2: Make the next row of stitches, continuing with Color 1, but this time following the pattern (the first or bottom row in your pattern). Knit one stitch for every white square, and purl one stitch for every black square. As you go across the pattern from left to right, you'll be starting out by knitting five stitches, then purl five stitches, knit another five stitches, then purl the final five stitches. (The picture to the right shows the first five stitches having been knit.)
•To switch from knitting to purling, simply bring the yarn towards you, as shown here, then begin purling. Do the reverse to switch from purling to knitting (pull the yarn away from you).

Scarf Row 3: Knit in Color 2 for the next row. After knitting the first few stitches of Color 2, you can tie its loose end to the lead line of Color 1. However, do not cut the yarn.

Scarf Row 4: Make the next row of stitches, continuing with Color 2, but this time follow the pattern (still looking at the first row) in the opposite way as you did before. Instead of knitting the white squares and purling the black squares, do the reverse: Purl a stitch for every white square and knit a stitch for every black square. Reading the pattern from left to right, you'll purl five stitches, knit five stitches, purl five stitches and knit five stitches.

, Repeat until the scarf is finished, moving onto the next row in the pattern after completing four rows in the scarf.



Scarf Row 5: Bring Color 1 (remaining from Scarf Row 2) behind the needle as shown and knit 20 stitches across.
Scarf Row 6: Knit on the white pattern blocks, purl on the black pattern blocks, referring to Pattern Row 2.
Scarf Row 7: Switch to Color 2 and knit across.
Scarf Row 8: Purl on the white pattern blocks, knit on the black pattern blocks, referring to Pattern Row 2.
Scarf Row 9: Bring Color 1 (remaining from Scarf Row 6) behind the needle and knit 20 stitches across.
Scarf Row 10: Knit on the white pattern blocks, purl on the black pattern blocks, referring to Pattern Row 3.
Scarf Row 11: Switch to Color 2 and knit across.
Scarf Row 12: Purl on the white pattern blocks, knit on the black pattern blocks, referring to Pattern Row 3.

, Ideally, you should cast off on a Scarf Row number that is a multiple of 4 (i.e. that would normally be purled across in Color 2).

Seek to understand what insight is.,
Start to consider ways to be able to observe your subject.,
Consider this metaphor.,
Learn about some of the traps and misconceptions that can block the attainment of insight.,
Develop your levels of observation and the subsequent knowledge that arises.,
Be sincere.,
Keep observing the subject in order to improve both the depth of understanding and observation.,
Find practical uses for insight.",How to Understand and Develop Insight," Insight in essence is both knowledge and understanding derived from an ""inward sight"", or more simply, looking inside your own mind and body and observing it. It can be a natural process, or an intentional process as sometimes you need to see things differently to see them clearly, but most important is knowing which lens or style to use to make it clear.


When seeing and studying something, you might gain an understanding on how and why it happens simply by seeing it as it happens and not passing judgement. The more you watch, and the greater your depth of observation, the more information you can pick up. Knowledge is the understanding that is gained and is the part that you can use.
In its simplest example, you might learn that fire is hot, but only through touching its heat. Likewise if you don't remember that it's harmful and use that knowledge next time you reach to pick up something hot, you will burn yourself. The skill is all about developing insight so it becomes more than basic survival skills, but a way to improve skills and our quality of life and learn things on a much deeper level of understanding.;
, General mindfulness and meditation is a classic format when observing the mind and body but also for any subject you wish such as when gazing at a beautiful garden, complex poetry or art or when studying a recipe book, instruction manual or textbook. Its best to be aware that meditation (or any means used to gain an inward perspective) typically consists of two things:


1. The initiation of a laboratory-like or study field literally the moment you pay attention to it. Generally, everyone has practiced observation and had insights of various degrees throughout their life, but it generally is on a superficial level until the person decides to get to the bottom of the matter, or when they have observed so much of the subject it is more apparent.
2. When practiced to the degree of deep focus or absorption, meditation allows the mind to become far more clear, calmed and focused and can look at things without distortions or personal agendas.

, Seeing a sample under a microscope is a lot more detailed and focused than just looking at the sample in the hand. Developing the mind through meditation as well as other methodologies both sharpen your focus and gives you a clearer boundary on the thing you focus on.


However, it would be inaccurate to conclude that very deep meditation is the only way to the goal itself although it certainly does help. You might see the finer detail through a microscope certainly, but an example to consider is how expert geologists can tell the quality and type of soil in their hand just through the naked eye, or by using specific gravity tests and other chemical analyses. These skills are learned through experience and testing their understanding. They might have used a microscope in their training and career, or they might never have done so.
In this instance, it is like a bird with two wings, observation - such as meditation - is one wing, examining and understanding is the other wing. If the bird has only one wing it can't fly well, it will just go round in circles.

, They typically arise more in an intentional, guided or an intensive style of study practice rather than those rare but life changing insights that simply happen. If you are familiar with them, you can at least recognize them when they happen and if they do pop up, arguably you can learn even more if you turn your attention to these very obstacles.


There is occasionally the idea that ""the means to the end"" is actually the ""end"" itself. The complication here is the process or relationship to the process has become more important than focusing on the subject. This can be quite a common experience many go through and some do end up going to universities and colleges all their life or studying the mind in meditation in a routine style, but never really making any breakthroughs.
Try not to rush things. This is another common challenge as people hope to find a magic switch to get full understanding on their subject be it science, psychology, arts & literature and so on, or a cure for their troubles. As the metaphor goes, when the ""penny drops"" in the mind and things make sense, this often takes time to happen naturally. However, repeated observation and testing not only helps the penny drop sooner, but also the extent of the insight is broadened and many different facets can of the same experience can become clear. In this way, a person can learn to think and act more creatively and skilfully.
Some also end up stuck with nowhere to go when the insight or knowledge gained is presumed as the goal itself. Insight is just one half of the story, the other half is doing something with it. Consider that a surgeon through his or her experience designs a new scalpel or forceps, but it's only until these tools are used in surgery that they are going to be useful. In the same way, care must be taken to continuously apply and test any insights gained as well as how to use them as practical tools, which in itself can expand the depth of understanding.
The application of understanding relationships is most important, and it goes awry when people prefer to focus on the intellectual, rather than the practical. For example a chemist might discover a new medicine through testing samples, but if the treatment is never made available or ever taken by the patient, it does nothing. The medicinal discovery itself does not destroy the disease. In the same way, you have to apply your understanding to achieve the goal, for the discoveries are just a means to an end.

, Test it out, observe and study your subject.


Be objective and look at everything as if you have never seen it before. Observe it as if it's a totally unique thing, but most importantly, observe your relationship or interaction with the experience and the object. The ways we can learn the most about a subject as well as how to gain the best outcome is to observe our relationships - how do we feel about the experience - is the mind open or closed to the experience? This helps you observe life more completely, rather than being selective, or allowing parts of the mind to cloud the issue.
Ask yourself often to identify what you see, as you might not always know, even if you do identify it but a secondary feeling or idea arises, then identify that as well. Once you can identify them, you can explore them, just like once you've identified the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, you can start to put the puzzle together and you can gain practical understanding and skills.
Luckily, in essence there are very few cases when the solution to many of our life challenges aren't already within the problem we experience - or in essence, our relationship with the problem. By exploring the foundation of the problem, a solution can be found, or if a solution is simply impossible, then a person can then start to come to terms with accepting the realities of life and finding a silver lining or creative opportunity if they are practical.
In life aspects, many of our frustrations, unhappiness, depression and sorrows happen because we aren't looking at things completely and applying our understanding, or observing the issue to understand it. Generally it is wise to go back to the beginning and examine the central facts and test those in relation to what you see. You might be studying to gain an insight into a maths project, but if you are too tired or not interested then it is useful to identify this feeling as this is your relationship with the subject.

, Sincerity is actually deep in the practice and benefits of understanding. If you are seeing something that is real and can be retested to give the same result, then you will have to satisfy yourself that it is what it is. It might mean consequently you have to let go of other ideas or wishes, but ultimately that is up to you to let them go, because you cannot progress beyond these hurdles. You have to climb over them until you can leap over them.

, For example, it took a while until you could repeat the alphabet without error. Some people can learn it quickly, but these are very rare people so it pays to keep observing and learning.


Very often things can suddenly make sense (like a ""light-bulb moment""), even things you have seen dozens of times before. Through life experience, your mind develops the tools needed to put together pieces of the puzzle, as well as identify different angles and ways that the experience can be improved. The mind is often able to relate what has been seen to prior experiences in order to make connections. By using an inward observation, eventually even this tool and skill gathering becomes apparent.

, The ultimate goal is to become intimately familiar with your mind and body, how it reacts to certain things and how they inter-relate. The key benefit to knowing your mind so well is that you can take one glance at something and know instantly if it's of benefit or harm. You may then let go or avoid things that are harmful. It takes time, but it gets more effective the more you practice it––you learn more each time you examine something.


In a relationship context, insight and mindfulness - as the two wings of the bird - are useful everywhere; at work, school, home and all times in between. It has clear uses in empathy - being able to understand the challenges and issues we and other people face, and then relating and acting appropriately.
In a work or business context, insight is also incredibly useful in any area requiring creative thinking as well as conflict resolution. Many of our problematic relationships between co-workers, or between boss and employees arise because we don't understand each other and the pressures both sides experience. It's these pressures and how we interact with them that limit compromise and flexibility, so by applying our insights we can find a middle ground as well as new ideas.
In a mental well-being context, there comes a stage in most people's lives that the desires of our chattering mind becomes a common thread in the tapestry of life. As well, the understanding that it makes us unhappy and dissatisfied with what we have dawns upon us. Insight is important here in understanding how to let go of shallow desires by correctly identifying your true needs.
As a stress relief tool, eventually what insight helps us to do is to learn what stress actually is, how to let it go of it, as well as forgive it and to become so practiced in both recognizing and letting go that you just release stress without trying. Then you are free of so many of your daily troubles.
In a quality of life tool, what insight practices do eventually reveal is that every moment is absolutely unique and new, that every experience is fresh, even when we are tired, depressed and frustrated. This insight on its own rejuvenates the observation as its not like watching a TV show over and over, although it may seem like it. Its always different, perennially interesting and an opportunity to learn and understand some amazing things.

Choose your yarn.,
Pull five feet of yarn out of the skein.,
Cast on your first stitch.,
Knit your first row.,
Transfer the stitches back to the right arm for your second row.,
Bind off the stitches.,
Weave in the ends.",How to Arm Knit a Blanket," Arm knitting requires no needles or other equipment, just some yarn and your own two arms. However, it is important to choose yarn that will be bulky enough to complete your project. One option is to purchase yarn that is super bulky and meant for arm knitting. You can find this type of yarn in a craft store.If you can’t find super bulky yarn, then you can also use three strands of bulky yarn held together to arm knit your blanket.The amount of yarn you will need will depend on how large you want your blanket to be. Plan on needing at least a three skeins of super bulky yarn to complete this project. If you are going to hold together three strands from three bulky skeins to knit your blanket, then you will need at least nine skeins of bulky yarn.;
, To begin casting on, pull about five feet of yarn out of the skein. This is the tail of your yarn, which you will use to cast on your first row of stitches. Allow the yarn to drop onto your lap or onto the floor beside you.Five feet is enough to cast on about 18 stitches for a small blanket. If you want to make a large blanket, then pull out a bit more, like six or seven feet of yarn.

, Start by making a slipknot with some of the yarn from the five foot length of yarn you pulled out. Start near the skein and work downwards. To make a slipknot, make a loop in the yarn and then pull a second loop of yarn through this loop. Then, slip this loop onto your right arm. This will be your first cast on stitch. Continue to loop the yarn and pull loops through to create more cast on stitches. Slip these stitches onto your arm as you go.
Continue casting on until you have at least 18 stitches on your arm. This will make a small blanket or throw.If you want a larger blanket, then try casting on 24 to 30 stitches.

, Knitting on your arms uses the same basic technique as knitting with needles. However, it can be more challenging at first since you will be using your fingers to create the new stitches.


To knit the first row, take the free end of the yarn (set the tail aside) and loop that yarn around your hand. Then, insert this loop into the first loop on your right arm. As you pull the loop through, slide the old loop off your right arm and slide the new loop onto your left arm.Continue to knit the stitches in this way until you reach the end of the first row.

, As you knit using your arms, you will be transferring the stitches from one arm to the other. That means that if you started on your right arm, then you will be transferring the stitches over to your left arm by the end of the first row, and then back to your right arm by the end of the second row.Continue knitting until you have achieved the desired length.

, You will need to bind off the stitches to finish the blanket. As with knitting using needles, you will be casting off by knitting the first two loops and then pulling each loop through the one that is behind it.For example, start by knitting the first two loops in your row. Then, stop knitting and grasp the first loop in your row with your fingers. Pull this loop up and over the second loop on your hand so that it is secured and you only have one loop on your hand.
To continue casting off, follow the pattern of knitting one and looping the first loop over the second loop until you reach the end of the row. As you cast off, you should never have more than two loops on your casting off arm.

, After you have cast off the final loop, pull the free end of the yarn through the loop. Then, weave the tail end of the yarn through the loops on the edge of the blanket to hide it.You can also tie the end of the yarn in a knot going through one of the stitches to secure it.


Trim off any excess yarn from the tail and your blanket is complete!

Figure out what you would like to forget.,
Think about what bothers you the most about the memory.,
Erase the memory with a ritual release.,
Remove your ""trigger objects."",
Consider hypnosis.",How to Purposefully Forget Things1," Before you can forget a memory, you will need think about the details of that memory. Doing so might be hard, but it is necessary. Write out your answers to the following questions to figure out the details of the memory:


what happened?
who was involved?
where and when did it happen?
what else was going on?
how did you feel?;
, Your next step is to pinpoint the most upsetting parts of the memory. Getting to the root of what bothers you the most will help you figure out what you need to forget. Write these specific things down so that you can work on forgetting them.


Keep in mind that you can't forget the existence of your ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend, but you can forget particular dates, events, or sense memories. For example, you might be able to forget the smell of a perfume, your first date, or something that your ex said to you.
If you find yourself dwelling on traumatic experiences, list the people who harassed you, the specific locations that caused you grief, and other sensory details like the smell of the lunchroom, the locker room, or the gym.

, You can use the details that you have identified to perform a ritual release. A ritual release is a mental exercise that may help you to forget a memory.To do a ritual release, all you have to do is turn your memory into a mental snapshot and imagine that you are setting it on fire.


In your mind, picture a part of the memory that you want to forget. Try to imagine this detail like a picture. Then, imagine that you are setting that picture on fire.Imagine the edges of the photo turning brown and curling up, then turning black and crumbling away. Imagine the fire burning your mental memory picture until the picture is gone.
You could also try using another image in place of the actual memory. For example, you could imagine your bully as a Honda Civic sinking into a pond or as a freight train slowly crashing into a wall.

, Certain objects or images may trigger a painful memory for you and make it harder to forget the memory.If you have any objects or pictures that trigger bad memories for you, then put them somewhere out of sight or consider getting rid of them.


For example, you may want to get rid of anything that reminds you of your ex, including photographs and gifts your ex gave you.

, You might also find that hypnosis can help you to forget unwanted memories. Hypnosis requires you to enter a relaxed state so that you will be more open to suggestions.Look for a professional hypnotist in your area if this is something that you would like to try.


Keep in mind that not everyone can be hypnotized, so it might not work for you. For those who can be hypnotized, there is also the chance that the effects will only last a short time."

Try thinking about unpleasant details while doing pleasant things.,
Make some new memories.,
Find ways to improve on bad memories.,
Consider talking to a therapist.",How to Purposefully Forget Things2," One way to overcome the bad feelings associated with a memory is to teach yourself to associate the unpleasant memory with good things.Your goal is to make these painful memories less painful through positive association.


Do something that makes you happy while thinking about a bad memory. For example, you could reflect on the embarrassment you felt when you broke up with your partner while listening to soothing music. Or, take a comfortable bath with scented candles while thinking about a time that you lost your job.
If positive association does not seem help, then you can try also listening to loud white noise to drown out painful memories. Consider surrounding yourself with radios all turned to static, or other white noise generators while meditating on the painful memories.

, Another great way that you can get rid of old memories is to get out and form some new ones. Even if you're not doing things related to the memory you'd like to forget, forming new memories will push the things you want to forget out of the way.Some things you can do to start forming new memories include:


take up a new hobby

read a new book
watch a movie
find a new job

make some new friends

, You may be able to replace a memory that you want to forget by building new memories that are similar to the old one.Try to seek out ways to experience positive things that are similar to the memory that you want to forget. After a while, your mind will start crossing its pathways and the original memory won’t be as strong.


For example, if you want to forget a trip you took to San Francisco, consider making another trip to San Francisco or take a trip to somewhere near there. Visit Berkley, Oakland, or Palo Alto. During your trip, buy new t-shirts, take new beach photos, and check out new restaurants.
If your ex's cologne is stuck in your mind, head to the fragrance counter. Smell every single kind of men's cologne you can, clogging your mind with new scents and different kinds of fragrance.
Go on dates. If you are bothered by memories of an ex, maybe going on a date will help you to move on and make some new good memories.

, If you are unable to forget or overcome negative feelings because of a bad memory, then it might be a good idea to seek the help of a therapist. A therapist can help you to deal with your emotions regarding a memory so that you can move on with your life.

Find out the ways you can best view intention as it happens.,
Consider and try to identify two main types of intention.,
Look at the role intention plays in relation to action.,
Explore how perception shapes intention.,
Think about how intention affects objects.,
Consider why people generally don't notice intention.,
Test this gradually.,
Find out how far intention goes in the actions it covers.,
Decide on whether you can influence intention, be it emotional or psychological types of intention, or bodily function types or intention.,
Continue to evaluate intention.",How to Explore and Study Intention," Meditation, particularly walking meditation, is excellent for this subject, but you can find other means such as observation and consideration in day-to-day activity. You can study the mind and mental themes, the body and body processes, or all of them together if you wish.


In some cases this is often referred to as mindfulness, which is probably the most in-depth and practical way to study this subject as it is essentially an awareness of things in the moment as they happen.;
, For lack of better words we could separate them into ""body functional"" and ""emotional/psychological"" types for the purpose of exploring this topic.


For example, you may feel hungry and intend to find a meal which is aimed at meeting a bodily need, but the choice as to how to prepare the food is a more emotional or psychological one. Consider if you are (for example) hungry and you have a tomato - would you have it in a salad, in a pasta sauce, fried, or in a sandwich? (And so forth.) Once you have decided, you would need to prepare it and gather the right tools (this means there are new intentions behind your actions in gathering the tools) to be able to process the tomato into a meal. But the bodily function doesn't really care, as a tomato is food be it raw or cooked.
There are also existing meditation practices devoted to these two types of intention, known as: body mindfulness and mental mindfulness, investigate or try those to see if they help you.

, Intention runs consistently before action and this can be seen such as when you have no intention to do anything at all – you can easily just sit and vegetate until you feel the need to do something such as eat, go to the toilet/bathroom, or find something to do if boredom strikes.


Reaction is not really different as it still does have its own mental processes that still come before the response, they are just much faster due to the urgency. This is often because the mind acts separately without needing any intellectual analysis, preferences or commentary - such as if when a person senses something approaching their head, they typically blink, duck, or block with their hands (etc). This too is a body-functional intention as mental processes do not all run at the same speed - some are much faster than others, but the mind has to intend to blink, duck, or block (etc), as without the mind being aware and being able to knit the information together to make an instruction to the body how to react, a reaction wouldn't happen.

, Perception shapes urgency, so if it perceives danger or pain, it adds greater importance and urgency to the action. Likewise, if perception informs you not to like something, such as feeling bored, or hungry, perception then influences intention to want to do something about the negative feeling.


Likewise consider other things that can affect intention, positively such as insight or negatively such as prejudice.
Similarly how perception can receive a sensation (mental or physical), then from that feeling make a reaction, and how our preferences or personal perception & opinions can affect intention positively or negatively should be considered.

, For example, a knife can be used in surgery to treat the wounded, or in day-to-day tasks such as cooking, or in artistic tasks such as carving but at the same time, it can also be applied to harmful acts like killing, injuring or threatening people. The knife itself is just a lump of metal, no more evil or innocent than any other object human beings (or natural causes) have created - in itself it doesn't have a character or conscience before, during or after it is used. Intention in design and manufacture can certainly make it look like it has a character or a power of its own, but it's still just metal that might make other things.

, Intention happens many thousands of times in thousands of little ways. For example, when typing words, the mind intends to type each letter in order, so that it acts very quickly in order to cause the words to be typed accurately by the fingers.


This example can be expanded. Knowing where the keys are is important to be able to type each letter so the mind has to intend to move the hands to each letter's space on the keyboard, to press it and release it, then move on to the next letter, all while glancing at the screen occasionally to ensure it is correct and at the same time breathe, see, smell, feel, etc. This is high speed intention to do each part, but the mind does it all on its own.

, As each action can be broken down into many smaller actions, there is intention behind each one, and sometimes many intentions happening very quickly. You may intend to move your hand to pick up a glass, but you have to keep the ""moving the arm and hand to pick up the glass"" intention until you perceive you have touched the glass by sight and/or feel. Then that intention dies away as you don't need it anymore, and a new intention to lift the glass to your lips comes into action (or you can change direction and intend not to pick it up but then let go of it).


It's much like a movie. The moving picture displayed on the screen happens because light is shown through a strip of thousands of static images all in an order showing their subtle changes; this strip is put through a projector and run at high speed - high enough to trick the mind to make many still pictures into a flowing, moving image. The mind simply isn't aware that the moving image on the screen is made of a lot of little images, like a day is just a flow of many thousands of little intentions and actions.

, If you don't intend to do something, the body can force you to do it by feeling pain, exhibiting fear, anxiety, or distress, or feeling hot or cold, and so forth. However, intention is a conscious thing. For example, you can manipulate the manner in which you breathe and indeed, you can intend to stop breathing and simply hold your breath, or stop moving the muscles that make the lungs expand and contract. Likewise, you can intend to not use the toilet or bathroom. In each case though, the body very quickly starts to protest at this and forces you to breathe again, or to use the toilet as needed. Yet, at the same time there are certain processes we cannot intentionally change, such as our heartbeat, digestive processes, aging, blood processing, oxygen absorption through the lung tissue and getting rid of carbon dioxide, expelling bodily waste products that soon become toxic through sweating to cool down etc. The body needs to do some of these things to stay alive and healthy.

, Given that there are many hundreds of intentions, there are many that can be changed for the better and for the wiser, such as in the case of an intention to be hateful or greedy, manic, or lazy. If you keep observing your intentions until you can see the intention making you think, feel or act, you can also seek to modify that intention, simply by using a conscious intention of a different kind, such as intending to let go of a harmful chain of thought.

, Try to see if some intentions are stronger than others which may trump another intention (such as you may intend to make a phone call, but the intention to go to the toilet/bathroom is stronger, so it trumps the desire to make a phone call). Sometimes unskillful or harmful intentions (such as thinking about a thought that makes you depressed, worried or angry) can be pretty strong intentions, so it needs a gentle, compassionate but equally more dedicated and stronger intention to be both kind to yourself and to enable you to let go of the stressful thoughts or feelings. By observing the process, it's not long before you can be adequately disenchanted with a harmful intention, thought or feeling in order to outweigh it, and eventually this will become your new ""habitual"" approach to the negative thought or feeling. It is all about building your understanding of intention into a useful tool.


As always, knowledge is only of use if you do something with it. Find out if you can shape your intentions in order to make your life more happy, healthy and less harmful. Can you train yourself to intend to be happier, healthier and intend to avoid or let go of harmful things? Only by exploring it and studying your interaction with intentions can you find out.

Understand that you are starting a lifelong journey.,
Start reading and learning.,
Choose a type of .,
Expand and evolve your thinking.,
Be patient and allow your ideas to percolate over time.,
Talk to others interested in philosophy.,
Actively find/seek out new experiences to help you to see things in different ways and from different angles.,
Keep reading philosophy.,
Keep up to date with the world.,
See yourself as a philosopher, whether or not you work as one.,
Try as much as possible to live up to your thoughts, even when you are experiencing something uncanny that may distract you from your opinions.",How to Form a Philosophy," Commit to being open-minded and flexible. Every conscious person has a philosophy. Individual philosophies can be simple, developing, or well-developed. A personal philosophy is a fundamental and integrated understanding about existence and your relationship to all related issues. Discovering and developing one's philosophy requires self-awareness, a desire to understand, and the will and ability to learn. Commit to looking for meaning and discern what makes sense. Your goal is to start on a path of personal growth that will evolve and mature as you pursue the love of wisdom (philosophia) for that is what philosophy means.;
, Start with what interests you and try to get a sense of the big ideas that philosophers are concerned with. As you learn look for connections between ideas and subjects to find coherence and/or arguments. This is akin to putting a jigsaw puzzle together; some pieces will fit and others won't.

, Philosophical thought is organized around many types of philosophies including: axiology, ontology, aesthetics, epistemology, ethics, logic, metaphysics and political theory. Follow your interests. Feel free to choose more than one type because you see particular linkages. You will enjoy thinking through how to meld them successfully.


After deciding a philosophy type, learn the background history of your chosen philosophy, including readings from the key philosophers. Understand the key questions that were addressed and get a solid understanding of the key concepts.
Improve your basic understanding of other types of philosophies. You cannot be an expert in everything but recognize that there is great value in understanding the basics of what others have done. A broad understanding of what people are struggling with and what the discussions have been about will help you to develop your own personal philosophy. Feel free to learn and build on existing ideas. It is difficult starting from scratch, so why not take another philosopher's ideas as a basic framework to get started? Many well known philosophers started like this. For example Plato took the undoubtedly oral and sociable Socratic method from the real Socrates, and used it as the basis for his highly polished literary Socratic method, which in turn was taken by Aristotle to form the basis of Logic particularly syllogisms.

, The framework you have selected is a starting point. As you experience life, test it out and see what works for you and what doesn't. When you have time analyze this and refine your framework philosophy. Over time, as you solve problems and assess the quality of the decisions you have made, you will be able to evolve from where you started into something autonomous of the original philosophy.


Become a critical thinker. Keep track of where you have obtained the basis for ideas, tenets, theories, etc., in your new philosophy. Being able to trace your theorizing or conclusions back to their source will help you defending your ideas or pushing them further. Very little develops in a vacuum.
Referring to what other philosophers have said gives your philosophy greater credibility because you are displaying your depth of knowledge and understanding of existing philosophies.

, When you have spare time, analyze the framework of your nascent philosophy, and try to find problems and solutions. Taking the development of your philosophy gradually will allow it to evolve into something autonomous of the original philosophy.



Keep a journal and continue writing down your thoughts and ideas, even if they're not coherent. Patience is essential because it may take you years to sort through all the discarded notions to find the treasure buried underneath. The passage of time is healthy, as it allows your ideas to keep evolving and to be tested by daily events.
Ask some pertinent questions, such as:

What is the purpose of your philosophy? Do you want to apply it to all of society or just a sector?
What is your role in your philosophy? What, if any, are the roles of particular people in your philosophy?
How will you explain the basis of your philosophy to others? Is it helpful on a practical level, or Utopian?
How do other belief sets or philosophies fit in with or go against your philosophy?
Are you willing to write down a thesis or book of your philosophy? Or would you rather write stories that contain your philosophy but are not overtly a philosophical work in structure?



, They can point out faults you might have missed and give different solutions. This is helpful for developing your philosophy.


Join a local philosophy group, club, or chapter.
Join an online group that has private forums where you can share your ideas freely and get responses.
Visit your local university and ask to speak with philosophy professors to share your thoughts with them.
If you find someone else who really understands where your new philosophy is headed, embrace their enthusiasm but take care to keep working on your understandings separate from their enthusiasm. It is hard to follow someone else while they are still working out what it is that they believe, so their enthusiasm may just be because they like and trust you.

,



Keep an open mind.

Learn to accept criticism and grow from it; it might just help strengthen you and your philosophy.
Always have a pencil and a notebook to note down ideas as they occur to you, or you come across them.

, It will allow you to see previous philosophers' attempts, what they found, and what fallacies they fell into; thus, progressing your own philosophy. This will also help you to see whether or not you are attempting something that a previous philosopher has already tried.

, Try reading a newspaper once in a while. It'll help you apply theories to real situations.


For example, take a serious news story that involves issues impacting on many sectors of society and ask yourself: ""What would I have done?"" Work your answers into your developing philosophy to see if it can withstand actual events and provide explanations, instruction, or greater understanding.

, A career in philosophy, or similar roles such as a researcher in a think-tank or institute, will ensure you dedicate regular time to your philosophy, but for the part time philosopher make sure you dedicate enough time to it so you keep improving and don't forget bits of your work.

, Get back to those notes that you have made about your philosophy or the inspiring books that you have been reading. It'll help.

Gain education on the typical effects of bipolar disorder on the family.",How to Deal with a Bipolar Family Member," For example, a person who is chattering on about themselves selfishly or bragging is normally recognized as arrogant or self-centered. This behavior in a person with bipolar disorder is a sign of mania, as are other risky behaviors that may be equally unappealing to you. Recognizing that this is a symptom of the illness, and not an intentional behavior by your family member is helpful in understanding their condition. However, be cautious not to associate every mood your family member has with their illness; people with bipolar disorder can be mad or sad in healthy ways, too.


One way you can understand your family member's illness better and show support is to simply ask about their experience of it. Make sure, however, that you use discretion and identify if they feel comfortable talking with you about it before you attempt to engage them. If this is too threatening, you could simply ask how they are doing and gain more information about what they are currently going through.;
, Since bipolar disorder is best treated with medication and therapy, it is crucial to be supportive of your family member engaging in treatment. One way to become involved is to participate in your loved one’s psychotherapy. Family therapy can be a helpful resource in supporting an individual with bipolar disorder.


Communicate with your family member’s mental health care provider. If your loved one has signed a release for you to speak with their therapist or doctor, you can notify that person about possible concerns or problems as they arise. You can also gain more information on how to assist your family member.
If your family member is not currently receiving mental health treatment, you can encourage or help them to seek treatment. PsychologyToday.com.and the American Psychological Association (APA)are both helpful resources. You can search for therapists or psychiatrists in your area who specialize in bipolar disorder. However, be careful not to push treatment on your family member if they are reluctant (unless they are potentially harmful to herself or others); this can scare them off and disrupt your relationship.

, It is common for individuals with bipolar disorder to avoid taking their medication since the “high” of mania can feel good to them. If you notice that your family member has gone off their medication, the first step would be to notify their psychiatrist or general practitioner as soon as possible. Most likely the doctor will want to speak with your loved one and will inform you of how to proceed. If you are not able to speak with a doctor, you can encourage your loved one to take their medications, or provide incentives (such as special treats or doing something with them that they enjoy) if they agree to be med-complaint.

, If you notice signs that your family member may be experiencing an episode, it is crucial to engage them in harm reduction.


Negotiate to reduce harm during risky behaviors (gambling, excessive spending, drug abuse, reckless driving)
Keep children, disabled people, and other vulnerable people away so that the antics do not disturb them
Speaking with your loved one's medical health clinician, or calling an ambulance or suicide hotline if they are at risk of harming themselves or others

, It is important to have an action plan for dealing with an emergency to effectively de-escalate a crisis. Have contact info of important relatives who can help, as well as doctor’s numbers and hospital addresses. Do not just store this information in your phone in case it loses battery; you should have these numbers written down and on you at all times (such as in a wallet or purse). Give a copy to your family member. You could even develop this plan together when your family member is emotionally stable.

, A trigger is a behavior or situation that may increase the likelihood of a negative outcome, in this case, a manic, hypomanic, or depressive episode. Possible triggers include substances such as caffeine, alcohol, and other drugs.Triggers can also include negative emotions such as stress, an imbalanced diet, sleep irregularities (sleeping too much or too little), and interpersonal conflicts. Your loved one will have their own specific triggers. You can help by discouraging your family member from engaging in these behaviors, or by helping them prioritize their responsibilities to reduce stress levels.


Criticism and critical people are common bipolar triggers.
If you live with your family member you could remove substances such as alcohol from the home. You could also attempt to foster a relaxing environment by controlling lighting, music, and energy levels.

, The more educated you become about bipolar disorder, the more understanding and accepting you can be. While it may still be a challenge to cope with this disorder in the family, your concern and thoughtfulness can go a long way in supporting your family member.


One way to show that you care is by simply letting your family member know that you are there for them, and you want to be supportive of their recovery. You can also offer to listen to them if they want to talk about their illness.

, Putting yourself in your family member’s shoes is a helpful way to increase your understanding of their behavior as well as to reduce your negative emotions about or reactions to their mental health. Allow yourself to imagine what it would be like to wake up unaware if that day you would be plummeted into depression or elevated into a frenzied state of energy.

, Caring for a loved one with bipolar disorder can sometimes lead to stress and depressive symptoms.Remember that you can only begin to help someone else if you first maintain your own physical and mental health. Be aware of your own behaviors and your underlying feelings about your family member.


Give up control. It is important to understand and remind yourself (either aloud or in your mind) that you cannot control your family member's behaviors. They have a condition that you cannot fix.
Shift your attention to focusing on your own needs. For example, you could make a list of your own personal goals and begin working toward them.
Use coping resources. Coping resources are specific ways to cope with a particular issue, and they are vital to self-care. Coping strategies can include activities you enjoy such as reading, writing, art, music, outdoor activities, exercise or sports. Therapeutic activities can also assist self-care including relaxation techniques (such as progressive muscle relaxation), meditation, keeping a journal, mindfulness, and art therapy. Another way to cope is to create distance or remove yourself from stressful situations when they arise.

, If you find that you are having a difficult time coping with your family member’s symptoms of bipolar disorder, it may be beneficial to receive your own therapy. Evidence suggests that gaining family therapy, not just education, can help individuals (especially caregivers/parents) deal with having a family member with bipolar disorder., This means it has a strong genetic component and tends to run in families. Therefore, it is not the fault of your family member any more than it would be if hey had a medical condition. Bipolar Disorder is not something your family member can control through will-power alone., There are two main types of bipolar disorder, Bipolar I Disorder and Bipolar II Disorder. It is important to identify which type your family member has to understand their particular symptoms and behaviors.


Bipolar I is evidenced by a person experiencing manic episodes that typically last a week or longer. Some symptoms of a manic episode include: heightened/irritable mood, exaggerated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness, distractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, and engaging in risky behaviors (such as gambling or having unprotected sex with multiple partners).Bipolar II is evidenced by at least one major depressive episode as well as a least one hypomanic episode (similar to a manic episode, but less severe and can last as little as four days)., Bipolar disorders are typically treated with a combination of medication and therapy. Psychiatrists or general practitioners often prescribe mood stabilizers such as Lithium to reduce the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Psychologists, Marriage and Family Therapists (MFTs) and other clinicians typically assist the individual with bipolar disorder in managing and coping with their symptoms. Typical types of therapies include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family Therapy, and Interpersonal Therapy., Family members of individuals with bipolar disorder may experience burden and lack of energy. Additionally, spouses of individuals with bipolar disorder may experience a lack of support, and many do not seek help.If a family member believes that the person with bipolar has control over their illness this can lead to feelings of burden and dissatisfaction with the relationship."
"
Consider a bold theory for starters, namely that voidness or emptiness occurs because it is in-between what is ""there"" to us.,
Examine other living things.,
Consider non-living things.,
Look for evidence of a beginning which shows the mark of a scheduled plan.,
Work out what your feelings are in relation to the idea of void, such as whether you find the idea of voidness scary, comforting, or strange, and so forth.,
Look where new emotions point you.,
See how you can use your thinking and experiences to improve your life and make the world a better place.,
Finally, remember above all this: In a world void of pre-determined meaning, you are free to make your own.",How to Explore Voidness and Live Beyond It," What we normally consider as ""us"" or ""me"" is an accumulated collective of memories, knowledge, habits, culture and beliefs (etc.) but the foundation for all of our consciousness is without a ""True"" or pre-determined meaning, theme, or background, and remains only an assumption made by our individual brains.


Consider seeing the world for the first time, then consider the knowledge and experience that has created all the layers that makes you as a person say ""this is me and mine"". Yet even as a baby, there are countless psychological processes and interactions that result in a ""you"" that was there before you were born. If you were to take away all these aspects of ""you,"" anything that remains would be meaningless, or inhuman, to you.
If you were to remove all your memories, habits and all the things you identify as you, you could not consider what is left behind because it is no longer within the realm of mundane human understanding and ideas. In essence, the identity of a person is dependent on a large variety of internal and external factors, each of them impermanent and often acting individually, or without our direct awareness and if these individual processes were put aside there is no remainder. This philosophy may seem concerning because it requires us to re-examine and re-evaluate many of the cultural and personal ideas and attachments we have.;
, Just as animals react to similar things that we do (such as reacting to hunger, or feelings, or temperature, or to being confronted by an attacker), animals can also plan and remember (elephants have exceptional memory for places, gorillas can learn to communicate using human methods, crows recognize human faces and communicate this to other crows, predators maintain hunting grounds, etc). Note the similarities between human beings and their animal cousins, how connected we are in our daily patterns and motivations, and how little difference there is between us all.


We could pinpoint language as a unique trait, but then dogs bark and howl, birds twitter and squawk and there is a wide range of animal body language such as baring teeth, tensing and ""puffing up"" which some animals (including humans) use to seem bigger and stronger, etc. Words are just like programming code, but body language is far more deeply ingrained, like firmware to language's software. Consider that other animals have similar characteristics and functional abilities based in the genetic coding responsible for our hardware.

, Is there purpose in stones, water, or even the world? Probe your own response to this question, as underneath your assertions are a great many assumptions about the nature of the world and reality. The concept of Void-ness would remind you that each assumption must be examined and its own arbitrary, all-together human foundation recognized, until nothing remains.


Socrates is possibly best known for the paraphrased quote, ""I am the wisest, because only I know that I know nothing."" There is a hidden meaning to this paradox in that it is not a paradox at all. It is not one answer or the other, but each reciprocally answering the other, never settling on a single ""Answer."" Mastering this is key to understanding the Void.
Consider the scale of the universe from its galaxies and stars down to the tiny bacteria, atoms and subatomic particles. All these things change, are impermanent and are independently in motion. Consider how the planets are racing though space around the Sun or other stars. If you keep expanding this perspective to take the stars into account and any planets they may have, is there evidence or not of some plan or a great mover of those stars and planets, as opposed to physics? Try to consider a weighted average between your experience and the views of others in this regard.







, If it were possible to set things in motion such as starting a spinning top and then letting it go, are there any demonstrable patterns that evidence where they are intended to end up?
Voidness by nature puts into stark contrast that many of these ""design"" or ""plan"" questions may never be resolved, because part of the question was without basis in what is actually occurring. Voidness in practice requires a person to put aside these questions in order to prevent bias or selective observation and that a person without opinion, desire or preferences, observe that things are simply as they are.

It might be possible that the universe was purposefully set in motion and left to its own devices, much like a spinning top, but then it might also be possible for the forces of physics to start it and keep it going without assistance. It is a consistent variation between two main philosophies, either (a) One option is that some entity set all of reality in motion or (b) Another option is that physics, every particle/wave, is acting as it must, void of plan or controller, impermanent, changing and dynamic responding to cause and effect and that a true singular beginning is simply not evident but is a result of continuous change. Each option has demonstrable evidence in the eyes of individual observers, however in this instance it is important to be aware when the observation and interpretation of such evidence is selective and/or relative. Therefore a person must observe it as it is, without bias or shaping.
Try to find out which approach you consider most apt, either by studying the vast universe and physics, or life and the terrestrial animals of Earth, but always looking for a pattern or demonstrable evidence to support your theories. Einstein proved, to his own satisfaction at least, that everything came from nothing.
Your own evaluations matter in your search for the truth, as well as the views of others, but it is wise to not depend on any one view for exploring your mind and the world. The Buddha, who spoke much on the subject, described the varying and opposing philosophies of his day (many of which are mainstream today), as ""A jungle of views, a tangle of views"". While many tried to juggle and cut their way through them to find the facts for themselves, the Buddha realised it was necessary to abandon those which did not match what was real, even if it was an enchanting or self-empowering philosophy. If a person was to continue to hold on to a firm set belief or hypothesis during their search for the facts, or searching for an answer to a question tied to a belief structure, they would not be able to have both.
Philosophy therefore is about the scientific process of observation and analysis in relation to personal experiences and should not be about reaching absolute certainty. While the laws of physics can be highly transcendental and enlightening, it is the rare minority who go down that path as it is not self-empowering, nor inclining towards power or debate. The concepts of the words ""absolute certainty"" are themselves neither absolute, nor certain, due to the universal nature of impermanence and change.
As it has been aptly said, ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"", a person intent on researching this subject must not only consider both options to a deep level, not a trivial level, but at the same time accept that while there is many interpretations of life and the universe, there is only this reality which is as it is.

, If you feel anything at all, try to find out what and why, as well as how it influences your perception of all other things in life.

, See if that changes anything. You might find that if you feel uncomfortable, it might be because you're handling a new idea, but that's a good thing – allow yourself to be stretched intellectually. Then ask yourself whether those feelings influence what you believe to be the nature of existence.


If you find the idea is liberating, scary in its implications, or want to see if your conclusions can be tested, then look outside into the world. Stay mindful of the ideas you are looking for, see if their patterns repeat with any significance in reality.

, Consider in what way you will move beyond the voidness to continue engaging with the world by letting go of ""socially constructed"" thoughts and feelings and looking beyond them.

, We have no choice about dying at some point, but we get to choose how to live. It is important to remember that by avoiding making our own path in order to follow another's interpretation or opinions, we never develop deeply as human beings and life remains without depth. Potentially living with information that is all second hand as we have made no discoveries or insights of our own. The knowledge gained by exploring Voidness is knowing what promotes a happy, healthy and peaceful life, and what results in stress, illness and strife. There can be power, dignity, and honor in thinking for oneself and to co-exist in harmony with one's environment. Good luck and have fun!

Determine when and where words are used.,
Test to see how you react to words.,
Consider that we can be controlled or manipulated by words.,
Look at the levels words take.,
Consider how words help you and can be not only useful, but beautiful.,
Explore the mental world of words.,
Look at everything again for the first time without using words.",How to Explore Words and Live Beyond Them," As a basic starter, words are often used primarily to identify or label things, and then to describe and communicate these things both to ourselves and other people. Yet, the word is not the thing; the use of words is about being able to share an ""idea"" or feeling of the thing with others, the words linking us with the object existing in the world and the concept in our mind. But there are many other uses for words, such as sharing an abstract idea with others (like globalization) or to explain our relationship to people or objects, in a code form to be able to talk about subjects secretively and many others so try to explore those uses too. Consider also what makes you want to break out into words.


The immediate point of exploring the usage of words is that words don't need to be used all the time. We might say ""It's a tomato"" but the word tomato is not actually the thing, it's just a label and indeed many languages have different labels. We give and gain emotions with words in many cases, such as the word love, but love is far more than words, as are all the other feelings and ideas.
Sometimes the use of words may be used to modify other feelings. We may vent our anger by expressing with words and the amount of intention or stress of those words, while studies have shown that we can tolerate pain longer by using very strong words. The frequency or selection of words often can be chosen by neural pathways - if we use a word a lot it is virtually a mental habit, but there are cases where we get an emotional or biological response by selecting words.
Sometimes the use of words can confuse and obfuscate the point being made because we have differing perceptions dependent on the words used. Consider, for example, cross-cultural exchanges of words with speakers who have many words for rain (the Celtic Irish), many words for water (the Hopi) or many words for cooking the same food item (the Japanese). There are also many languages where words may have a gender of its own, or to be used only by certain genders, changing subtly or largely for the opposite sex. In these cases, the words used can give rise to very different perceptions dependent on the speaker's and listener's viewpoint. Words have allowed these cultures to be far more specific and descriptive on one level, but at the same time can prevent communication more broadly.;
, We also instill words with emotions but frequently, the word can act as a prompt in the brain to generate the same feeling, and vice versa, the mind reacts first which prompts a common word to express that feeling. Many words create an instant feeling, such as ""violent"" or ""cozy"" or ""delicious"". Words actually prompt the mind to feel something in our body.
Sometimes the misuse, pronunciation, incorrect spelling (in writing) or grammar of words may affect people to quite a high extent.


A simple example was if you read ""the article was about how to do something"" but a tiny change to: ""the article was about who to do something"" it suddenly makes no sense and is confusing, or ""the article was about how to do Something"" now can have a hugely different meaning - simply with one letter out of place or changed. ""about the article was something how to do"", strictly speaking has no changes at all, except their order. Consequently, words can make a subtle effect when the words aren't quite the same and can make a further effect if they are in bold, italics or underlined.
Try this simple test to see how the mind reacts to word groups. Examine some of the following word groups and see if they create any feelings or thoughts in you. 1. ""Different, weird, foreign,"" 2. ""Famous, fashionable, exclusive."" 3. ""Yellow, simple, weather"". What do you feel about these words?
Now, add another word of your own choosing to those groups, did that change the associated feeling, or did you pick another word that meant the same, so the feeling stayed the same? The third group it is likely you would have felt confused and thought about a connection word to try to combine the others to make sense. Did the various feelings just happen on their own, or did the words prompt the mind to make those feelings?
If you found that they had no effect on you at all, try thinking about words that scare you, or that make you want something. Write them down and consider why those words made you feel anything. They are just bunches of letters and sounds after all, so what is it that makes you react to them?
A similar application example is that a person might label another person by their culture, age, gender, lifestyle, belief system (etc) and become uncomfortable about them, if not outright hostile. They might be perfectly ordinary and friendly people that in circumstances where no words have been spoken, one would be fine with this person, but suddenly that label causes an uncomfortable feeling to arise and words become objects (and, consequently identifiers) of prejudice and bias. The word itself has become an expression and a symbol of ill will and there can be further dislike and distrust complications, occasionally due to mis-interpreted words. It also works in the reverse––labels can make a person seem more attractive and interesting and we can feel a sense of desire or respect towards those who certain labels are attributed to.

, There is even a proper term known as ""neuro-linguistic programming"" (NLP), which can sometimes be very effective with both positive and harmful results. An example is we often are taught at an early age to avoid placing certain things in our mouths as they may be poisonous or a choke hazard which is a positive example, but it might affect us later, so after being told (for example) to avoid red berries, when confronted with a tray of strawberries and red-currants that we are likely to feel doubt as to if they are safe to eat. Many background examples come from our family, friends (etc) and often by external advertisers. This programming when we are young prompts us to act when older. It is used very often in politics with negative campaigning to try to prevent the opponent being elected by focusing on their faults to prompt fear or loathing in the public.
Likewise in a debate, it is considered essential to not only convince people effectively with words, but important strategically to move them towards the key point the debater wishes to make.
It's important to consider that its not always the events or things that worry us or cause us problems, but our mental opinions of them (words again) that cause us more stress. Some words in the mind make us feel angry and can be used by others deliberately or unconsciously to inflame or frustrate us, make us sad, confused or ashamed where if we had the choice, they wouldn't be happening. Some people may live in fear of words or being branded with them, such as the words ""failure"", ""dumb"", ""useless"" (etc).
Look for obsessions with certain words that you might have. There are schools of thought, philosophy and political ideology that are obsessed or addicted with specific words, which can be a hindrance to communication and looking beyond the scope to see what's really happening.
Words are used to classify things or to lend identity, status and belonging, but this has its disadvantages. It ultimately is important to explore how we can be manipulated by words, but not just by others, but positively by our own minds. The mind uses words or phrases repeatedly to reinforce an assumption or belief, often what happens is after a long time we accept it as true without ever considering if it may not be. Therefore; it is important to see why it needs to reinforce something, for if the assumption was true, then it would be evident. Very often the mind is misleading us, or we are misleading ourselves because we want to believe something.

, Some are functional words such as kitchen, pencil, walking, and so forth, which don't create much resonance with you, but some very selective words can provoke feeling. There are many areas that focus on taking advantage of your responses to words, mostly found in marketing.
Words are often more effective when used in rhymes or associated mnemonics that can aid memory. Try to spot words or the way words are structured and selected to prompt you to feel or act a certain way. Advertising and public relations (for example) tend to have very high levels of research to select words effectively. It may be a rhyme or ""jingle"", or a catchphrase, as well as the speaker's accent, tone and speed, that will entice you most to want to buy their product, remember their firm when you need equipment service or repairs or even to elect their politician. What is it about these words and how they are used that makes you want to buy or alternatively annoy/spur you enough into doing something?
Words ultimately are used by us as individuals as a support, foundation or component part of our identity that we use to reinforce our opinion of ourselves. A young teenager wouldn't want to be seen using words used by older people, or used by more intellectual people who aren't ""cool"" (another key word that is very important to people). The problem is when we become attached to words or certain words and forget that while the word is not the thing, words as symbols and tools effectively can use, abuse and control us because we value them and their meaning too highly.

, The goal here is not to destroy words utterly. There is beautiful poetry and knowledge also expressed in words, which we would be at a loss without. It is currently considered more or less impossible in dealing with everyday life to be without words, and language is an amazing, if imperfect thing. But words are something that we make in order to describe, identify or express what we see, feel, smell and so on. Endeavor to find out why words are such useful tools, particularly in the context of your daily life.
It is wise to consider in an educational context that words in a lesson, or the key message of a lesson only sinks in when it is relevant to a person. Often to get a major insight or moment when the penny drops and everything makes sense is when the right words are used at the right time and in the right order. Often a teacher may be pressing an important life message, or a trainer teaching a new employee safety techniques but it never sinks in when the listener or reader is not paying attention because the subject is not relevant or interesting at the time to be relevant. Words can be very effective when used wisely for impact by considering how to make the lesson strike relevance in the individual.
The goal for educators is therefore to measure against their own experiences to find out what makes the subject interesting to themselves, but also to see what does the student actually want and need? When the teacher understands themselves better, they improve their ability to instruct a student better and by using words far more effectively be a better educator.

, Ask yourself when you are having a long thought chain, ""Am I making or using these words? Are there cases where words happen randomly or in a pattern on their own?""
The answer is quite surprising if you examine your thoughts for long enough because words may be used as a pacifier, a distraction, or a way to keep you engaged over a subject, even if it causes you to feel stressed. Likewise the big question, ""Can I understand things without words?"" A big part of maturing or developing is consciously thinking without using the labels we are comfortable with, or uncomfortable with.try to explore the world without words. Can you understand something just by seeing or hearing it, experiencing without mentally describing, or having a running mental commentary? Experiment with this when feeling an emotion or seeing a scene, try not to describe it, but just let the emotion be and explore it, but explore it without words. While a person may say observe it in its pure form, the very word ""pure"" is another keyword that will affect that way you perceive things, so likewise should be put aside for this experiment. Use your other senses and see what effect they make.
When a word inevitably comes to mind, take a moment and replace it with an expanded understanding, and note where the word might have failed you. this can be particularly effective with generalities, like bad, good, etc. Also try physical feelings, just let them be and see what is happening. If words aren't helpful, then let them go in the same way that you would let go of a heavy bag. You might find that without the words, you might feel and see things more clearly, which helps to lead to a far richer understanding.


Language is constantly changing and developing. When this becomes apparent you can see that actually life and the world has always operated pretty well without words.

, See how much more you can explore life without them. Everything becomes new again; every image will be subtly different, every sound is different and so on because you are able to expand your mind and gain more from the experience - you can see more of the finer details and how much of the vast world we live in that we miss on a daily basis. You can reduce the amount of words you use when it is to your advantage, and see beyond them.

Create healthy emotional boundaries.,
Understand (but not necessarily agree with) their point of view.,
Have the conversation with your spouse or significant other.,
Be firm.,
Give reason(s) only if you wish to.,
Allow them their feelings of disappointment or grief.,
Remind them that having children should be a unanimous decision.,
Give careful and honest consideration to all suggestions.,
Support the youth in your family.",How to Defend Your Choice to Be Childless," No one has the authority to demand you have children--even your parents. Or grandparents. You have every right not to have a baby. If this is not what you want (or at least not now), you will have to assert yourself as an independent adult. This is often very, very difficult and fraught with emotional landmines.


Relatives may have a hard time letting go of control over you. This is not necessarily being done out of power-mongering. Understand you will always be their little loved one, and they want to spare you heartache. Plus, they want to prevent you from making mistakes. But part of being an adult is for you to make decisions about your life and body without their control, including decisions on childbearing (or not to produce children).
If you are a legal adult, you have every right to privacy regarding your reproductive choices. You do not need your mother to be privy to your choices to use birth control, for instance.
Likewise, you need to politely but firmly keep relatives out of your marriage or other relationship. Your grandmother may have her opinion that you and your spouse would regret not being parents, for instance -- but that does not mean she gets a vote.;
, There are several reasons people urge others to have babies:


Cultural. Traditionally, the entire point of adulthood in many cultures was to continue your bloodline. Your choice not to can be seen as an affront to these values, even if that is not how you feel.
Cultures that have experienced genocide (such as those of Jewish descent) may feel an additional pressure to have offspring.
Some families have a special cultural stake in having children. If you are the heir to a European aristocratic title, for instance. Or if you are the last direct descendant of a family line. Or you are part of a family-run business.
Faith. Some religions place a high value on having children. This may put you at odds with tenets of your faith.
Self-centered needs of others. Your mother cannot wait to be a grandmother, and may pressure you to have children to make that dream a reality. She loved being a mother, and wants you to experience the same joy, too. She may not be able to see that you have different wants, needs, and dreams, so she is not ""owed"" a grandchild by you.
""But what if you change your mind?"" Everyone knows or has heard of a person who did not want kids when younger, and then changed his or her mind later. Sometimes the ending is happy. Unfortunately, sometimes this realization may happen when it's ""too late"" to have children - such as a woman who put off having children until she was older and finds out she is now infertile, and regrets her procrastination now.

, If you are considering a long-term, committed relationship, one of the things you will have to confront is the question, ""Do we want children?"" If you two cannot agree on this point, you may not be compatible.


Be honest. If you do not desire a child, but your spouse does, it is best to know this before investing years in a relationship that simply may not work out.
This conversation must have ""only two people in the room"". That means the wishes, opinions, and dreams of your relatives must not factor in. If your significant other says something like, ""But I don't want to disappoint Mother..."" politely remind him or her that this is between the two of you, not anyone else.

, If you don't want to continue answering for the next 25+ years, you must stand firm to your choice. If you are married, tell your spouse to take the same kind but firm position as yours (get your story straight and stick to it). Being squishy and avoiding a direct answer will only give your relatives hope that you will recant one day. Say something very direct, like, ""I know you may not agree or understand, but we've made the decision not to have any children. We'll let everyone know if we ever change our minds.""

, The reasons for your decision are your own. You should feel compelled to explain only if you are comfortable and wish to divulge this information to your friends and family. If you don't want to explain, you are not required to do so.

, Maybe you are the last son, and therefore the family's last hope to carry the family name forward to a new generation. If you have no children, your family line will end with you. This can create a lot of pressure for you, and a lot of lost dreams for your family should you choose not to have any children. Or maybe you're a woman or man who has simply decided that she does not wish to be a mother (or father). Whatever your reasons are, compassionately understand that your family has dreamed of holding your children since you were a child yourself. Allow your family to grieve for their loss (yes, it is authentic grief, a loss to them of a kind) - you're not the only member of your family, and if you value your relationship with them, you must allow them their authentic sorrow. Your decision does affect them. You are entitled to live as you see fit, however, and the fact that they will be sad should not make you feel that you should become a parent if that is not what you want for your life.

, If there is any disagreement about whether or not to have children between the couple, the decision to remain child-free should prevail. Children should be brought only into homes that welcome, want, and cherish them without reservation.

, If you are dead set against having children, and, for example, you are the last surviving son in your family, unless your family has a history of congenital disease or mental illness, it wouldn't hurt you to hear them out if they come to you with suggestions for compromise. There may be a family suggestion as to how to carry on the family's name (you can always suggest that your sister allow her children to carry your family name instead of her husband's, for example). You don't have to do this at every gathering, but at least give your family's thoughts an honest hearing, and consider their suggestions - it will go a long way toward them feeling less hurt and also let them feel that they had their say in the matter. There is nothing that says you must take any of their advice or suggestions. Just remember that it's your life, not theirs, and they won't have the responsibility of any progeny of yours - you will.

, For child-free adults, this is a way to contribute to the family besides producing offspring. Children are a big responsibility, and having involved extended family members can make a huge difference. And it can also help family members understand that child-free does not necessarily mean selfish or self-centered. Some examples:


Babysit for your brother so he and his wife can have date nights.
Offer a summer internship to your niece.
Take your cousin on trips to broaden his horizons.
Help with day care tuition for your sister.
Encourage your nephew to take his drawing seriously.

"
Observe your relatives.,
Ultimately, what is the relative doing that causes you to feel that he or she is using passive aggressive behavior towards you?,
Evaluate the motives behind your relative's behavior.,
Be aware that one key motive behind passive aggressive behavior is to attack you, bring you down, pour scorn on you or show you up without retaliation coming back on the person.,
Don't let yourself become a part of the game play.,
Confront the relative openly and politely.,
Share your own feelings.,
Don't let your relative brush you off.,
Stop relying on this relative to do anything for you.",How to Deal with Passive Aggressive Relatives," See if you can identify the passive aggressive behaviors they're displaying. Be careful to take into account occasional lapses––from time to time we all behave passive-aggressively for such reasons as stress, exhaustion, fear or lack of assertiveness. The behavior becomes problematic when it's the constant way in which this person communicates and treats others. Some signs to look for include:


What is this relative saying? Complaining is a typical sign of passive-aggressive behavior. For example, complaints about being unappreciated and about their own misfortunes tend to be commonplace.
What is this relative doing? On the one hand, the relative seems to agree with you, then lo and behold, you discovered he or she went and did things completely the opposite!
How does the relative respond to new information or to the choices that you (or your siblings, cousins, etc.) have made in your life? Feigning disinterest or even outright ignoring the news, or criticizing or scorning your achievements under layers of ""wit"", sarcasm or joke cracking can be a sign of passive aggressive behavior. The passive aggressive person tends to distrust the success of others and will do a lot to downplay it or suggest that the success was a result of luck or cheating, rather than accepting that someone might have worked hard for it. It'll all be done very subtly though, so don't expect outright scorn.
Does your relative express disapproval or withhold positive reinforcement? The inability to give praise or acknowledge a job well done is a sign of resentment, a key underpinning of passive aggressive behavior.
Have you noticed the relative making snide comments but then acting as if he or she never said such a thing? Or even going so far as to accuse you of misinterpreting what has been said?
Is your relative being argumentative over almost everything you say or suggest? A lot of ""back chat"" which insists that they have things worse, know better or shine brighter can make for a very negative pattern. For example, saying such things as: ""No, no, no, that's not the case"" or ""Well, in my experience, that never happens"" or ""In my day we didn't even have that sort of chance and had to work hard for our supper"", etc.
Does your relative go on and on about how fortunate other people are and how unfortunate he or she is? Does this person use the dreaded words ""if only..."", then goes on to explain all that he or she could have done in life if all the stars had aligned correctly? In listening to this type of talk, it can soon feel that this person has an inability to accept that he or she has no responsibility for making beneficial changes in life.;
, Most times it is very subtle, although the more a passive aggressive person responds this way, the more it feels ""natural"" to him or her and the more blatant it can become over time. Determine what you find disturbing about their behavior. Is it that they don't agree with you, or is it the way they express their disagreement, i.e. gritting their teeth silently, then saying ""it's fine, dear"" when you ask them what is wrong?

, You may or may not know ""the grand narrative"" behind why your relative behaves passive aggressively but you will probably get enough snippets of what has upset your relative through the things he or she says. This should enable you to start building a bigger picture of what ails the person. Determine what disturbs you about this person's outlook on life and his or her attitude towards others in the family, especially those who have achieved things that this person feels resentful about.


Why is the person acting this way? Is it possible that Aunt Flo wanted desperately to be a prima ballerina in her younger years but was too poor and married too young to achieve this ambition, only to see a grandchild doing really well at ballet? Maybe Uncle Georgy wanted to be an astronaut but found studying the needed subjects too arduous, only to find years later that a nephew has been accepted to NASA. These are not excuses, they are ways of understanding the narrative that the relative has built their current reality on.
Do you think there is an understandable reason behind why your relative might not approve of something that is important to you? In some cases, a passive aggressive person is self-protecting initially from a bad experience but then projects this bad experience on loved ones in the hope of protecting them from a possible bad experience too. It can help to see that a gruff, scolding or nasty comment about your choices being wrong might well be coming from a place of care for you, however misplaced on their own personal bad experience.
In some cases, the passive aggressive relative is seeking to control you, the situation, the family, etc. This person may feel that his or her place in the family is somehow threatened and that by being passive aggressive, a covert attempt is made to restore the relative's power over others. There may even be a sense of satisfaction in knowing that their words or behavior causes another distress or second thoughts.
Another possible motive for passive aggressive behavior is simple jealousy. As with Aunt Flo and Uncle Georgy above, seeing someone else achieve in ways that the relative feels he or she has failed can be devastating and may even self-confirming of long-term failure to pursue dreams. In this case, resentment, bitterness and spite will likely fuel the motive behind the passive aggressive behavior.

, This is why sarcasm, jokes, all-knowing statements and false wisdom will often be used as a way to suggest that ""no harm was meant"", even though harm was the full intent.

, The most important part of dealing with a passive aggressive relative (and family ties do make the emotional heartstrings tug harder), is learning to not get annoyed. Rehearse good thinking patterns in your head before you come into contact with the particular relative again––a little mental role-playing can help you to avoid panicking and giving in to the subtle pressures.


Tell yourself something like: ""Granny is being passive aggressive again. I love her heaps but I won't let her mess with my head like this anymore. She is bitter about X but that won't impede me from doing what I have set out to do"". Or, ""Jon is being unfair and is trying to sabotage me by saying those things. I know he's behaving passive aggressively and if I get upset, he'll get what he wants. It won't change anything to worry or get annoyed about him. Instead, I'll either ignore the remarks or stand up for myself.""
Above all, stay calm. It can be easy to feel agitated or upset but this makes it likely that your response will be emotionally driven rather than calmly considered. Being calm will unnerve the passive aggressive person.

, Once you conclude that passive aggressive behavior is your relative's way of communicating (or not communicating) with you, and that is bothersome to you, respond. Wait until your relative does or says something passive-aggressive. Then, in a calm and friendly manner, ask ""Why do you say that or do that?"". If your relative pretends that he or she didn't do anything, say ""You said or did (repeat what they said or did) just now. Do you not like my idea (or does my story bother you)?""

, If your relative denies being bothered by anything, remain calm. Say something like: ""Well, when you said or did ... this made me feel rejected or silly, and it hurts my feelings."" This is a non-aggressive way to remain open to your relative and show him or her that the passive aggressive behavior matters to you. Your relative will then have to explain his or her actions.


Often, this is enough to encourage an open explanation or an apology, even if it is put forth in a gruff manner (i.e. ""I didn't mean to make you feel bad, I just worry about your finances or your future/etc."", or ""You know I love you, I don't have to say that all the time!"").
Follow up with ""I'm really glad you told me that"" or something similar. This is a high-pressure situation for him or her, so appreciate the little steps your relative is taking.

, If your relative retorts that you are just too sensitive, stand your ground––this sort of retort is a put-down and not reality. Tell your relative that you are genuinely interested in his or her opinion, even if he or she disagrees with you, and that you want your relative to be comfortable sharing thoughts with you. This will probably be surprising to your relative. Many passive-aggressive people act the way they do because they lack the confidence to express themselves and face possible disagreement. If you tell your relative that his or her opinion has value, he or she might drop the defensive behavior and slowly come to interact with you on eye level.


Always stick to facts. If necessary, keep a record in a small notebook, along with dates and the context.
Be a broken record. If the relative tries to twist facts, deny things said or done, or blame another, simply reiterate what you know to be the case and what behavior you prefer.
If needed, learn to be more assertive. Help can be found in such articles as How to be assertive and How to go from passive to assertive.

, If you are in the situation where this relative has made promises of any kind to you, treat them as empty words. Don't sit around waiting for a miracle; get on with doing whatever it is you intended to and find other people more dependable to give you any help needed.

If you spend a lot of time moving, resizing, maximizing, minimizing, restoring and generally switching windows then a tiling window manager might be for you. A TWM presents multiple windows on one screen aligned in a tile formation. The following is the manifesto of Ion, a dynamic tiling window manager with tabs for each frame.""So-called “modern desktop environments” converge on total unusability, and present-day mainstream graphical user interfaces in general are far less usable than they are praised to be.

"
Decide if you are worried about what others will think.,
Move beyond your need for outside approval.,
Kiss your fear of vulnerability good-bye.,
Acknowledge how you are reinforcing unrealistic ideals.Sometimes, there are conflicting or reinforcing societal ideals that can make it seem like a weakness to need help.,
Realize the detriment you are causing yourself and others.,
Don't be fooled by your own expertise.",How to Stop Thinking that Accepting Help is a Sign of Weakness1," There are many possible reasons that might be influencing your reluctance to seek help from others. One is your concern about how others view you. Some of the following reasons might be applicable to you:You may feel that you don't need help, or that any person offering help is threatening your independence. For example, maybe you have had to look out for yourself since an early age due to neglectful parents. Now, you believe suddenly accepting help from others makes you weak.
Perhaps, it was instilled in you that an adult or someone your age must take responsibility for himself. As a result, you believe it is socially wrong to ask (or to be a burden) to friends and family for assistance.
You may battle with fears of rejection or have a tendency to towards perfectionism. Both motivations can cause you to avoid accepting help for fear of failing or being seen as a failure.
If you're a business owner or professional, you may be worried that needing help can demonstrate a lack of professionalism. Consequently, you might feel that someone not handling his own affairs is inferior or incompetent.;
, Believing that others will judge you or reject you may be interfering with your ability to seek help when you need it. Learn to not internalize judgments or rejections inflicted on you by others. Fight approval-seeking with self-acceptance.


Become more accepting of yourself by recognizing your strengths and celebrating them.When you are aware of your positive characteristics, judgment or rejection from others impacts you less.
Write a list of your strongest traits and abilities. Reflect on this list when you are doubtful or your capabilities or when you are worried about gaining approval from others.

, Not wanting to show vulnerability can cause you to refrain from asking for help. When you think about it, the emotional exposure required to ask another for help can be quite uncomfortable. However, it is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, researchers declare that vulnerability is at the ""core"" of ""meaningful human experience"".Here's how to open yourself up to vulnerability:



Practice mindfulness as a first step towards embracing moments of vulnerability. Gradually take notice of the physical sensations, thoughts, and feelings that accompany vulnerability.
Give yourself love and acceptance. Acknowledge that being vulnerable is hard and takes courage. Applaud yourself for the slightest efforts.
Know that being open (and vulnerable) to others deepen the connection and intimacy you share. Choose wisely with whom you exercise vulnerability.

, If you understand that these ""ideals"" are but one among many approaches to living, you might be more likely to seek help when you need it. For example:


There is a common theme running through movies, books and even games, that a hero will gain the highest glory if he or she faces impossible problems and magically overcomes them on his or her own. Even historical events have been rewritten to accommodate this unrealistic view of the amazing prowess of leaders throughout time.The problem with this viewpoint is that most heroes and leaders have a lot of helpers and supporters unacknowledged in the wings. As such, comparing yourself with such unrealistic portrayals of heroes or leaders will only bring you unhappiness.
Some people have a tendency to think that you should be able to cope alone or to manage without help. Many of us see the world as it ""should be"" according to very unrealistic standards, as opposed to seeing the world as it actually ""is"". This isn't healthy thinking in the long-term. Quite often this ideal is reinforced by peer pressure or family views.

, By making yourself aloof from other human beings, you are building an invisible barrier around yourself that wards off the potential for new relationships and friendships.It can be deceptive to think that you can give help and advice but never need to accept it in return. This ultimately just leads to loneliness and despair as it only serves to isolate you from others.
Consider reciprocity, think about times you've helped others with your own specialties which can give you confidence in asking others for help or advice in their areas of expertise.

, Being trained in one field of expertise does not provide you with immunity from continuing to seek help from others within that same field or from other people in other fields. Your research, advice and practical skills will be all the better for asking for help from others, as well as gaining access to new methods and ideas."

Don't second-guess yourself.,
Accept that some people do act out of the kindness of their hearts.,
Be selective about who you ask for help.,
Understand the natural dynamic of give and take.,
Learn to trust others.,
Beware of undermining your problems.It can be all too easy to dismiss the worth or depth of your own problems.There is no hierarchy of problems, or scale of emotional pain.,
Let go of the problems that no one can fix.There lies the greatest strength of all as there is a big difference between ""burying"" problems in comparison to accepting, forgiving and letting them go.",How to Stop Thinking that Accepting Help is a Sign of Weakness2," It is possible to start finding pathways to letting others help you.One of the best ways of doing this is to follow your first mind. The minute you have a conscious thought that you are facing something you cannot alone handle, seek out help. Don't take the time to talk yourself out of it. Remember to make a note of the solution you receive for your problem. This will help you when you face a similar situation again


When the thought crosses your mind that you could do with help sorting out a problem - carrying a heavy box, making dinner, working out a work dilemma, etc. - act on it. Decide who you will ask, phrase the request in your head, and go and ask for help.

, If another person is being kind in offering help, accepting it at face value is the first step. Yes, there are people with bad intentions, but there are also those who want to do good by others. Look for those people in the world and stop focusing on the negative.


Seek out the goodness in others and restore your faith in humanity. An easy way to do this is by volunteering. Watching others give of themselves selflessly to assist those who are less fortunate is a terrific way to recognize the good in people. Volunteering also helps you to notice how people depend on one another within a community, and how all parts must work together to function as a whole., Choose wisely and carefully. Avoid people who make you feel like a lesser person in any way. Find people you really trust to try out asking for help first. This will allow you to open up bit by bit, and not be exposed to someone who might not do the right thing by you, or who might purposely make you feel weak for asking.

, In order to get, you need to give. If you keep cutting yourself off from opening up to others, you risk not sharing your skills, talents, and abilities with others in need of help. In helping another person, you cease to focus on yourself. And when you cease to focus on yourself, it is far easier to accept support back from another.


In giving of yourself (your time, your listening ear, your love, your care, etc.), you are helping another learn more about you, be able to care for you, and believe that you will reciprocate the attention that they bestow upon you.
Beyond receiving anything in return, giving also promotes cooperation, strengthens bonds, boosts feelings of gratitude, and is just downright good for your health., In order to receive help, you need to trust the other person and to trust that you're worthy of help (self-respect). This might be the hardest part but it is absolutely vital. Wholesome, accepting, self-assured trust is capable of absorbing rejection, attracting genuine help, and will easily detect the occasional exploitative person. Choosing to trust requires that you:


modify your expectations - remember that people are only human and they have both good and bad traits (so do you!)recognize that disappointment, fear, abandonment, and rejection are possible in all relationships
find yourself worthy and capable of making wise decisions and being around decent people, A problem is a problem, whatever its ease or difficulty. The litmus test is how much it is impacting you negatively and preventing you from moving forward. Belittling your problem as not worthy of being solved only serves to make it even more challenging to cope with.

, If you need help to do that, really don't be afraid to ask for it.

How Computers Work by Ron White

Upgrading and Repairing PCs by Scott Mueller;
, To become a computer genius, you will need to understand how the different parts of a computer work with one another.


Everything inside of your computer is connected to the motherboard, including the CPU, which acts as the computer’s “brain.”
RAM stores data that’s currently in use. Become familiar with how it works with and connects to the motherboard.
Peripheral cards add functions to the computer. Learn about sound, networking, and video cards.
Storage and disk drives are places to store data. Research hard drives, CD/DVD-ROM drives, and removable media like USB flash drives and SD cards.

, Each computer’s hardware specs should be visible on a label or sign near the unit. Notice the different amounts of RAM, different CPU brands and speeds, and different screen resolutions.


Try opening the same program on different computers and notice differences in speed.
Ask a salesperson which computers they recommend for various tasks. For example, “Which of these units is good for gaming?” or “Which would you recommend to someone who just needs to write papers for college?” Then, observe the difference in specs between the different computers.

, Watch other computer geniuses install RAM or replace dead hard drives to get a sense of what these tasks entail.Listen carefully as the person describes what they are doing.

, If you’re feeling confident, look inside your own computer to see how the different hardware components connect to one another.


If you feel apprehensive, ask someone who knows more about computers to walk you through the process.
Never open a computer unless the machine is on a sturdy surface and you are properly grounded.

Use every opportunity to play with operating systems other than the one you use.,
Explore the operating system you use on your own computer.,
Install new software.",How to Be a Computer Genius2," There are pros and cons to using Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Chrome OS, etc. Visit each operating system’s website to familiarize yourself with its features. Then, search the web for blogs that cater specifically to users of those operating systems. Reading user blogs is a great way to discover how people use their computers.


Windows is pre-installed on most PCs and is used by businesses as both servers and workstations. Windows is also popular with home users and gamers who love tinkering with hardware.
Mac OSX is known to be sleek and aesthetically pleasing. Made popular by artists, Mac OSX almost always runs on Apple hardware (although it can be installed on modern desktops) and has a familiar design that is gaining in popularity.
Linux a free (usually) flavor of “Unix” used by more advanced computer users. It’s highly customizable, secure, can be used on basically any type of hardware to perform any type of function.
Chrome OS is a simple operating system found on Google Chromebooks. It’s geared toward people who are more interested in using the web (and web applications) than anything else.

, To be a well-rounded computer genius, you should have experience using all operating systems and a wide variety of software.


You can find Windows PCs at public libraries. Most college campuses have both PCs and Macs available for student use. Alternatively, you can ask a friend or a relative if you can try using their computer.
Try doing the same sort of task (like browsing the web) on a Windows, Linux, or Mac computer and notice the differences.

, Both Macs and Windows have built-in System panels that provide details about the computer. Try to explore a new area of the Control Panel (Windows) or System Preferences (Mac) every day. Just poking around and clicking to view the different options will add necessary information to your budding genius brain.



To open the Control Panel in Windows, press ⊞ Win+S to launch the search, then type control panel. Click “Control Panel” in the search results, then browse through the various panels.
To view System Preferences on your Mac: Click the Apple menu at the top-left corner of the screen, then click “System Preferences.”

, If it’s your first time, start with something easy, like a new web browser. If you’re at a more advanced level, try installing Linux. Linux is a free operating system popular with the geeks (your team!) that can be installed on lots of different hardware configurations.Because Linux is so popular with people who love computers, there’s an entire community of Linux users active on chats and forums. Learning Linux is bound to make you new friends, perhaps even a mentor.

Fix your friends’ and family’s computers.,
Set up a test computer.",How to Be a Computer Genius4," When it comes down to it, the way you will be able to show off your genius computer skills is by solving problems. Troubleshooting is one of the most important skills to have in the IT industry.When you’re experiencing a computer issue, start by figuring out what exactly is going on.


Defining the problem as “The mouse doesn’t work” is too broad—narrow it down to the precise behavior or error message, such as “When I connect the mouse to the USB port, I see a message that says ‘This IRQ is assigned to the keyboard.”

, One of the most important skills a genius-in-the-making must learn is how to find information. There’s an art to getting accurate information about computer problems with Google.


Use quotes (“) around exact words and phrases (“this IRQ is assigned to the keyboard” instead of irq assigned to keyboard) to make sure your results match what you are looking for.Using Google to search a single site. If you’re looking for information about wireless networking and prefer your results be from Microsoft.com, type mouse problems site:microsoft.com instead of mouse problems microsoft.
Filter results by date (often relevant, as computers are always changing) by clicking “Search Tools” at the top of the search results, then change “Any time” to a different time range., While the manufacturer’s product pages may be among the first search results, some of the best troubleshooting information will come from user forums.


It will not take you long to figure out which sites return good search results and which should be avoided. If your search for information brings you to a page that seemingly has little to do with what you searched, that source will not be useful to you.

, Don’t be afraid to ask questions—but before you do, try using the forum’s “search” feature to reduce the possibility of duplicating an already-resolved thread.


Many online forums will not allow you to search their content until you register for an account.

, Now that you’ve been practicing your troubleshooting skills, find opportunities to get hands-on experience. Ask people you know if they are having trouble with their computers, and then offer to fix them. Use your new skills to find other people online who’ve experienced similar issues and try implementing suggested fixes.

, Computer geniuses learn how to troubleshoot by breaking things. Rather than messing with the computer you use every day, get yourself a test computer (or even better—a test lab with several types of computers) so you can really get your hands dirty.

It is sometimes preferable to instead of adapting your computer to be more private, reinstalling the OS, giving you a clean palette, wiping away all the junk that has accumulated.,
Add a password to your computer account.,
Password protect, and encrypt all your files in a manner similar to the above, and put more sensitive files in places you wouldn't expect.,
Know how to delete web history and cookies, and do so often.,
Understand that when you delete files, they aren't gone because their data remains, and is allotted to be written over.,
If you leave your computer for a second, lock it!,
If there are files that must be kept private no matter what (even if you are being tortured to hand them over), there are two programs called ""FreeOTFE"" and ""TrueCrypt"" that you can lock files in, and it is practically impossible to break the encryption.",How to Be Secretive About Your Computer,";
, A big mistake is to have a simple password, or one people can easily guess at. You should use a more cryptic password, a random hash of numbers and letters would be the best, but hard to memorize. Another good idea would be to write out a sentence for your password. ""Gordon ate a fat newt"" has no meaning to it, and would be impossible to guess. Do not leave a password hint, you should devote it to memory. If you leave a hint, make it cryptic, or make it seem to point to another password entirely.

, For things of that nature, removable storage is preferable. However, to keep it on the hard drive, put it in a folder called ""Projects"", in a sub folder in it called ""January 2008"", in that folder ""media"", than ""movies"" and then ""corrupted"" and then ""hot"". Remember to password protect all the files, and encrypt them.

Write a letter.,
Dive into the arts.",How to Avoid Using Electronic Devices," Leave your phone in the other room when you are doing your homework or cooking, or whatever you are busy with. Having the device at arms reach is just a distraction. You will get more work finished, more efficiently, if you remove that phone from the room entirely. As for your computer, you may need it while you are doing some of your work, but for many tasks, you don't really need it handy. So if you have a laptop, stow it elsewhere when you are busy. This way maybe you will stop running to it every time you think about checking in with your Tumblr contacts. If you have a desktop, pull yourself away and busy yourself in some other room of your house.;
, Go out of your house. Establish a daily walking routine or go to the gym. Play sports. Walk the dog. Take the kids to the park. Turn that phone off while you are out and about. Wait until after your daily exercise before you use electronics. This will increase the amount of time you are outside being healthy, and will decrease the period of the day when you are stuck to those screen devices of yours.

, Make a hard and fast rule that you will not pick up your phone or your computer until after lunchtime. This way you know you can attend to your email in the afternoon, after you have already addressed all your morning priorities. Those emails can wait a few hours, and you will get your important things done before you even see those. Many of the messages will just be distractions from your own goals, so make sure you get your own things done first, during your electronic-free morning.

, Do some of that housework you have been putting off! Or organize your office space. Remember that monster under the bed, or that junk pile in your desk drawer? Well get those gloves on and kill it! Now's a good time to do all that stuff you had promised yourself to do. Again, delay using your electronics until after you have done the dishes, or until after you have vacuumed the floor. Wait until your bathroom is thoroughly scrubbed before you open that laptop screen. Clean your home to the core! Handle every piece of mail. It's a great boredom killer and it'll distract you from that craving of your iPod.

, Read all kinds of books that interest you. Subscribe to a magazine. Take the paper. Make library visits a part of your weekly routine. Choose books on various topics and set aside an hour for reading each day. If you are still in school, make your teacher proud and start reading some classics. You'll find that the movie played in your mind is way better than Netflix!

, Go shopping or anything you like. Maybe join a club, and meet people with similar interests to you. Start a hobby. Play tennis, or start playing the bagpipes! There's more to the world than Flappy Bird! The more you get involved in real life activities, the less you are going to be having your nose stuck in that phone.

, Sometimes you are on Facebook, and you can't pull yourself away, because you are looking at yet another post, even though you are tired and need to get some sleep. And you are probably looking at a conversation between the second and third cousins of some acquaintance you hardly even ever knew way back in grade school. These are not important posts for you to read! X out the page. Close the computer. Go to bed. While you are at it, just log out of Facebook. This will make it a little more inconvenient to get back in to Facebook the next time you think about entering a time sucking site like that.

, Log out of, or uninstall, most applications you may have active on your phone. Pinterest? Flickr? Facebook? Candy Crush? No. You do not need to be roaming around people's boards and pages and playing daft games whenever you happen to have a free minute. Take one of those applications off your phone today. Remove another tomorrow and another the next. Pretty soon you will not have anything left on your phone except the essentials. Those games and apps which are not on your phone, cannot distract you from the important things in life.

, Do whatever you like. Make arrangements with friends at least a couple of days each week. See play. Go hear some live music at a coffee shop. Enjoy your life. Embrace not having texting thumbs, or headaches. Smile and enjoy what the world has to offer.

, Write to your mom. She will be so pleased to get a card or a letter from you!

, Learn to draw or paint. Learn about color, line, design. Learn tole painting, or knitting. Spend your time making something nice for your house, or for gifts for someone's birthday or an upcoming holiday.

Go for a landing.",How to Go to the Moon," Despite the all-in-one rocket ships popular in science fiction stories, going to the moon is a mission best broken into separate parts: achieving low-Earth orbit, transferring from Earth to lunar orbit, landing on the moon, and reversing the steps to return to Earth.


Some science fiction stories that depicted a more realistic approach to going to the moon had astronauts going to an orbiting space station where smaller rockets were docked that would take them to the moon and back to the station. Because the United States was in competition with the Soviet Union, this approach was not adopted; the space stations Skylab, Salyut, and the International Space Station were all put up after Project Apollo had ended.
The Apollo project used the three-stage Saturn V rocket. The bottom-most first stage lifted the assembly off the launching pad to a height of 42 miles (68 km), the second stage boosted it almost to low Earth orbit, and the third stage pushed it into orbit and then toward the moon.The Constellation project proposed by NASA for a return to the moon in 2018 consists of a two different two-stage rockets. There are two different first stage rocket designs: a crew-only lifting stage consisting of a single five-segment rocket booster, the Ares I, and a crew-and-cargo lifting stage consisting of five rocket engines beneath an external fuel tank supplemented by two five-segment solid rocket boosters, the Ares V. The second stage for both versions uses a single-liquid fuel engine. The heavy lifting assembly would carry the lunar orbital capsule and lander, which the astronauts would transfer to when the two rocket systems dock.;
, Because the moon has no atmosphere, you have to bring your own oxygen so you have something to breathe while you’re there, and when you stroll about on the lunar surface you need to be in a spacesuit to protect yourself from the blazing heat of the two-week-long lunar day or the mind-numbing cold of the equally long lunar night – not to mention the radiation and micro-meteoroids the lack of atmosphere exposes the surface to.You’ll also need to have something to eat. Most of the foods used by the astronauts in space missions have to be freeze-dried and concentrated to reduce their weight and then be reconstituted by adding water when eaten.They also need to be high-protein foods to minimize the amount of body waste generated after eating. (At least you can wash them down with Tang.)
Everything you take into space with you adds weight, which increases the amount of fuel necessary to lift it and the rocket carrying it into space, so you won’t be able to take too many personal effects into space – and those lunar rocks will weigh 6 times as much on Earth as they do on the moon.

, A launch window is the time range for launching the rocket from Earth to be able to land in the desired area of the moon during a time when there would be sufficient light for exploring the landing area. The launch window was actually defined two ways, as a monthly window and a daily window.


The monthly launch window takes advantage of where the planned landing area is with respect to the Earth and the sun. Because Earth’s gravity forces the moon to keep the same side facing Earth, exploration missions were chosen in areas of the Earth-facing side to make radio communication between Earth and the moon possible. The time also had to be chosen at a time when the sun was shining on the landing area.
The daily launch window takes advantage of launch conditions, such as the angle at which the spacecraft would be launched, the performance of booster rockets, and the presence of a ship downsite from the launch to track the rocket’s flight progress. Early on, light conditions for launching were important, as daylight made it easier to oversee aborts on the launch pad or before achieving orbit, as well as being able to document aborts with photographs. As NASA gained more practice in overseeing missions, daylight launches were less necessary; Apollo 17 was launched at night., Ideally, a rocket bound for the moon should be launched vertically to take advantage of Earth’s rotation in helping it achieve orbital velocity. However, in Project Apollo, NASA allowed for a possible range of 18 degrees either direction from vertical without significantly compromising the launch., In escaping the pull of Earth’s gravity, there are two velocities to consider: escape velocity and orbital velocity. Escape velocity is the velocity needed to escape a planet’s gravity completely, while orbital velocity is the velocity needed to go into orbit around a planet. Escape velocity for Earth’s surface is about 25,000 mph or 7 miles per second (40,248 km/hr or 11.2 km/s), while orbital velocity at the surface is .Orbital velocity for Earth’s surface is only around 18,000 mph (7.9 km/s); it takes less energy to achieve orbital velocity than escape velocity.


Furthermore, the values for orbital and escape velocity drop the further away from Earth’s surface you go, with escape velocity always about 1.414 (the square root of 2) times orbital velocity., After achieving low Earth orbit and verifying that all ship’s systems are functional, it’s then time to fire thrusters and go to the moon.


With Project Apollo, this was done by firing the third-stage thrusters one last time to propel the spacecraft toward the moon.Along the way, the command/service module (CSM) separated from the third stage, turned around, and docked with the lunar excursion module (LEM) carried in the upper part of the third stage.
With Project Constellation, the plan is to have the rocket carrying the crew and its command capsule dock in low Earth orbit with the departure stage and lunar lander brought up by the cargo rocket. The departure stage would then fire its thrusters and send the spacecraft to the moon.

, Once the spacecraft enters the gravity of the moon, fire the thrusters to slow it down and place it in orbit around the moon.

, Both Project Apollo and Project Constellation feature separate orbital and landing modules. The Apollo command module required that one of the three astronauts remain behind to pilot it, while the other two boarded the lunar module.Project Constellation’s orbital capsule is designed to be run automatically, so that all four of the astronauts it is designed to carry could board its lunar lander, if desired., Because the moon has no atmosphere, it is necessary to use rockets to slow the lunar lander’s descent to about 100 mph (160 km/hr) to ensure an intact landing and slower still to guarantee its passengers a soft landing.Ideally, the planned landing surface should be free of sizable boulders; this is why the Sea of Tranquility was chosen as the landing site for Apollo 11., Once you land on the moon, it’s time to take that one small step and explore the lunar surface. While there, you can gather lunar rocks and dust for analysis on Earth, and if you brought along a collapsible lunar rover as the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions did, you can even hot-rod on the lunar surface at up to 11.2 mph (18 km/hr).(Don’t bother to rev the engine, though; the unit is battery powered, and there’s no air to carry the sound of a revving engine, anyway.)

, After you’ve done your business on the moon, pack up your samples and tools and board your lunar lander for the return trip.


The Apollo lunar module was designed in two stages: a descent stage to get it down to the moon and an ascent stage to lift the astronauts back into lunar orbit. The descent stage was left behind on the moon (and so also was the lunar rover)., The Apollo command module and the Constellation orbital capsule are both designed to take astronauts from the moon back to Earth. The contents of the lunar landers are transferred to the orbiters, and the lunar landers are then un-docked, to eventually crash back to the moon., The main thruster on the Apollo and Constellation service modules is fired to escape the moon’s gravity, and the spacecraft is directed back to Earth. On entering Earth’s gravity, the service module thruster is pointed toward Earth and fired again to slow the command capsule down before being jettisoned.

, The command module/capsule’s heat shield is exposed to protect the astronauts from the heat of re-entry. As the vessel enters the thicker part of Earth’s atmosphere, parachutes are deployed to slow the capsule further.


For Project Apollo, the command module splashed down in the ocean, as previous manned NASA missions had done, and was recovered by a Navy vessel. The command modules were not re-used.For Project Constellation, the plan is to touch down on land, as Soviet manned space missions did, with splashdown in the ocean an option if touchdown on land is not possible. The command capsule is designed to be refurbished, replacing its heat shield with a new one, and reused."

Know where Orion is.,
Memorize the ""corner"" stars in Orion.,
Time to start navigating!,
Continue following Saiph and Bellatrix and you will encounter Perseus, the hero from Greek mythology.,
Follow Rigel and Betelgeuse, the two brightest stars in Orion, up to enter Gemini and view its two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux.,
Tracing from Bellatrix to Betelgeuse leads to Canis Minor, shining with the bright stars Procyon and Gomeisa.,
Draw an imaginary line from Rigel to Bellatrix and you will crash into Capella, the brightest star in the constellation Auriga.,
After you have found these stars, use them to find more constellations.",How to Use Orion to Find Other Constellations," If you have no clue where it is, use star charts, such as David Levy's 'A Guide to Sky watching'. Google Sky Map is also an excellent resource for the novice.


Note that Orion is not visible around June. It is visible in the morning from July to mid-December, all night in late December, and in the evening from January to May.;
, Betelgeuse is in the top left, and glows reddish orange. It also fluctuates in brightness over the course of several years. To its right, Bellatrix (The Amazon Star) is a pale blue. Below Bellatrix is Rigel, a blue super-giant star, and the brightest in Orion. The dimmest star is Saiph, to the left of Rigel and below Betelgeuse. Between all of these stars is Orion's Belt, the three bright stars in a row.


Underneath Orion's Belt is his sword, which contains the Orion Nebula. This is a good target for binoculars or a small telescope.

, Start with the two dimmest corner stars, Bellatrix and Saiph. Follow them up to encounter Aldebaran, the brightest star in Taurus, and the Pleiades, a bright star cluster. Follow them down to reach Beta Canis Majoris and Adhara. To the left of these stars is the sky's brightest star, Sirius. (The sun is actually the brightest.)


For this one, you can also follow Orion's belt right and left, respectively.

, In Perseus is Algol, one of a class of eclipsing variable stars, and the ""Old Faithful"" of the winter sky. Every 2.8 days its larger, dimmer companion obscures the brighter companion, leading to a sudden dimming that lasts for a few hours.

, (Fun fact: Pollux is the brightest star with a confirmed planet. Don't try to use a telescope to look for it though, it's not visible.) Castor is a sextuple star system, but only 3 can be seen in a telescope. One of these stars, YY Geminorium, is a variable.

, Procyon has a white dwarf companion, Procyon B, which can be seen in a large telescope. Going backwards leads to Aries, the Ram. Just under it is the dim constellation of Cetus. Omicron Ceti, known as Mira, is a long-period red giant variable. It changes from magnitude 8 (invisible) to magnitude 2 (one of the brightest stars in the sky) over 11 months.

, Auriga rides Taurus, the Bull. Capella is the highest first-magnitude star, and is visible year-round from the northern US.

, A good set of star charts or Google Sky Map will help you out here.

Look up a chart of the International Space Station's appearances in your area.,
Find several times when the space station is visible for a few minutes.,
Use the chart to narrow these times down to the brightest appearances.,
Look up the weather forecast.,
Find the position of the space station on a satellite chart.,
Know how high to look.,
Look for the space station at this position.,
Use binoculars only if necessary.",How to View the International Space Station," You can follow one of the links listed below, or search for ""international space station satellite chart"" online. These charts contain several useful pieces of information that will help you figure out when a viewing is possible. Choose a website that allows you to enter your address, city name, or zip code; if you enter inaccurate information, the information listed may be incorrect.


Try the charts at Heavens Above, NASA, or SpaceWeather.
Some sites may attempt to automatically detect your location based on your internet service provider's nearest server. This is not always accurate, so check for a name of the city or location used, and switch to a different site if inaccurate.
Some websites may abbreviate the International Space Station as ""ISS"".;
, Sometimes, from your location, the ISS will only take a few seconds to cross the visible portion of the sky. Other times, it will take two minutes or more. Look for appearances that last as long as possible to give yourself the best chance of viewing the station. Write down several of these appearance.


Appearances at night, within a few hours of sunset or sunrise, will be easiest to see. More information on brightness is provided in the next step to help you find out whether the station will be visible during the day.
Some charts will list the length of the appearance in its own column, while on others you may need to calculate the appearance length yourself by subtracting the start time from the end time. These times are usually written as three numbers, in hour:minute:second format. Check whether the site uses a 24 hour clock or the a.m./p.m. system.

, Most charts should list the space station's ""brightness"" or ""magnitude;"" find another one if yours does not include this information. The brightness scale is a little odd: a negative number, such as -4, is actually brighter than a positive number, such as +3! Here are some guidelines to help you understand what brightness ratings may be viewable:A magnitude of -4 to -2 is the brightest the space station typically gets, and may even be visible during the day.
-2 to +4 is usually visible at night, but you may have difficulty seeing it if there are bright city lights in your area.
+4 to +6 is dim, approaching the limits of the human eye. If the night sky is clear and there are few ground lights in your area, you might just be able to see the station. Binoculars are recommended.
To get a rough idea of how bright the station will be, compare it to these approximate magnitudes : the sun during the day has a magnitude of about -26.7; the moon has magnitude -12.5; and Venus, one of the remaining brightest objects in the sky, has magnitude -4.4.

, Once you've picked a time when the station will be bright and visible for a relatively long period, look up the weather forecast for that day. Try to find an hour-by-hour weather forecast if possible, to see whether there will be cloud cover blocking your view during this time. Weather forecasts are often inaccurate more than a day in advance, so check again 24 hours before the station is due to appear to get an up-to-date prediction.

, Refer to the space station appearances chart you found in the last section. It should have a column labeled with one of the following: ""where to look,"" ""appears,"" ""azimuth,"" or ""Az."" Look at the contents of this column to find out the general area of the sky the space station will appear in:


Look N(orth), E(ast), S(outh), or W(est) according to the letter or word listed in that column. The chart may give you a more specific instruction between one of these four directions. For instance, NW (northwest) means halfway between North and West. NNW (north-northwest) means halfway between North and Northwest.

Read about using a compass if you are not sure how to find a direction.

, The same chart should have a column labeled ""altitude,"" with numbers listed below as ""degrees"" (or the degree symbol, º). Astronomers divide the sky into many segments called degrees, so they can refer to a specific position in the sky. A position of 0º is at the horizon, 90º is directly above your head, and 45º is exactly in between 0º and 90º. To find rough positions in between these numbers, extend your arm fully in front of you and close your hand into a fist. The distance from the horizon to the top of your first is roughly 10º. If you are looking for 20º, for example, place your fist just above the horizon, then place your other fist on top of the first. The point above your second fist is about 20º. Keep alternating fists to find positions at higher degrees.It may seem strange that the space station suddenly ""appears"" in the middle of the sky, instead of coming around the horizon. This can happen because the space station is only visible when light from the sun is reflecting off it. When the space station moves out of the earth's shadow, it suddenly becomes visible. It may also not be visible near sunrise or sunset until it has moved high enough in the sky to escape the bright background of the sun's glow.

, At the time specified on the star chart, look for the space station at the direction and height you found in the earlier steps. The space station usually looks like a moving dot or small, white or yellowish sphere. It does not blink or flash repeatedly, but if you're lucky, it might flare brighter for a moment as sunlight glints on an especially reflective surface.


It will not have multi-colored lights.
There will not be a contrail.

, Binoculars make it easier to see fainter objects. A 50mm binocular typically lets you see brightness up to +10 on the magnitude scale described in the previous section.However, it may be hard to find the space station with binoculars alone, since you can only see a small part of the sky through them. It's best to find the station with your naked eye, then lift binoculars to your eyes without looking away from the station.


A telescope allows you to see even fainter objects, but it can be almost impossible to find the space station unless you have a way to precisely measure where the telescope is pointing. Use a similar strategy as described for binoculars, but pick a time when the station will be visible for several minutes if you are not experienced at using your telescope.

Narrow your view to just the stars you can see when facing south. This southern sky is where you will find the sea goat, Capricornus., The direction of the Capricornus also changes if you live in the southern hemisphere. In this case, you would look to the northern sky, not the southern sky. Again, it helps to ignore the rest of the sky if you are looking for just one constellation., The sea is in the southern portion of the sky (northern from the southern hemisphere). It is home to several water-related constellations, such as Aquarius, Pisces, and Cetus. Knowing this area and these constellations can help you find Capricornus.If you are familiar with the Summer Triangle constellation, you can draw a straight line from one of it’s points (the star Vega), through a second point (the star Altair) and straight to Capricornus.

, The horns of the sea goat are found above (below in the southern hemisphere) one of the points of the triangle. These “horns” are a cluster of stars that appear to make two points. This gives the appearance that the sea goat has a head and horns just like a normal goat., Knowing the main stars in any constellation can help you find it. You can look these stars up on the internet, or ask an experienced astronomer. Some of the main stars in Capricornus are:Alpha Capricorn (two different stars)

Find a star chart or app.,
Get graph paper or a tracking sheet.",How to Track Jupiter's Moons1," If you don’t already have a telescope, even a common, small 60 mm refractor will allow you to see Jupiter’s cloud bands and moons. You can find this type of beginner telescope for between 50 and 100 US dollars, depending on quality.More powerful telescopes that are still great for beginners can cost upwards of 300 to 400 US dollars, but provide better imaging. Some even interface with a tablet or smartphone, allowing you to easily track the sky using your mobile device.;
, If you don’t have a telescope but do own a good pair of binoculars, you can use them to see Jupiter’s moons. You’ll need a pair with a minimum of 7x magnification, or seven times more powerful than human vision. While they’ll only be visible as tiny dots, you should be able to make out the moons clearly.A good pair of modern binoculars is about as powerful as the telescope Galileo used when he first discovered Jupiter’s four large moons, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.  

, You can find a star chart or almanac online that will give you the locations of stars and planets on a given night. Even easier, you can download a mobile app that automatically locates a specific celestial body.SkySafari and Google Sky Map both allow you to search for your stellar object and help you locate it in your patch of sky.
JupiterMoons for iOS lets you find Jupiter’s location in the sky and current appearance., You’ll need lined graphing paper in order to track moons’ transits over the course of several nights. A pencil will also come in handy, and if you’d like, you can use four different colored pencils to distinguish the moons when you graph them.


You can also download a moon tracking activity sheet online."
"
Set aside the same observation time for at least a week.,
Find Jupiter in the sky.,
Aim your telescope at Jupiter.",How to Track Jupiter's Moons2," To track Jupiter and its moons, you’ll need to observe at the same time (within a 30 minute window) every day for seven to nine days. Sticking to the same observation time will ensure the accuracy of your results. Make sure you have time to set aside to make your observations, and hopefully the weather will cooperate with your experiment.Unless you live in a dense urban environment, you will most likely be able to observe Jupiter without having to go to a dark, isolated location. Your backyard should work just fine!
While tracking the moons over the course of nine days is best, you can also make several observations over the course of six hours to track minor changes in their orbits and Jupiter’s shifting position in the night sky.

, Use your sky chart or mobile app to find out when Jupiter will be observable. While it’s visible to the naked eye, you’ll have to make sure it’s observable at your location.For example, if Jupiter appears near the western horizon in the evening, it’s too close to the setting sun to be observable.
You can easily find out online when Jupiter will be visible for a given year: http://www.nakedeyeplanets.com/visibility.htm


, Once you’ve found Jupiter with your chart or app and have spotted it with your naked eye, you’ll need to point your telescope on it. Focus on the planet and center it in the eyepiece. You should be able to see from one to four moons, all of which should be in a straight line.Some of the moons may be behind Jupiter or so close to each other that they appear to be one object.

"
"
Graph the moons.,
Repeat this observation for at least a week.,
Connect the observations with a line.",How to Track Jupiter's Moons3," On a piece of graph paper, draw a vertical line to represent the position of Jupiter. Make a large dot representing Jupiter on the vertical line you drew, then skip several lines down and make another large dot. Proceed to make Jupiter dots for as many days as you’ll be making observations, and label each area with a date or day of the week.


Once you’ve drawn your Jupiter dots, go to the first one and plot the moons relative to the vertical line. For example, graph the moon that’s closest to Jupiter one line to the left or right of the Jupiter dot, depending on what you observe. Graph the next closest moon two lines away from the dot.
You can number the moons by brightness, or if you’d like, you can cross check them with your Jupiter mobile app and color code them using colored pencils.

, While seven to nine days will give you usable data, making observations for a month more will increase the accuracy of your measurements. Each dot you drew will help you make your graph for that day, so on the second day of your observations, plot the moons relative to the second Jupiter dot.


Be sure to continue to use your labeling or color coding system to keep track of each moon.
If you cannot observe on a certain day, skip the graph for that day.

, Draw a line to connect each moon’s daily positions. When you do this correctly, you trace out a wave pattern, called a sine wave. Now you have a graph of the moon's positions over time. You can even use this pattern to predict the moons' positions over several years!"

Check if the object twinkles.,
Note whether the object rises and sets.,
Identify the ecliptic.,

Avoid other limiting factors.",How to Tell the Difference Between Planets and Stars," One of the easiest ways to distinguish between stars and planets in the night sky is by looking to see if the object twinkles or shimmers. This can usually be detected with the naked eye if you have a clear view of the sky and if you watch the sky for long enough.Stars twinkle and shimmer - hence, the song ""Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star.""
Planets do not twinkle. They remain constant in their brightness and their overall appearance in the night sky.
If viewed through a telescope, planets may appear to ""wiggle"" along the edges.Any object that blinks, twinkles, or shimmers is most likely a star. However, it could also be an aircraft if it is moving quickly across the night sky.;
, Celestial objects are not fixed in the night sky. All celestial bodies move, but how those bodies move can be a good indication of whether they're stars or planets.Planets rise in the East and set in the West. They tend to follow a similar celestial path across our sky as the sun and moon.
Stars move around in the night sky, but they do not rise or set. Instead, they orbit in a circular pattern around Polaris (the North Star).
If the celestial object you see appears to move in a more-or-less straight line across the night sky, it is most likely a planet.
Satellites also move across the night sky, but they do so much more quickly than planets. A planet may take hours or even weeks to cross the night sky, whereas a satellite can cross overhead in a matter of minutes.

, Planets are always found along an imaginary belt across the night sky called the ecliptic. This belt is not actually a visible object, but careful observation will help you find the location where celestial objects are congregated. While stars may also appear along this invisible belt, they should be distinguishable by their shimmering appearance.Of the celestial bodies along the ecliptic, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn are significantly brighter than the surrounding stars. This is due to their proximity to the sun since their ""brightness"" is just reflected sunlight.
The easiest way to find the ecliptic is to note the location and trajectory of the sun and moon in the sky relative to your location on the Earth. The sun's path across our sky is very close to the path of planets along the ecliptic., Not all planets are colorful. However, many of the most prominent planets in our night sky appear to have some type of coloration. This can help differentiate the planets from stars. While some people with exceptionally good vision may be able to detect subtle coloration, that coloration usually falls within the blueish white to yellowish white range.For most people, stars appear white to the naked eye.Mercury is typically gray or somewhat brownish in color.Venus appears pale yellow.
Mars usually appears somewhere between pale pink and bright red. This is affected by the relative brightness or dimness of Mars, which changes on a two-year cycle.Jupiter appears orange with white bands.
Saturn typically appears pale gold in color.
Uranus and Neptune appear pale blue. However, they are not usually visible to the naked eye.

, While planets and stars both light up the night sky, planets typically appear much brighter than many stars.Astronomers measure the relative brightness of celestial objects using the astronomical magnitude scale, with most of the planets falling in the range of objects that are easily visible to the naked eye.Planets reflect the bright light of our solar system's sun, which is relatively close to the earth. Stars, by contrast, emit their own light.
While some stars may be much brighter and larger than our sun, these stars are much farther from earth than the planets in our solar system. Because of this, the planets (which reflect our sun's light) typically appear brighter from earth.

, Whether you have poor night vision or are simply confused about the location of certain celestial bodies, a chart or guide can help you determine where to look. You can purchase star charts and planetary guides from a bookstore, print out free guides from the internet, or download a star/planetary guide app on your smartphone.Remember that star charts are usually only valid for a limited period of time (typically about one month). That's because the position of stars in the sky changes over time as the earth continues along its orbit.
If you consult a star chart or planetary guide out in the field, make sure you use a dim red flashlight. These flashlights are designed to provide light without affecting your eyes' ability to adjust to the darkness.

, If stargazing with the naked eye isn't getting you enough celestial body views, you may want to consider using a telescope or binoculars. These instruments can help assist your view by magnifying the area you look at. This can make visible objects clearer and can even bring objects invisible to the naked eye into your view.Some experts recommend getting familiar with celestial bodies using the naked eye, then trying binoculars, and finally moving up to using a telescope. This can help you get more acclimated to the visible bodies and their place in the night sky.
Compare telescopes and binoculars online before you invest in one. Read the reviews written by people who have owned a given model by searching online for the model you're interested in.

, Light pollution from urban areas can drastically limit your ability to see celestial bodies in the night sky. To really maximize visibility, you may want to consider visiting a dark-sky site.These designated sites have been identified by the International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) as places worth protecting against encroaching light pollution and urban development.Common dark-sky sites include state and national parks, though other dark-sky sites are surrounded by well-lit, well-developed regions.
Check the IDA website to find a dark-sky site near you.

, An occultation is when the moon passes between the Earth and a given star or planet, obstructing that celestial body's visibility. These obstructions happen somewhat regularly and can easily be planned around since their occurrence is predictable.Occultations may be visible from some locations on Earth and not from others. Check in advance to see whether an occultation is scheduled and whether your visibility will be significantly affected.
You can find out about planned occultations by searching online or by consulting an astronomy guide. The international Occultation Timing Association publishes their predictions online for free., Light reflected off the moon can inhibit your ability to see stars and planets. If it is close to a full moon, you may have a hard time observing celestial bodies. For this reason, it's best to check on the current phase of the moon before venturing out to observe the night sky.If you aren't sure about the moon's current phase, you can consult an online guide to the moon's phases for free. The U.S. Navy's website allows you to check moon phases by date as far in advance as the year 2100., Knowing how to distinguish between stars and planets will only get you so far if the night sky is not very visible. Your ability to see celestial bodies can be limited by a number of factors, both man-made and naturally-occurring.Light pollution is one of the biggest limiting factors of night sky visibility. If you live in or near a metropolitan area, you will probably need to travel to a more rural area to increase visibility.
Cloud cover and significant snow cover can both affect night sky visibility. If it's very cloudy or if the ground is significantly covered in snow, you may have a hard time seeing celestial bodies in the sky.

, There are many other factors can also affect night sky visibility, including some that you might be inflicting upon yourself. For example, your level of alcohol consumption, your nicotine consumption, and your pupil dilation at the time of viewing can all affect your ability to see celestial bodies. These factors all affect your eyes' ability to adjust to the dark and identify stars and planets in the night sky."

Figure out where you want to go.",How to Spot the North Star," Ursa Major is a constellation that is also called ""Big Bear,"" ""the Big Dipper,"" or ""Plough"". The two outermost stars in the cup of the ""dipper"" (or the ""blade"" of the plough) are called the ""pointers"" because they describe a straight line that points to the North Star (see figure).;
, The Big Dipper is comprised of seven stars that are very recognizable in the night sky.The seven stars compose a shape that looks like a cup with a handle.


To make it easier to find Ursa Major, try using a constellation map if one is available. You can also download a constellation finding app on your devices (like SkyViewfor Apple devices or SkyMapfor Androids).
Also try looking on a clear night. The absence of clouds will make it easier to spot the star groupings.

, Ursa Major rotates in the sky, so its position depends on the time of your at which you are viewing it. It always rotates around the North Star.So, sometimes the cup is facing up, while other times the cup faces down or to the side.


Remember that the Big Dipper is a fixture of the Northern Hemisphere’s sky. So you will only be able to see it and follow these guidelines if you are in the Northern Hemisphere.
Here are some seasonal guidelines for finding the Big Dipper based on its location at midnight:

In the spring, the Big Dipper is located to the north of the North Star (Polaris) with the cup facing downward.
In the summer, the Big Dipper is located just west of Polaris with the cup facing to the right.
In the fall, the Big Dipper is situated to the south of Polaris with the cup facing upright.
In the winter, the Big Dipper can be found to the east of Polaris with the cup facing towards the left.



, Latitude is the position north or south of the equator. The height of the North Star above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the observer. It cannot be seen by an observer on or below the Equator although, as a practical matter, it will be too close to the horizon to be observed south of 10 degrees of North Latitude.


For reference, here are some latitudinal measurements of some major locations in the Northern Hemisphere:

The North Pole has a latitude of 90 degrees north.Reykjavik, Iceland has a latitude of 70 degrees north.
Juneau, Alaska and Edinburgh, Scotland have a latitude of 60 degrees north.
Seattle, Washington, New York City, and Venice, Italy have a latitude of 50 degrees north.
Denver, Colorado and Seoul, South Korea have a latitude of 40 degrees north.
New Orleans, Louisiana and Orlando, Florida have a latitude of 30 degrees north.
Mexico City, Mexico and Kingston, Jamaica have a latitude of 20 degrees north.
San Jose, Costa Rica and Panama City, Panama have a latitude of 10 degrees north.


If you have access to the internet, you can use a latitude finder online to determine your latitude, like the one offered by NASA.If you don’t know your latitude and you don’t have access to the internet, you can determine your latitude by looking at the sun at noon.Put one flat board or stick in the ground pointing upwards so that it is perfectly perpendicular with the ground.
Use another flat board on the top (making a T with the two boards), but tilt the top board toward the sun. The angle of the shadow cast by the sun will be the degree of your latitude.
Note that these readings are only accurate on March 21st and September 21st (the spring and fall equinoxes). In the winter (specifically December 21st) you should subtract 23.45 degrees from your reading and in the summer (specifically June 21st) you should add 23.45 degrees. These variations in measurement exist because of the way the Earth is tilted when it orbits the sun.


If you know your location in terms of degrees of latitude, face north and look for a moderately bright star that many degrees above the horizon. A fist held out at arm's length represents approximately 10 degrees in the sky and can be used to measure the height above the horizon., The two outer most stars in the “cup” of the Big Dipper (the two farthest from the “handle”) are the keys to finding the North Star.


Draw an imaginary line straight through these two stars toward the Little Dipper. This will lead you to the handle of the Little Dipper. The brightest star at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper is the North Star.The North Star (Polaris, or sometimes Dhruva Tara (fixed star), Taivaanneula (Heaven's Needle), or Lodestar) is a Second Magnitude multiple star about 430 light years from Earth. Because it is very close to the North Celestial Pole, it appears stationary over the Northern Horizon., The constellation of Cassiopeia, which looks like a big ""W,"" is always opposite Ursa Major. The North Star is located approximately midway between the central star of Cassiopeia and Ursa Major.This trick is especially helpful in the Fall when it is harder to see the Big Dipper., The North Star is more reliable than a compass, which can be affected by environmental factors and periodic variations. If you can find north by locating the North Star and your compass tells you something different, follow the direction the North Star leads you., Where the North Star appears in the sky depends on your latitude. At the North Pole, the North Star appears directly overhead, but at the equator, it would appear on the horizon – both corresponding to the latitudes of the location.If you use the “fist” method and count how many “fists” the North Star appears over the horizon, that will give you your latitude. Remember that a “fist” counts as approximately 10 degrees for latitude.

, Use the North Star to guide you in a direction, or at the very least, to keep you from going in circles if you are lost. Think about where you are and which direction would be the most helpful, especially if you are lost in the wilderness and need to get back to civilization.


Once you have found the North Star, facing it will point you due north. If you face directly away from it, you’ll be facing due south.When you are facing the North Star, stretch your arms out to your sides. Your left hand will be pointing due west and your right hand will be pointing due east."

Make a Jupiter Movie.",How to Observe Jupiter," Before you start looking for Jupiter, you should get hold of a sky map which can show you where in the sky to start looking. For more advanced astronomers, there are numerous sophisticated maps of the sky which show the position and trajectory of the planets. For those inexperienced in reading these paper maps there are a number of smart phone apps which you can download which will help you to find Jupiter and the other planets and stars in the sky.


With some smartphone apps all that you have to do is hold the phone up to the sky and it will identify the stars and planets for you.;
, Jupiter is so massive and bright in the sky that it can be viewed with a good pair of binoculars. Binoculars that magnify seven times human eyesight will be effective and will reveal Jupiter as a small white disk in the sky. If you don’t know what strength your binoculars are look at numbers on the side, if it says 7x another number then they magnify seven times and will enable to observe Jupiter.

, To really get a good view of the Jupiter’s spectacular features, your observations will be improved with even an entry-level telescope. This equipment will help you to see Jupiter’s famous belts, all four of its moons, and potentially even the Great Red Spot. The range of telescopes available is huge, but for beginners a 60 or 70mm refractor telescope is a good place to start.The performance of your telescope will drop if the optics are not sufficiently cooled. Keep it in a relatively cool place, and before you want to start viewing place it outside so its temperature can drop before you begin., You can save time and avoid fruitless hours by learning to identify good viewing conditions quickly. Before setting up the telescope take a look at the stars. Ask yourself if the stars are twinkling brightly through the sky. If so, this suggests that there is a turbulent atmosphere. Such conditions make planet observation more difficult, instead you want calm night-sky. In a steady night with good seeing conditions, the sky might appear somewhat hazy. The Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO) has a scale for seeing conditions which goes from 0 to 10. If the conditions score lower than a 5, your chances of a good observation are very slim., The best time to observe planets is at night, but Jupiter is so bright that it can sometimes be seen shortly after dusk, and shortly before dawn. At dusk it will rise in the east, but as night goes on Jupiter will appear to travel westwards through the sky. At mid-northern latitudes it will set in the west a little before the sun rises in the east each morning., Be sure to set yourself up in a good place where it is dark and quiet so you can concentrate on your planet gazing. Your backyard is perfect, but remember that observing planets can be a slow and engrossing business, so be sure to wrap up warm and be prepared for a lengthy wait. If you are planning on documenting your observation have any materials with you so you don’t have to leave your observation post.

, Find a comfortable and steady position and if possible mount your binoculars on a camera tripod, or something else steady and fixed so they won’t shake as you use them. With the binoculars you should be able to see Jupiter as a white disk.


You may also be able to see up to four distinct specs of light near Jupiter, these are its four Galilean moons. Jupiter has at least 63 moons in orbit. In 1610, Galileo named the four main moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. How many you can see will depend on their position orbiting Jupiter.
Even if you have a telescope, it can be helpful to use binoculars to spot Jupiter in the sky before moving on to the telescope for a more detailed observation.

, Once you have spotted Jupiter, you can begin a more detailed observation of the planet’s surface through your telescope and identify some of its key features. Jupiter is famous for its darker cloud belts and lighter zones which are appear laterally across the planet’s surface. Try to identify the central light area known as the equatorial zone and the darker equatorial belts north and south of it.When searching for the belts, keep trying. It takes time to learn how to spot the belts through a telescope. It's a good idea to try this with someone who is already familiar with spotting them.

, One of Jupiter’s most fascinating features is its Great Red Spot. This giant oval storm, larger than Earth, has been observed on Jupiter for more than 300 hundred years. You can locate it at the outer edge of the south equatorial belt. The spot shows clearly how fast surface of the planet is changing; within the space of only an hour, you should be able to see the spot clearly move across the planet.


The intensity of the Great Red Spot varies, and it can’t always be seen.
It isn’t really that red, but more of orange or a pale pink colour.

, Once you have a good view of Jupiter you can document your astronomical observations by drawing Jupiter and recording its appearance. This is essentially a less high-tech version of what astronomy is all about, observing, documenting and analysing what you see in the sky. Jupiter is ever-changing so try to sketch it in around twenty minutes. You’ll be following in a great tradition of astronomical drawing., If you prefer a more technologically advanced method of recording your observations you could try photographing Jupiter. Much like telescopes, the camera you use can be very powerful or more basic and still get results. Some star-gazers use charged coupled device cameras or even cheap and lightweight webcams for photographing planets with telescopes.If you want to try using a DSLR camera, remember longer exposures will capture the moons more clearly but will wash out the dark and light bands across the planet surface., One great way to track the constant change on the surface of Jupiter and the position of its moons is to film it. You can do this in much the same way as you would photograph it.


Use your notes to compare different observations to keep track of changes on the surface of the planet and to find things of interest.
The clouds are turbulent and the planet's appearance can change dramatically in just a few days.

Use a telescope.",How to Observe Mercury," Mercury is the closest planet to the sun, which means that it is often in the sun’s glare and hardly seen. However, there are specific times and seasons where the orbits of the earth and mercury place Mercury high above the horizon line. What months and at what times of the day Mercury is visible is entirely dependent on your location on earth, but most calendars will divide viewing months and times into hemispheres.Mercury is best observed in the Northern Hemisphere during the evening in April and May, and during the morning in October and November.Look up astronomical calendars online or go to your local bookstore and purchase a book on astronomy.Try using sites, like the Society for Popular Astronomy, or books, like Stargazing for Beginners.;
, Sky charts and star maps will help you plot and visualize the elongation points of Mercury’s orbit. Sky charts and maps can also indicate where on the horizon line you should begin looking for Mercury, how long Mercury will be visible, and how bright it will be at various points in its orbit.Mercury.


Research sky charts and star maps online, or go to your local bookstore to check for an astronomy section.
Try using apps like Star Chart on your smartphone.

, Attempting to observe Mercury during the day can be dangerous as Mercury is the closest planet to the sun in our solar system. Not only will Mercury be very difficult to observe during the day, you may risk serious and permanent damage to you eye.


Mercury is best observed after periods of twilight have ended.

, Mercury can generally be observed with a naked eye as it has the sun as a bright backdrop. Mercury is best observed with the naked eye during times right before and after the sun has set, which gives enough light pollution to contrast the shadow of Mercury. A general time to try and view Mercury with your naked eye is 90 minutes before sunrise or after sunset.If you find that the sky is still too bright to view with your naked eye, or not bright enough in the early morning, wait ten minutes and try again., Binoculars will help you observe Mercury as light begins to fade into twilight. The more the sun fades the less defined Mercury will become. Try having a pair of binoculars on hand while you are observing Mercury with your naked eye so that you can transition once your eyes begin to strain.There are many online references, like Sky and Telescope, that provide detailed suggestions for binoculars geared toward specific planets are stars you want to view., Using a telescope will allow you for a closer and more detailed view of Mercury when observable. However, a telescope will also prolong the amount of time you will be able to observe Mercury as it becomes gradually more difficult to observe during its crescent phases.To see the surface of Mercury you will need to magnify your telescope to 200x - 250x.Look online or at local cultural centers to find a stargazing club or group that owns a telescope.
Check to see if there is an Observatory close to you.

If the moon is not visible, (by this if it is below the horizon), but Orion is, the cluster is probably east of Orion.,
Make sure all nearby light sources are off.,
Look directly at between Orion and the moon.,
If you wear glasses for distance vision correction, put them on.

Squint if you have to, but you should eventually be able to see a faint blue light, not a single star, in the sky.,Try using a telescope or some binoculars for a better view.,
Congrats.",How to Spot the Pleiades Cluster," The cluster itself is actually very bright, but is far away from Earth, and therefore, difficult to spot with the naked eye. First thing, know where to look in the sky. The cluster is generally somewhere between the moon and the Orion constellation. Locate the moon, (shouldn't be too hard), and then locate Orion.;
, If the moon is visible but Orion is not, look to the west of the moon.

, If there is any light pollution at all then the cluster will be extremely difficult to find.

, You should be looking high into the sky.

,, If you look closer, you can even make out the individual stars, an may even notice the dipper shaped pattern they make.

,, You have just spotted the Pleiades star cluster.

Give a star a proper name according to its mythological significance.,
Give a star a proper name according to its position in the sky or constellation.,
Give a star a proper name for its astronomical properties.,
Give a star a proper name for other reasons.",How to Name a Star1," Just as many constellations are associated with myths or legends, the stars within them were given their names for the myths they were associated with.


The constellation Gemini represents the twin sons of Queen Leda of Sparta who could not be separated by the death of 1 of them. The names of the 2 brightest stars in that constellation, Castor and Pollux, were the twins' names.
The 7 brightest stars of the Pleiades represented and are named for the 7 daughters of Atlas and Pleione pursued by Orion: Alcyone, Celaeno, Electra, Maia, Merope, Sterope, and Taygeta.
The proper name of the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major, Sirius, means ""searing"" or ""scorching."" This name derives from the ancient Egyptians' belief that when Sirius rose with the sun in early August, it added its heat to the sun's. (Sirius' nickname, the ""Dog Star,"" is the origin of the phrase ""dog days of summer"" for this time period.)
A star's proper name may derive from a different myth than that of the constellation it is in. The star Alkaid was seen as the leader of a funeral procession and so named by the Egyptians, but the constellation it is found in, Ursa Major, was seen as a bear by the Greeks.;
, Many stars' proper names derive from their position within their own constellation or a neighboring constellation.


The bright star Deneb in the constellation Cygnus comes from the Arabic for ""tail,"" as it represents the swan's tail. Likewise, the star Denebola in Leo represents the lion's tail, and the star Deneb Kaitos in Cetus represents the whale's tail.
�Betelgeuse"" means ""armpit"" and ""Rigel"" means ""foot"" in Arabic; the stars Betelgeuse and Rigel are the right armpit and left foot, respectively, of the constellation Orion.
The name of the star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes means ""bear driver'; it follows the constellations Ursa Major and Ursa Minor as they orbit the Celestial North Pole.

, Some proper star names derive from properties astronomers were able to observe, either with the naked eye or crude lenses.


The star Algol in Perseus takes its name from the Arabic ""al ghul,"" meaning ""ghoul"" or ""demon."" The star is an eclipsing binary that appears dimmer when the dimmer star is closer to Earth than the brighter star. (The star represents the head of Medusa, the Gorgon slain by Perseus.)
The star Mira in Cetus takes its name from the Latin word meaning ""wonderful"" (the same root as ""miracle""). It is a variable star that changes in brightness over a regular period of time.

, While modern star registries allow people to give unofficial names to stars to honor themselves or their loved ones, a few official proper star names were given for similar reasons. The star Cor Caroli in the constellation Canes Venatici was named in honor of Great Britain's King Charles II; its name means ""Charles' Heart.""

"

Name a star for its brightness within its constellation.,
Name a star for its position within its constellation.,
Name a star according to its right ascension and declination, without regard to its constellation.",How to Name a Star2," Around 1600, German astronomer Johannes Bayer developed the first modern system for naming stars based on their apparent brightness within their constellation. He used Greek letters to rank stars from brightest to dimmest (""Alpha"" being brightest and ""Omega"" being dimmest), followed by upper and lowercase Roman letters when he ran out of Greek letters. A star's name was composed of its brightness rank and the possessive form of its name, thus the brightest star in the constellation Centaurus was designated Alpha Centauri under Bayer's system.


Bayer's system did not always name stars purely by their brightness; sometimes he also took the position of the star within its constellation into account. Bayer designated Castor as ""Alpha Geminorum"" and Pollux as ""Beta Geminorum,"" even though Pollux is actually brighter than Castor, because Castor appears above and to the right of Pollux in the sky.
Bayer's method was later modified by adding letters after star names to indicate individual stars within a multiple star system, such as Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, and numbers after the magnitude designator, as in Pi-1 Orionis, Pi-2 Orionis, and so on.

, Developed by John Flamsteed in the 18th century, the Flamsteed method numbered the westernmost star within a constellation as ""1,"" the next westernmost as ""2,"" and so on, using the possessive name as a suffix. The westernmost star in Leo would thus be designated 1-Leonis in the Flamsteed system.


The Bayer and Flamsteed naming conventions are often used in conjunction with proper star names. If a star has a proper name, it is generally known by that; if not, by its Bayer name; if it has neither a proper name or a Bayer name, then by its Flamsteed number. The main exception to this rule is Alpha Centauri, which is known by its Bayer name instead of its proper name of Toliman (and by aviators and mariners as Rigil Kentaurus).

, Because the system of proper names, Bayer names, and Flamsteed numbers favors brighter stars and ignores the larger number of dimmer stars, a different method was necessary to catalog all the stars in the night sky. This method involves cataloging a star by its right ascension, its distance from the vernal equinox, and its declination from the Celestial Equator. Such catalogs often break the sky into strips of either right ascension (celestial longitude) or declination (celestial latitude) and enumerate stars within these strips.


The Harvard Revised Bright Star Catalogue (now compiled at Yale University) lists 9000 stars down to 6th magnitude from west to east. The star Vega in the constellation Lyra is known as HR 7001 in this catalogue.
The 19th century Bonner Durchmusterung (Bonn Survey) covered stars visible in the northern sky down to 10th magnitude, dividing each degree of declination into its strip. In this catalog, Vega would be designated BD38 3238. (A companion survey, the Cordoba Durchmusterung, covered the southern sky.)
The most commonly used star catalog today is the Henry Draper catalog, which numbers its stars solely by right ascension. In it, Vega is designated HD 172167. Other star catalogs include the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observation and the Hipparcos International Catalogue; Vega is designated as SAO 067174 and HIC 91262 in these catalogs, respectively.

These refer to the locations where you can view the sky section. If you're keen on seeing a certain constellation but you don't live where you can see it, you'll need to plan a grand expedition! (For example, stars that can be seen in the far northern latitudes cannot be seen in the far southern latitudes, and vice versa, because they do not rise above the horizon.) Some constellations, such as Orion, can be seen across most of the inhabited world.


Sky maps look flat to us but that is so that they can fit inside a flat book. In reality, the sky is like a dome.;
, Most amateur astronomers tend to look for those constellations that have notable features or recognizable star patterns.


What you will be able to see when looking in a particular constellation not only depends on your geographic location but also on your equipment and local light pollution. Stars with a magnitude 6.5 and greater can usually be seen with the naked eye or with standard binoculars. You can also look for star clusters, nebulae, differently colored stars and galaxies.
Many constellations have been known for thousands of years. In the time of ancient Greece, 48 constellations were noted by Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer.

, You will need something comfortable and waterproof to lie on while stargazing. Otherwise, moisture from the soil beneath you can leach upwards, making your experience messy.

, The night sky is filled with thousands of stars, as many as 2500 to 5000 visible to the naked eye.Looking through a picture frame will help capture within your view a small portion of the stars above you.

, Look for closely grouped clusters of stars. Brighter stars will be easier to spot and work with. Planets, the most brilliant objects in the night sky after the moon, can be useful too.

, Throughout history sailors and navigators have looked for patterns in the arrangement of stars. See if you can assemble any stars into the outline of a familiar object: a cat, house or tree. If you’ve ever practiced cloud-gazing, it’s a similar process.

, Now imagine drawing straight lines between these prominent points in the sky. Can you see the outline of your object taking shape?

, Branch out and try to create a new constellation rather than merely copying an existing one. Going beyond the norm gives you an opportunity to be truly creative!

, Now that you’ve created a new star system you need to locate it in relation to an existing constellation so you don’t lose track of it. There are a number of online star maps you can consult and print off as a reference. You might be able to see a portion of your new constellation within part of an existing cluster. If so, grab your flashlight, pen and paper and take note of its position compared to a well-known cluster.

, With your flashlight, pen and paper start drawing the stars in your constellation. Take note of the brighter stars and dimmer stars and label them accordingly. Use larger dots for bigger stars and smaller dots for dimmer stars. You might also want to draw lines between star endpoints to give your constellation its final shape.

, Choose a title for your constellation. There are currently 88 named constellations in use by astronomers today.That leaves you thousands of possibilities for labeling. So the sky’s the limit!

Provide explanations below the chart.",How to Make a Moon Phases Chart," This is vital to being able to create an accurate chart. There are eight main phases of the moon, each lasting roughly 3.5 days. The phase of the moon depends upon the way in which the moon is positioned in relation to the sun and earth at any given time. The eight phases are:New moon
Waxing crescent
First quarter
Waxing gibbous
Full moon
Waning gibbous
Last quarter
Waning crescent;
, Different positions of the moon relative to the earth and sun produce the visible phases of the moon. The moon phases chart is designed to describe the visibility of the moon at different points as it orbits the earth. By placing Earth in the center of your chart, you keep this concept in perspective., The sun is typically placed on the right side of the chart. This is important, because the moon phase depends upon the moon’s relation to both the earth and the sun. If you place the sun to the left of the earth, you would have to move all of the moon phases to match this new position.The relationship of these three bodies is important, but the actual determination of right or left side is arbitrary. The earth orbits the sun and the sun is never at a stationary “left or right” in relation to the earth.

, The new moon occurs when the moon is between the earth and the sun. At this point in the moon’s orbit, it cannot be seen from the side of the earth pointing away from the sun (the side that’s dark). Draw or fasten a new moon (all dark/shadowed) directly between the earth and sun.In astrology, the new moon symbolizes birth or new beginnings. It is thought to be a good time to start a new project., From the point of the new moon, move counterclockwise by 45 degrees to draw or place the waxing crescent. This moon phase occurs when the moon has moved through roughly ⅛ of it’s orbit (less than three days after the new moon). At this point in the orbit, there is a sliver of the moon that is lit by the sun’s light, and visible to the side of the earth experiencing night (pointing away from the sun).The crescent phase is often associated with struggle and growth in astrology. It is thought to be a good time to take opportunities., Move counterclockwise 90 degrees from the new moon (or 45 degrees from the waxing crescent) to place or draw the first quarter moon. When the moon appears as a half circle in the sky, this is known as a quarter moon because the moon has moved through ¼ of its orbit. This moon phase can be observed around seven to ten days into the moon’s cycle.Astrological themes surrounding the first quarter phase are action and expression. It is considered a good time to take the first steps to communicate your goals and achieve them., Move another 45 degrees counterclockwise (135 degrees from the new moon) to place the waxing gibbous. During this phase, the moon moves closer and closer to being a full circle in the sky. The waxing gibbous is observed from roughly eleven to fourteen days into the moon cycle.During the waxing gibbous phase, astrologists suggest that you focus on analyzing the results of the actions that you initiated in the first quarter phase.

, The full moon is the climax of the waxing phases. It is also the beginning of the waning phases. As the moon continues its orbit, it will become less and less visible. The placement of the full moon on your chart should be 180 degrees from the new moon (straight across from the new moon on the other side of the earth).Astrologically, the full moon represents illumination. During this phase, it is thought that one will have a clear view of their previous actions so that they can make appropriate adjustments., The waning gibbous should be placed 45 degrees counterclockwise with respect to the full moon. Stages of the waning gibbous appear to be inverted from stages of the waxing gibbous. The parts of the moon that were dark at a given phase of the waxing gibbous will be light at a similar phase of the waning gibbous and vice versa.In astrology, the waning gibbous is also referred to as the disseminating moon. It is considered a time to reflect upon any changes made during the full moon phase., The third quarter moon should be placed 90 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon. The third quarter moon appears as the inverse of the first quarter moon. This phase marks the point at which the moon has traveled through ¾ of its orbit.The third quarter moon, or last quarter moon, is considered a time for revising and cleansing by astrologists. It is thought to be the time to bring closure to projects started during the new moon phase., The waning crescent is the last moon phase in the cycle. It should be placed on the chart 135 degrees counterclockwise from the full moon (45 degrees counterclockwise from the waning gibbous). This will complete a circle around the earth with eight different points representing the eight moon phases.In astrology, the waning crescent is also known as the balsamic moon. This is considered a time to let go and release any things that do not pertain to the next moon cycle.

, Explain each moon phase in a caption. This way, anyone reading the chart can immediately work out which phase of the moon they are looking at and why it is named that. For example:


New moon: This is the beginning of the moon phases when the moon is hidden from sight.
Waxing crescent: This is the sliver of a crescent when the moon begins to be visible.
First quarter: Appears as a half circle in the sky.
Waxing gibbous: More than half of a circle is illuminated as the moon moves toward a full moon.
Full moon: The entire moon appears lit up by the sun, so you can see a whole circle.
Waxing gibbous: The illumination of the moon starts to shrink again.
Last quarter: Appears as a half circle in the sky.
Waning crescent: The last phase of the moon as it becomes less and less visible.

Track Mars’ orbit.,
View Mars on the date of opposition.,
Aim for ideal weather conditions.",How to Observe Mars1," For optimal viewing of the Mars, track its orbit with a sky map or chart to keep track of its distance from Earth. A sky map is a map of the night sky that indicates the location of planets, stars, constellations, and other celestial bodies.Interactive versions are available online (for an example, visit http://www.sky-map.org/), or you can download an app for your smart phone. Make sure to get the right map for your current location, and for the current date., Mars’ closest approach to Earth occurs every 26 months, but it appears the brightest eight days earlier, on the date of opposition. This date marks the point in the planet’s orbit when it rises in the east as the sun sets, which makes it visible in our sky overnight. While there are many other opportunities to view Mars in the night sky, this biennial event should not be missed if you are truly interested in observing the planet., Ensure that the weather will be favorable and the skies will be clear for the night and time when you intend to observe Mars. Cloudy skies, and certainly precipitation, will impede your viewing. Consult a local weather report, or a clear sky chart online to predict weather conditions for the near future."
"
Research telescopes.,
Choose from 3 types of telescopes.,
Look for a telescope with higher aperture.,
Purchase color filters.",How to Observe Mars2," A telescope is a pricey but integral part of observing Mars, so you should put a good deal of thought into choosing one. As a general rule, you should be focused on finding a telescope with good optics and a sturdy mount that moves smoothly. With this in mind, read reviews online and look for beginner telescopes that have these features and have good ratings., While any telescope can facilitate your observation of Mars, there are three kinds of telescope on the market to choose from. These three types use different optics to enhance distant objects and make them look larger to the eye. The options are:Refractors, where you have a lens at the front of the tube; these are popular and low-maintenance, but can be expensive depending on the model.
Reflectors, which gather light with a mirror at the back of the tube; these are less expensive but require more adjustment when used.
Compound telescopes, which use a combination of lenses and mirrors.

, As a general rule, the bigger the telescope, the better. Look for telescopes with a higher aperture, which refers to the diameter of its light-gathering lens or mirror. Opt for a telescope with an aperture of 4 inches (10.2 cm) or more, which can pick up greater detail on a planet or other celestial body., If you opt to buy them, color filters can add a lot to your experience of viewing Mars. These filters screw onto the tip of your telescope, and work by controlling the type and quantity of light that your eyes receive by either reflecting or transmitting it.Some specific filters that might enhance your Mars observation are:Orange (#21): increases contrast and penetrates clouds and haze
Red (#25, #29): enhances surface details
Yellow (#12, #15): brightens desert regions, darkens blue and brown features
Green (#57): darkens red and blue features
Blue (#80A, #38, #38A): shows clouds and darken reddish features

Set up your equipment.,
Focus on different elements of the planet.,
Sketch what you see.,
View Mars with your naked eye.,
Join an astronomy club.",How to Observe Mars3," Find a spot that is unobstructed, dark, and on level, solid ground to set up your telescope. Leave your telescope outdoors for an hour or two before using it to allow the equipment to adjust to the climate; the shift from indoor to outdoor temperatures could cause the telescope’s optics to fog up, affecting the view. To make your viewing more efficient later, align your finderscope (i.e. the aiming device in your telescope) ahead of time; focus on a distant object and adjust the settings to fix the view.Bring a flashlight with you to set up and later pack up you telescope in the dark.

, A lot of the excitement about viewing Mars is due to the notable features of the planet's surface; these features are more distinguishable than Earth's due to Mars' smaller size, thin atmosphere, and lack of erosion.Some key features that observers look for are:Mars’ polar ice caps
the pale haze that forms over polar regions
albedo markings (i.e. variations of light and dark on the surface of the planet, marking an alternation of bedrock and desert sands)
clouds in the planet's atmosphere

, Sketching Mars during your observations is an excellent way of making yourself think about what you are seeing; experienced observers spend years sketching the planet to note any intriguing details on its surface or in its orbit. Be patient in order to capture fine details accurately; draw the foremost features first (e.g. the polar ice caps) and then add finer details (e.g. clouds, haze). Be sure to note the date, time, and filters used (if any) to establish the full context of your observation., While using a telescope is the ideal way to view Mars in great detail, the planet can also be an impressive sight for the naked eye. The weeks surrounding Mars’ opposition with the Sun and its closest approach to earth are the best times to view the planet without equipment. Track the dates with a sky map; Mars should be viewable throughout the evening during this time period.Use an app like Sky Map to track where the planet is.

, If your interest in viewing Mars is keen enough, consider joining a local astrology club to meet others with the same passion. This is a great way to interact with experienced group members who can offer advice about equipment and other important aspects of astronomy. Group meetings may involve learning new techniques and trying new equipment, which will enhance your astronomy skills and make your observations of Mars even better.Your local planetarium may also offer resources for advancing your astronomy skills, including lessons on how to use a telescope and relevant shows about Mars.

Now it's time to use your star chart.",How to Make and Use Star Charts," You will need:


A large piece of paper.
A set of giant compasses.
A 30 cm (or larger) ruler.
A protractor.
A pencil and an eraser.
The co-ordinates of the stars that you want on your chart - available online.;
, If your paper is large enough (and I'm assuming it is) draw a circle with a radius of one foot.

, The circles should have radii of 1 inch , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 inches, and the centres should be in the same place as the centre of the big circle.

, From the centre of the circle, draw six radii, at 0 degrees, 60, 120, 180, 240 and 300 degrees.

,,, Where the 0 degree radius meets the one foot circle, write 0h. Going clockwise (anticlockwise if you are mapping the southern hemisphere), the other radius-circle meeting points are 1h, 2h, 3h, and so on, up to 23h. These are now the names of the radii, e.g. the 15h radius. At the point where the radii meet, in the middle, write 90. If you're mapping the northern hemisphere, write +90, southern hemisphere: -90. Moving outwards, label the circles as +80, +70, +60, +50, +40, +30, +20, +10, 0, -10, -20, and the outer circle should be -30. If you're mapping the southern hemisphere, change + to - and - to +.

, You can find the co-ordinates on the internet. To plot a star, start at the middle. Move outwards, along the 0h radius, until you are at the correct declination. Then, move clockwise until you are at the correct right ascension. Draw a dot to mark the star. You may wish to connect the stars in each constellation so that you can see the patterns.

, If you can, write the star's magnitude (how bright it is), name and designation.

, Firstly, you need to find some stars that you know, so you can find them on your chart. For northerners, I'd recommend the big dipper or Cassiopeia. For southerners, I'd recommend Carina or Centaurus. Once you've found where you are on the chart, it will show you where other stars are, in relation to the ones you've found.

Divide 3.12E9 by the result.",How to Measure the Distance to a Galaxy," These are available on the NED or MAST DSS websites.;
, Although this can be done on a computer screen using Gimp.

,


The spiral galaxy will have spiral arms which will cross the line you have drawn at regular intervals. Make a measure of the distance between these intervals. You may use a ruler on a printed out photo and take an average, or use the measuring device in Gimp, or use MATLAB to extract the pixels along the major axis and apply a fast Fourier transform onto the extracted set of pixels if you are a geek.

, The photo will also have its width given in pixels. Or, if you have used a ruler, you can measure the width of the photo in inches or centimeters. The purpose of this is to convert the measured interval length between spiral arms along the major axis of the galaxy into arc minutes. It is important to measure, or determine, this interval in arc minutes. And with a little algebra, this is very easy to do. You do not have to be a geek to do it.

, Luckily, a vast number of galaxies have had their rotation speeds measured and these can be found online. Look for galactic rotation profiles or rotation curves and find one for your galaxy. There is a way to find out how fast a galaxy is spinning using line widths, but that is not covered here.


When and if you find your galaxy's rotation profile, it will be a graph of rotation velocity vs radial distance from the centre of the galaxy. The velocity of rotation will flatten out to some maximum velocity, almost always given in Kilometers per second (kps). You will need to measure this maximum rotational velocity as best you can in kps. Ignore every thing about dark matter; it is completely irrelevant.

,, That is the distance to the galaxy in parsecs. If you multiply that distance by 3.26, that is the distance in light years.

A paper log is easier to take into the field with you than is a laptop computer, although you may find it easier to keep records on a computer than in printed form. Computer-based astronomy record keeping programs offer the options of pre-printed log forms and the ability to generate reports, as well as an astronomical database that can help you identify objects and the ability to search your own records to track the positions of planets and comets over time.


You may want to use several methods, such as a small notebook you carry into the field on which you make notes, which you transcribe to either a larger notebook or binder or onto a computer.
Some amateur astronomers like to include sketches with their notes. If you're one of them, you'll need to have a hard surface under your note-taking paper, such as a small clipboard.
Several websites offer pre-printed astronomy log forms you can use to record your observations on. One such site is that run by the American Association of Amateur Astronomers (http://www.astromax.org/aa02801.htm);
;
, The sooner you can commit your observation to print or computer, the more accurate your records will be-�not to mention that you may forget to do so entirely if you wait too long. This is where taking a simple notepad into the field with you may help.

, This may include some or all of the following:


The day and date of your observation session. You can record the date in either American format (month, day, year) or European/military format (day, month, year), although you may want to write out or use the abbreviation for the month name to avoid confusion on the part of others who may read your observing log.
The times your observing session began and ended. If your observing log includes sketches, include the times those sketches were made. Time should be expressed in Universal (Greenwich Mean) Time, or your local time, with the mention of whether it was Standard or Daylight Time.
Your observation location, preferably including your latitude and longitude, but at least the specific area you were conducting your observations in (city, state, backyard, field, park, etc.).
What kind of telescope you were using (refractor/reflector � Newtonian, Dobsonian), its focal length, eyepiece, magnification, apparent field of view, and any notes on its performance. If you use a lens filter, note how images compare with and without the filter.
What you were observing, including a detailed physical description and/or a sketch. Include an estimate of the object's size based on the angular field of view of your telescope's eyepiece. If the object is a comet, name the constellation the comet appears in and the constellations you searched to find it. If the object is a star cluster, include a count of how many stars you can see. If the object is a nebula or galaxy, include a description of how concentrated the stars or glowing gases are.
The amount of moonlight, which can affect how well you can see dimmer stars. You can also include an estimate of the apparent magnitude of the dimmest stars you can see directly overhead (transparency) and the approximate arc-second diameter of star images (seeing).
The local weather conditions, including the percentage of cloud cover, and any mist, fog, or haze.
You can also include non-astronomical observations such as the presence of wildlife or sources of light or other pollution that hamper your ability to see the sky. If you're sharing your observing session with other amateur astronomers, you may want to include their names and notes on their equipment for posterity. You can also include personal thoughts.

Look for the Pleiades in autumn and winter.,
Face the southern sky.,
Find Orion.,
Follow the line of the belt to Aldebaran.,
Move onward to find the Pleiades.,
Use Taurus as a guide next time.",How to Find the Pleiades Star Cluster1," In the Northern Hemisphere, the Pleiades star cluster becomes visible to evening observers in October and disappears in April. November is the best time to look for the Pleiades, when they are visible from dusk to dawn and reach their highest point in the sky.In early October, the Pleiades become visible a couple hours after sunset. By about February, the Pleiades are already high in the sky at sunset.(The exact timing depends on your latitude.)
The Pleiades are visible in late summer and early autumn as well, but only in the middle of the night.;
, The Pleiades rise in the southeast after dusk and travel west during the night. During their peak in November, they climb high in the sky and disappear in the northwest before dawn. In late winter and early spring, they will only be visible for a few hours, traveling east to west across the southern part of the sky., Orion the Hunter is one of the most famous and distinct constellations in the sky. On a winter evening at a mid-northern latitude, he stands almost due south, about halfway between the horizon and the sky directly above your head.Locate him by his belt, a straight line of three bright stars close together. The red star nearby, Betelgeuse, forms his left shoulder (from your perspective), while the blue giant Rigel on the other side of the belt is his right leg., Treat Orion's belt as an arrow pointing to your next landmark, moving from left to right in the sky. (At most times and places, this will point to the northwest.) The next bright star you see in this direction is another bright, red-orange star: Aldebaran. This is the Arabic word for ""Follower,"" likely named because it chases the Pleiades each night.Aldebaran is not in a perfect line with the belt. Don't try to get there with binoculars, or you may miss it.
Aldebaran dips below the horizon around March, or earlier in extreme northern latitudes.If Aldebaran isn't visible, try to follow Orion's belt all the way to Pleiades.

, Continue moving your eyes in the same direction (usually northwest), from Orion's belt to Aldebaran and beyond. Fairly near to Aldebaran, you should see a tight cluster of blue stars. These are the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters or M45.Most people can only see six stars with the naked eye, or even just a hazy clump if light pollution interferes.With a clear night and keen, dark-adjusted eyes, you may see more than seven.
The Seven Sisters are clustered close together. From end to end the cluster is only ⅔ the width of Orion's Belt.This is much less than the length of the Big Dipper or Little Dipper, star patterns which some novice stargazers confuse with this one.

, The red star Aldebaran, described above, is also the eye of the constellation Taurus, the Bull. The Hyades star cluster nearby forms the chin of the bull. If you become familiar with this constellation, you can find it as a starting point and look for the Pleiades nearby.Taurus may be difficult to see during a bright moon, especially near an urban area."
"
Watch for the Pleiades in spring and summer.,
Face the northern sky.,
Look for a line of bright stars.,
Follow the line left in the sky to Aldebaran.,
Continue on to the Pleiades.",How to Find the Pleiades Star Cluster2," The Pleiades are visible from about October to April, during the Southern Hemisphere's spring and summer months.

, During late November, the Pleiades rise in the northeast around dusk and travel west until dawn. As the seasons progress, the Pleiades start higher in the sky when the stars appear, and spend less time in the sky.

, Orion is standing on his head in the Southern Hemisphere, so some observers call this constellation a sauce pan instead, with Orion's sword the handle pointing upward.The rim of the saucepan (or Orion's belt) is a trio of bright stars in a straight line. This distinct shape is a starting point for locating many constellations.


This line has the bright red star Betelgeuse on one side, and the bright blue star Rigel on the other.

, Use the line as an arrow pointing left across the sky. The next bright star in this direction is Aldebaran, a bright red supergiant. This is the eye of the constellation Taurus the Bull. If the sky is clear and the moon is dim, you can see the chin of the bull right next to Aldebaran, formed by the Hyades star cluster.

, Keep following the same line from Orion's belt, and you'll run into a fairly dim cluster of blue stars. These are the Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters — although most people can only see six or fewer, and telescopes can see many more. The Pleiades are an ""asterism,"" a star pattern much smaller than a constellation. If you hold your thumb out at arm's length, the cluster is only about twice the width of your thumbnail."

The chart below represents a typical summer night (in this case July 14th at 9pm local/10pm local DST) at roughly 35° north (close to the latitude for the cities of Memphis, Tennessee (USA), Tokyo (Japan) and Tehran (Iran)).,
Now that we've found the Summer Triangle, we can identify the three constellations associated with those stars: Lyra the Harp, Aquila the Eagle and Cygnus the Swan.

,
To our right (the west), and a little further north, you will find the Big Dipper (also known as the Plough), which is actually another asterism (more on that later).,
Let's locate another bright constellation.,
Now that we've located some of the brighter constellations, let's use them to locate some of the fainter constellations.,
Let's move west and back to the bright star Arcturus.,
Moving back to the south and Scorpius, we can locate the ""Teapot"" asterism, which is made up of the brightest members of the constellation Sagittarius the Archer (an interesting fact; the area just above the ""spout"" and between Scorpius marks the direction of the center of the Milky Way, our galactic home).

,
Moving back north now.,
If you continue to follow our line through Polaris, you will come to a constellation that lies almost directly opposite the sky of Ursa Major.,
Finally, we'll locate one of the smallest of the 88 official constellations, just to the east of the Summer Triangle.",How to Find Your Way Around the Summer Night Sky," Looking straight up, facing south, you'll notice three bright stars to your left (the east). These stars are Vega, Altair and Deneb. They form a large asterism known as the Summer Triangle.;
,, Follow the curve of the handle south towards a very bright star; ""arc to Arcturus"", the brilliant orange star that marks the constellation Boötes the Herdsman.

, This one is perhaps the best looking summer constellation, Scorpius the Scorpion, which lies due south. The brightest star in Scorpius is Antares, a red giant.

, Draw an invisible line from Deneb through Vega and a little further west. This will lead you to the constellation Hercules the Hero.

, Since we've already followed the ""arc to Arcturus"", we can now ""spike to Spica"", which is the brightest star in the constellation Virgo the Maiden.

,, Earlier, we referred to the Big Dipper (the Plough) as an asterism. It is actually part of a large constellation known as Ursa Major, the Big Bear. If you follow an invisible line from the two stars opposite the handle (the ""pointers""), you'll find that they point almost directly towards Polaris, the North Star, which is at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, another asterism. This is actually Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.

, This is Cassiopeia the Queen, one of the major autumn constellations.

, This is Delphinus the Dolphin (which truly looks like its namesake).

Wait for the right time of year.,
Look in the right part of the sky for the nebula.,
Identify the best latitude to see the Orion Nebula from.,
Find the Belt of Orion.,
Find Betelgeuse and Rigel.,
Identify the Orion Nebula.",How to Find the Orion Nebula1," Because of the slow orbit of the earth around the sun, the nebula is not visible all year round. The nebula is visible from late autumn to early spring.The constellation Orion, which contains the Orion Nebula, is highest in the sky around midnight in mid-December., Due to the spherical nature of the earth, the direction the nebula will appear in is relative to your position on our planet. In the northern hemisphere, look to the southwest. In the southern hemisphere, look to the northwest., The nebula is best seen from latitudes of 85 and -75 degrees. In other words, if you’re hanging out with polar bears in the North Pole or penguins in the South Pole, you won’t be seeing the Orion Nebula.You can identify what hemisphere you’re in by looking at a map. If the country you’re in lies south of the equator, you’re in the southern hemisphere. If the country you’re in lies north of the equator, you’re in the northern hemisphere.

, The Belt of Orion is one of the most recognizable asterisms (a group of stars in an identifiable cluster). It is composed of three very bright stars -- Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka -- in a line, relatively equidistant from one another. The Belt and the Orion Nebula both lie within the constellation Orion, so knowing where the Belt is will help you know you're in the neighborhood of the nebula.

, If you imagine the Belt of Orion as perfectly parallel to your line of sight, and thus forming a vertical line, Betelgeuse and Rigel are two stars which sit on either side of the Belt. The path from Betelgeuse through Alnilam (the middle star in the Belt) and on to Rigel forms an almost straight line. Rigel and Betelgeuse are about equidistant from Alnilam.


Betelgeuse is a red supergiant and, true to its name, glows a dull red-orange. It is located up and to the left of the Belt of Orion if you’re in the northern hemisphere, and down and to the right of the Belt if you’re in the southern hemisphere.Rigel is a blue-white star located down and to the right of the Belt of Orion if you’re in the northern hemisphere, and up and to the left if you’re in the southern hemisphere., The Orion Nebula is located just to one side of the line between Rigel and Alnilam, the middle star in the Belt of Orion. The nebula is a faint, fuzzy blue patch in the Sword of Orion, an asterism composed of Iota Orionis (just below the Orion Nebula if viewed from the northern hemisphere), the Orion Nebula, and NGC 1981 (an open star cluster visible just below the Orion Nebula if viewed from the northern hemisphere)."

Orient yourself to the chart’s directions.,
Identify nearby stars and constellations.,
Lift the star chart above your head.",How to Find the Orion Nebula2," In other words, hold your star chart in such a way that the compass directions are aligned in the same way your body is. If, for instance, you’re facing south (as you should to see M42), hold the star chart in such a way that the southern edge of the chart is at the bottom and the northern edge is at the top. Ensure your star chart is for the current season.

, Unless you have an exquisitely detailed star chart, the Orion Nebula will not be explicitly labeled, though it should appear as a point on the chart. However, using the star chart to locate nearby objects in the night sky will help you find it.


The Orion Nebula is located just to one side of the line between Alnilam (the middle star in the Belt of Orion) and Rigel in the constellation Orion. These and other major features of the night sky will provide relative guide you to where you can locate it.
There are several major stars and constellations around M42 which can help you locate it. The Belt of Orion is one such constellation. Locating it with your star chart should be easy.
The constellation Orion is a major constellation and lends the Orion Nebula its name. Orion is located at the intersection of Taurus, Lepus, and Gemini.

, Your star chart will mirror the appearance of the night sky. Think of it as an astronomical map. With the chart in an overhead position, you can easily identify the various stellar objects in your quadrant of the sky. Find the stellar objects you identified as near to M42, then use their relative positioning to find it.


If your star chart does have a label for M42, your job is much easier. Use it to locate the nebula.

"
"
Identify the nebula’s right ascension.,
Identify the nebula’s declination.,
Set your telescope to locate the nebula.",How to Find the Orion Nebula3," The right ascension of a celestial object is the astronomical equivalent of longitude, and measures the distance eastward from the celestial equator towards the vernal equinox (the point at which the celestial equator and ecliptic intersect during spring in the northern hemisphere.)The Orion Nebula’s right ascension is 5 hours.In other words, the nebula will cross the celestial meridian (the point directly above you or an observer) five hours after the vernal equinox.

, Declination is an astronomical equivalent to latitude, and provides guidance toward a point on the celestial sphere (the visible “sphere” of stars and astronomical objects surrounding the earth). Declination is measured relative to the celestial equator (the line you’d get if the equator were projected out into space). The Orion Nebula’s declination is five degrees.In other words, it lies along a plane five degrees above the celestial equator.

, First, you’ll need to adjust the placement of your telescope so that it is “in station,” parallel to the axis of the earth. A telescope in station would trace a direct line to the equator if the earth were flat.


Use your setting circle to find the nebula. You can designate the declination and right ascension mechanically or, on a newer scope, digitally.Look through the eyepiece to see M42.

Choose the right time.,
Pick a good location.,
Consult a star map.,
Look for Venus and Jupiter.,
Locate Mercury near Venus.,
Keep looking for Saturn and Mars.",How to Find the Planets1," If you want to observe the planets with your naked eye, timing is key. The best time to look for planets is roughly 45 minutes before sunrise. Depending on the time of year and your location, the precise timing of sunrise will vary. You may want to spend a few days tracking sunrise before attempting to observe the planets so you'll know a good time to go out., You will want to choose a location where you can look in the rough direction of the sunrise. This means there should be no buildings, trees, or other landmarks blocking your view.If you live in a rural area, it should be fairly easy to find a location free of obstruction. However, make sure you watch out for larger trees as these can block your view of the planets.
If you live in an urban area, you can try standing on a large structure like a rooftop or parking garage. This can allow you to see over the buildings to observe the planets.

, While the planets generally fall near the sunrise and their order remains the same, their precise location changes by season. You may have to look farther east some times of the year to properly see the planets. You can purchase a star map or star atlas at a bookstore, which will provide you with varying maps of the skyline by season and location. You can also find star maps online, many of which will be calibrated to the current season and your location. It's a good idea to review a star map before you set out to view the planets., Venus will the easiest planet to find with the naked eye as it's by far the brightest. Jupiter is the second brightest, so it will also be fairly easy to locate. If you look slightly to the south of the sun, you should see what looks like an abnormally bright star in the sky. This is actually Venus. If you look slightly farther south, you should see another bright star. This is Jupiter.The location of Venus and Jupiter will change by season, and it may be easier to find in the months of January and February. Consult your star map to calibrate for your time of year.

, Mercury is the planet closest to the sun. If you look slightly to the lower left of Venus, you will see another brighter star in the sky. This is Mercury.Mercury can be particularly hard to find as it's not as bright as the other planets. Mercury sometimes hides behind twilight or clouds. Unfortunately, if the sky is not clear you may not be able to locate Mercury with the naked eye.

, Saturn and Mars will be located between Venus and Jupiter. They may not always be visible to the naked eye. In the months of February and January, they may be easier to spot. Saturn will be closer to Venus, while Mars will be closer to Jupiter.You can use color to find Saturn and Mars. Saturn will have a yellowish glow that distinguishes it from other stars. Mars will appear rusty or reddish in color.
Keep in mind it's difficult to find Saturn and Mars during certain times of the year. Sometimes, they may not be visible with the naked eye at all. Consult your star map before going out to see if it's possible to find Saturn and Mars that morning.

"
"
Examine Mercury with binoculars.,
Prepare your telescope.,
Look at Venus up close through a telescope.,
Use your telescope to examine the cloud belts and moons of Jupiter.",How to Find the Planets2," As Mercury is not particularly bright, and is often obscured by clouds, you may need binoculars to find it. Try pointing a pair of binoculars into the sky and moving them slightly to the lower left of Venus. You may be able to find a small, bright star-like object. This is Mercury.You do not necessarily need expensive binoculars. However, if you enjoy stargazing, you may want to invest in a more expensive brand. Decent binoculars can go for $200 and may give you a better view of all the planets.
Mercury is very close to the sun, so be careful when using binoculars. If you point your binoculars into the sun by mistake, you could cause damage to your retinas.

, If you want to get a more up close look of the planets, try using a telescope. You can buy a telescope online, and then use it to locate the planets.Before going out to observe the planets, follow the instructions manual to set up your telescope at home. Make sure you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the new device. See how the knobs and handles work, reading the manual as necessary. You don't want to be confused as to how to use your telescope when you're trying to find planets.

, Once you're comfortable using your telescope, take it out around 45 minutes before sunrise to observe the planets. As with looking at the planets with the naked eye, it's best to start with Venus. You can easily locate Venus with the naked eye, as it's the bright star a little to the south of the coming sunrise. Once you've found Venus, you can point your telescope towards it and observe.Venus takes many different shapes and colors depending on the time of year. It may be a good idea to consult a star atlas to get a sense of what Venus will look like during the time of year you're observing. This will give you a sense of what to look for.
Keep in mind that while telescopes will enhance your view of the planets, you will not receive images on par with something from the Hubble Telescope. Most images you see in the night sky will appear grayish and somewhat distant, even with the aid of a telescope.

, Once you've found Venus, you can swing your telescope to the right. You can get a great view of Jupiter by looking through a telescope as you'll be able to see its belts and some of its moons.You may see two dusty belts in Jupiter's midsection. These are the belts of Jupiter, which you can observe closely with a telescope.
You may also see a few moons on either side of the planet, which are somewhat aligned with the belt.

"
"
Use smart phone applications.,
Download an application for your computer.,
Try using a star atlas.",How to Find the Planets3," As the night sky changes so much based on the time of year, it can be tough to locate the planets. You can download applications on your smart phone that provide you with an interactive map of the solar system.


If you have an Android, you can download an application called Stellarium. This application provides an interactive 3D map of the solar system based on the time of year. Stellarium can also help you identify objects in the sky, such as planets, if you point your phone at an unknown object.For an iPhone or iPad, try SkyGuide. This is an interactive map similar to what you would find on Stellarium. You can take your phone with you when stargazing to help identify and locate the planets., You can also put a map of the solar system on the desktop of your computer. Before you go Stargazing, you can simply consult your desktop to get an idea of where to look for that night. Stellarium, in addition to being available on mobile phones, can be downloaded on a desktop. For Macs, an application called PhotoPils can be used to map the night sky on your desktop., If you feel like the presence of technology would distract from your star gazing experience, try investing in a star atlas. Star atlases have been around for a long time. They are books that breakdown the location of stars and plants based on location and time of year. You can purchase a star atlas online, check one out from your local library, or buy one at a bookstore.Star atlases provide maps based on time of year and region. You'll need to look in the book's index to find the proper map for your needs. When going out stargazing, take the proper star map with you and use it as a guide.
Make sure you know how to read your star map. Each star map is slightly different in terms of keys. For example, in one star map red dots may be used to signify planets. In another, blue dots may be used.

"
"
Choose the right setting.,
Locate the North Star.,
Look for Pherkad and Kochab.,
Connect the dots.,
Spring up and fall down.,
Improve your chances during the right time of year.,
Don't bother looking in the Southern Hemisphere.",How to Find the Little Dipper," Before you can find any stars, you need to make sure that the night sky you view is conducive to star gazing. This is especially important when looking for the Little Dipper, since some of the stars making it up are fairly dim.


Go out into the country. If you live in a big city or a suburb, you might be familiar with the term “light pollution.” Due to the number of streetlamps, indoor lights, porch lamps, and other various forms of electrical light shining at night in such locations, the darkness of the night sky can be difficult to see. As a result, stars are also hard to see, especially when dealing with dim stars like those found in the Little Dipper. You will need to get away from the lights of the city or suburbs if you hope to be able to see enough of the night sky to spot the Little Dipper.
Get away from obstructions. While low-rising fences, shrubs, and other small objects on the horizon are unlikely to block your view, large trees, barns, or similar structures might. Improve your odds of spotting the Little Dipper by choosing a viewing location with as few potential obstacles as possible.
Go when the weather is nice. Ideally, you should go when the sky is only partly cloudy. Too many clouds will block the stars completely. You could also try going when there are no clouds out, but these conditions could cause the moon to appear brighter, and a very bright moon can make it difficult to see some of the dimmer stars in the Little Dipper.;
, Look due north to find the North Star, or Polaris. If you want to find the Little Dipper, this will be the easiest and brightest of its stars to spot. In order to find the North Star, though, you will need to use the Big Dipper.


Find the Big Dipper, first. There is no simple trick to doing this other than simply looking. The Big Dipper rotates around the North Star, and the North Star always lies toward the true north, so you can begin by looking toward the north. For most people in the northern parts of the continental United States, the Big Dipper is usually somewhere around the halfway point between the top of the night sky and the horizon. Adjust for latitude based on your location. For instance, as you get further south, look closer to the horizon to spot the Big Dipper. As you get further north, look closer to the top of the sky.
Identify Dubhe and Merak. These are two stars that make up the bowl of the Big Dipper, and they are also known as the “pointer stars” since they can be used to “point” to Polaris. More precisely, these two stars make up the outer edge of the bowl. Merak creates the ""bottom corner"" of the bowl and Dubhe stands in as that ""top corner"" of the bowl.
Draw an imaginary line connecting Merak and Dubhe. Extend this line to a point that is roughly five times longer than the length of the line itself. Somewhere around the end of this imaginary line, you should find Polaris.Polaris marks the first and brightest star in the Little Dipper, so you have effectively found the Little Dipper at this point even if you cannot make out the full shape of it. Polaris is the outermost star of the handle.

, These are two stars at the front edge of the bowl of the Little Dipper. Aside from Polaris, these two stars are the only ones that are relatively easy to see with the naked eye.


Pherkad forms the ""top corner"" of the bowl of the Little Dipper and Kochab forms the ""bottom corner"" of the bowl.
These stars are also referred to as ""Guardians of the Pole"" because they rotate or march around Polaris. They are the nearest of the bright stars to the Polaris, and if you do not count Polaris, these two stars are the nearest bright stars to the northern pole or axis of the Earth.
The brightest star is Kochab, which is a second magnitude star with an orange glow. Pherkad is a third magnitude star but should still be fairly visible.

, Once you have the three brights stars of the Little Dipper in your sight, you can gradually search the sky around those stars to find the other four stars that complete the picture.


The easiest thing way to complete the pattern is to start by completing the bowl portion. The two inner ""corners"" of the bowl are made up of fourth and fifth magnitude stars, so they can be difficult to see in poor sky conditions.
After you find the remaining bowl stars, look for the handle stars. Keep in mind that Polaris is the outermost handle star. There should be two others positioned in between the bowl and the North Star.
Note that the Little Dipper will point in the opposite direction of the Big Dipper.The handle of one will extend out in one direction, while the handle of the other will extend out in the exact opposite direction. Similarly, one will appear to be upside-down when the other appears right-side-up.

, The position of the Little Dipper varies slightly based on the current time of year. During the spring and summer, the Little Dipper tends to be a bit higher in the sky. During the fall and winter, it tends to be a bit lower and nearer to the horizon.The Earth's rotation around the sun affects how you see the group of stars. Since the Earth is tilted on an axis, your geographic location with respect to the stars forming the Little Dipper can either be nearer or further. This angle changes whether the stars appear higher or lower in the sky as you look up.

, While you can technically find the Little Dipper during any time of the year under the right circumstances, the easiest time to view it is usually during spring evenings or winter mornings.At these points in time, the stars forming the Little Dipper should be fairly high in the sky. The brightness itself will not change, but you will have a clearer view.

, As noted previously, the position of the Little Dipper and the North Star will change based on the latitude of your location. If you travel all the way south, below the Equator and into the Southern Hemisphere, the north sky and its stars, including Polaris and the two Dippers, will not be visible.


As long as you live in the Northern Hemisphere, the North Pole and both the Big and Little Dippers should be circumpolar, meaning that they can be found above the horizon. These stars lie below the horizon if you are positioned in the Southern Hemisphere, though.
Note that at the North Pole, Polaris would be directly above you in the sky. At the South Pole, Polaris would be directly below you, at a point well beyond your range of sight.

Buy some shades (sun glasses).,
Look at the sun behind tinted glass.,
Squint your eyes very tight.,
Purchase a #10 welding filter from a hardware store, automotive store, or specialty welding supply store.,
Eclipse glasses work like welder's glass.,
Developed, but unexposed photographic negatives from a 35mm camera can also be used, start with two layers and add another or remove one for comfort.,
Magnetic data storage media, such as Floppy Disks can be used as a filter for short viewing sessions, like eclipses.,
Try to cheat and look at videos of the sun.,
Finished.

",How to Look at the Sun Without Going Blind," Remember to only look for a few seconds at a time, and then look away to allow your eyes to recover. Try not to stare too often at the sun. Even with shades on it can cause some irritation to your eyes. The brightness of the sun is nothing to be taken for granted.;
, There are many cars that have tinted windows. You can look at the sun for a few moments behind the tinted glass. If the glass is not tinted thoroughly then don't stare for too long.

, Try looking at the sun while having your eyelids almost shut. This will be another good way of looking at the sun for a very short moment.

,


This specially designed glass transmits only a fraction of the sun's light and can be used to view the sun for minutes at a time. These filters do add a green tint when you look through the filter. An advantage of this method is that you can place the filter in front of a pair of binoculars, provided it's big enough to cover both sides or using a pair of filters. With the magnification provided by the binoculars, planetary transits of the sun can be observed. For extremely powerful binoculars, a #14 or #16 filter is advised for safety.
Alternatively, #5 lenses, used for oxyacetylene cutting will also work for shorter observations, like watching a solar eclipse. You can also stack two #5 filters together for the same protection as a #10.







, However, the image of the sun is a more pleasing yellow, and the glasses can be ordered in bulk, as well as be disposed after use.

, An unexposed portion remains as the leader and tail when processing 35mm format film.


This unexposed area appears at the beginning and end of the roll, but depending on the film processor you may only find the tail located after the final photograph. Nowadays the leader is removed by the processor, but if you look through old picture folders developed more than 20 years ago, you may find the 3"" leader included with the negatives as well.







, While no-longer as commonplace as they once were, it is a very inexpensive, if not free method.


For 3.5"" disks, you will have to pull off the metal door, and then pry the two plastic halves apart and pull out the plastic disc and metal hub. You can cut the plastic portion into two or more pieces with normal scissors so you can use both eyes while viewing.






For 5.25"" disks, which are now very rare indeed, cut one of the edges off in a thin strip, and slide the plastic disc out of the diskette from the hole in the center.







, Search the internet and look for videos of the sun. Find recordings of the sun without actually looking at the sun. This will not be anything like the real thing but it will be a remedy.

You also should position yourself in a spot where the northern horizon is clear.Wait until darkness falls. You aren’t going to find the Big Dipper during the daytime. The best viewing time is between March and June and around 10 p.m.;
, To find the Big Dipper, you need to look into the northern sky. Determine which direction is north using a magnetic compass or a map. Tilt your head back so that you are looking up at the sky at about a 60-degree angle.


During midsummer and autumn, the Big Dipper will be closer to the horizon, so don't look up quite so high.
If you are located north of Little Rock, Arkansas, you should be able to see the Big Dipper all night at any hour and any day of the year.If you live as far north as New York or further north, the Big Dipper should never sink below the horizon. In southern locations, it can be more difficult to see the full Big Dipper in the fall, when some of its stars may be obscured.

, The season matters here. If it’s spring or summer, the Big Dipper will be higher in the sky. If it’s fall or winter, the Big Dipper will be closer to the horizon.


The saying “spring up and fall down” will help you remember where to look for the Big Dipper.
In the fall, the Big Dipper will rest on the horizon in evening. In the winter, the handle can appear to be dangling from the bowl. You will find the Big Dipper upside down in the spring and, in the summer, the bowl will lean toward the ground.

, The Big Dipper is shaped like a bowl and a handle. There are three stars in the Big Dipper’s handle organized in a line. There are 4 stars that make up the Big Dipper’s bowl (it looks like an irregular square). The entire Big Dipper looks somewhat like a kite, with the string being the handle and the bowl being the kite itself.


The last two stars of the Big Dipper’s handle are called the pointers. They are called Dubhe and Merak. The brightest star is Alioth, which is the third star on the handle, closest to the bowl.The tip of the Big Dipper’s handle is called Alkaid. It is a hot star that means “the leader.” It is the third brightest star in Ursa Major and six times bigger than the sun. Mizar is next on the handle after Alkaid. It actually consists of two double stars.
Megrez is the star that connects the tail to the base of the bowl. It is the dimmest of the seven stars of the Big Dipper. Phecda is known as the “thigh of the bear.” It is located to the South of Megrez and makes up part of the bow.

, If you can find the North Star, you should be able to find the Big Dipper, and vice versa. The North Star is usually bright. To find it, look into the north sky up about one third of the way from the horizon to the top of the sky (which is called the zenith). The North Star is also called Polaris.


The Big Dipper rotates around the North Star through all of the seasons and through the night. The stars of the Big Dipper are as bright as those of the North Star. The North Star is often used for navigation because it points “true north.”The North Star is the brightest star in the Little Dipper and the end of its handle. Trace an imaginary line from the North Star downward, and you should be able to find the two stars in the end of the Big Dipper’s handle, which are called pointer stars because they point toward the Big Dipper. Polaris is about five stars farther away from the distance between the pointer stars themselves.

, The Big Dipper is what is called circumpolar. This means it doesn’t rise or set like the sun. Instead, it rotates around the north celestial pole.


Throughout the night, it rotates around the pole, counter-clockwise, bowl first. It makes a complete revolution around the pole once per sidereal day. A sidereal day is defined as four minutes shorter than the standard 24-hour day.
Thus, you can use the Big Dipper’s rotations to keep track of time., Some Native Americans saw the bowl of the Big Dipper as a bear. The stars of the handle were three warriors chasing it.Other Native Americans saw the Big Dipper’s bowl as the bear’s flank and its handle as the bear’s tail. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Big Dipper is called “Plough,” which derives from Nordic stargazing in which the Big Dipper was believed to be the chief god, Odin’s, wagon or chariot. In Danish, they call it “Karlsvogna” or Charles wagon.
Various cultures see the Big Dipper as something different. In China, Japan, and Korea, it’s a ladle. In northern England, a cleaver, in Germany and Hungary, a cart, and in the Netherlands, a saucepan. It’s a salmon net in Finland and a coffin in Saudi Arabia.
Escaped American slaves found their way to freedom in the north along the Underground Railroad by being told to “follow the drinking Gourd.” Thus, the Big Dipper was used as a navigational method. The Micmacs of Canada saw the Big Dipper bowl as being a celestial bear, with the three stars of its handle being hunters chasing the bear.

, The stars that make up the Big Dipper are part of the Ursa Major Moving Cluster. The furthest star from earth, Alkaid, makes up the handle and is 210 light years from earth.


The other stars are Dubhe (105 light-years from earth); Phecda (90 light-years); Mizar (88 light-years); Merak (78 light-years); Alioth (68 light-years); and Megrez (63 light-years).
These starts are in motion. Thus, in about 50,000 years, the Big Dipper will no longer retain the same shape.

, Once you’ve found the Big Dipper, you should be able to easily spot the little Dipper.


Remember that the two farthest most stars in the Big Dipper’s handle point to the North Star. The North Star is the first star in the handle of the Little Dipper.
The Little Dipper is not as bright as the Big Dipper. It looks similar to the Big Dipper, though. It has a handle made up of three stars that connects to a four-star bowl. It is harder to find the Little Dipper because the stars are not as bright in it, especially if you are in a city.

, The Big Dipper is what is called an asterism. That means it is a pattern of stars that is not a constellation. It is part of the constellation Ursa Major, the Big Bear.


The Big Dipper stars are the bear’s tail and hindquarters. The Ursa Major constellation can be best seen in April at around 9 p.m. Using a drawing for reference (there are many online) should help you sketch out the rest of the stars that form the Big Bear once you find the Big Dipper.Ursa Major is the third largest constellation and one of 88 official constellations."

Take your position on Earth into consideration.,
Find your planet’s apparition period.,
Know what time to look.,
Know when your planets are visible each night.",How to Find Planets In The Night Sky," Planets are usually much brighter than stars. Also, they are closer to earth so the more they begin to look like a disk, rather than a tiny dot., Although some of the planets may be in their apparition period, they may be harder to see if they aren’t one of the brighter planets. Jupiter and Saturn will always be the easiest to see.

, Each planet reflects the light of the sun differently. Know what color you’re looking for in the night sky.


Mercury: this planet twinkles, flashing a bright yellow color.
Venus: Venus is often mistaken for a UFO because it is large and silver.
Mars: look for a reddish planet in the night sky for Mars.
Jupiter: Jupiter glows white throughout the night. It is the second brightest point of light in the night sky.Saturn: this planet is a small yellowish-white color.

, It is easier to see the stars and planets in the night sky if you live in a rural area. If you’re in the city, it will be much more difficult to see them because of light pollution. Try to find a spot away from stray light that shines off of buildings., The planets are rarely near one another in the night sky. Knowing where to see them is very important. A great way to find them is to locate them when they appear as part of a constellation.


Mercury: Mercury will be visible near the Sun. You’ll lose it in the Sun’s glare for most of the year, but it will return to view in the middle of August.Mars: look low in the morning sky, Mars moves eastward.
Jupiter: Jupiter is always located very far away from the sun.
Saturn: look low in the Libra constellation to see this bright planet.

, The planets may have an apparition period but may earlier in the eastern hemisphere and later in the night in the western hemisphere. When you look at the apparition periods, take into consideration what part of the earth you’re on.

, The apparition period is the time that your planet is visible. It can last anywhere from a few weeks to almost two years. You can look these up in most astronomy catalogues to figure out when your planets are visible.

, Most of the planets are most visible as the sky gets dark (dusk) or as the sky begins to brighten again (dawn). However, looking for them in the night sky is also possible. You have to look very late at night, when it is incredibly dark out., Combine their apparition period with the time that they are most visible to determine when will be the best time to see the planet you’re looking for.


Mercury: this planet is visible multiple times a year. This year, it will still be visible in September and December.
Mars: the early morning sky will showcase Mars. Starting in August, Mars will begin to climb higher into to sky and continue through the rest of the year. It will become brighter as it climbs.Jupiter: pre-dawn skies are the best time to see Jupiter. It will appear in the 2015 sky in mid-September and continue for months inside the borders of Leo.Saturn: look in the evening twilight sky for Saturn. Saturn will appear in the night sky in November and will be visible in the morning sky by the year’s end."

Choose the right time to see the Eta (η) Aquarid meteor shower.,
Find a suitable location.,
Look into the sky.",How to Find the Eta Aquarid Meteor Shower," The best viewing time is 5-6 May each year.Although Comet Halley won't be visiting Earth until 2061, this meteor shower is courtesy of the Earth passing through its debris cloud.The best viewing time is in the hour or two before dawn.This means around 3:00am to 5:30am.
The Eta (η) Aquarid meteor shower is active from 19th April through to 28th May, but activity is considerably lessened either side of the peak time.;
, You will need to get away from city and town lights and go to a suitable viewing place, preferably higher up (a hill is good). While it is possible to see the showers in both hemispheres, the further south you're located, the more likely you are to see of the meteors.The closer you are to the equator, the better.The naked eye is best for seeing meteors, so don't worry about a telescope or binoculars.
Prepare well for your stargazing, especially by dressing warmly and having something comfortable to recline on. See How to stargaze the relaxed way for tips on equipping yourself for the cooler night air.

, The meteors appear to be coming from a point near the star Eta (η) Aquarii in the constellation Aquarius.However, if you look in that direction, the meteors may well seem stub-like because their tails trail back toward the radiant. For the best chances, keep an eye on the sky generally and in particular eastward, as meteors can appear anywhere in the sky.Expect their trails to point back to the Aquarius constellation.


Expect to be able to see around 30 meteors an hour, with up to twice as many obvious in the southern latitudes.They will be fast-moving (66km a second or 148,000 miles per hour)."

Saturn is visible for at least part of every year when Earth passes between Saturn and the Sun.Depending on the time of year and the relation of our planets, Saturn may be easier or more difficult to locate in the night sky.;
, If you want to locate Saturn, it would be difficult to just point your telescope into the sky and start blindly sweeping around. You have to know where to look, as well as what to look for. Consult a star chart that displays the path of Saturn and pick a time that it will be nearest a recognizable constellation.Starting in 2014, Saturn can be seen close to the constellation Libra, moving on later that year to Scorpius. In may of 2015, Saturn will retrograde, meaning it will move from East to West, back toward Libra. This would be a prime viewing opportunity to find Saturn.
Over the next ten years, Saturn will move steadily East in the sky of the Northern hemisphere, toward Capricornus.
During a period of 2017, Saturn will become invisible to stargazers from Earth, as it will be too close to the Sun for us to see it.

, The opposition refers to the projected point at which Saturn will be closest to the Earth and brightest in the sky. This occurs roughly once every 378 days. During its oppositional period, Saturn will be due South in the Northern hemisphere and due North in the Southern hemisphere, most visible around midnight, local time. Oppositional dates from 2014-2022 are:


May 10, 2014
May 23, 2015
June 3, 2016
June 15, 2017
June 27, 2018
July 9, 2019
July 20, 2020
August 2, 2021
August 14, 2022

, When you've gotten a sense of Saturn's path, you'll first need to locate a constellation to use as a focal point to start scanning from. Basically, you want to familiarize yourself with the constellation its closest to and then use a chart of Saturn's position to find out exactly where to look in relation to that star.


In 2014, that constellation will be Libra, while in January of 2016, it will be directly North of the Antares star in the constellation Scorpius. You can look at Saturn's path here: http://www.nakedeyeplanets.com/saturn.htm

If you're viewing on an oppositional date, aim your telescope due South.

, Typically, Saturn will appear to have a yellowish-golden hue and won't twinkle like stars do. Because Saturn is a planet, it may not be as bright or instantly noticeable as some stars, because it doesn't shimmer. Use your constellation as a point of reference and look for a color difference.

, While Saturn itself is visible with the naked eye, it's a shame to try to find it and not be able to enjoy its distinctive rings, which are visible with a basic telescope. Using a telescope will make the job much easier, as Saturn will appear to be a distinctly different shape than other bodies in the sky.


If you've got a powerful telescope with a yellow filter, that can help isolate the particular light in Saturn's spectrum, making it easier and more pleasurable to see., The planet will be darkened with shadow from the rings, giving an almost 3-dimensional appearance and an oblong quality when seen through a telescope.

, If you've got a good enough telescope to see the rings, you'll notice that they'll look flat, but create a more rounded and marble-like quality to the planet itself. You should also be able to distinguish between the A (outside) and B (inside) ring belts on the planet, which are pretty much the coolest thing in the sky., Aside from its famous rings, Saturn is also notable for the presences of its many moons, which are often visible in the foreground of the planet if the viewing conditions are right and you've got a powerful enough telescope. There's even an app for that., You don't have to be looking for anything in particular to get started, but it helps to develop some familiarity with basic constellations and star charts.

, If you live in an urban environment, it's important to get away from light pollution that keeps much of the night sky invisible to even halfway decent telescopes or binoculars. Find a good viewing location or join other amateur astronomers in your town to get tips about trips or clubs you might hook up with.

, There's nothing more frustrating than getting your gear together, checking over all your charts, packing the hot cocoa and then--poof--the clouds roll in. Make sure you've picked a night with good weather and a relatively clear sky. Keep abreast of the weather patterns during the time of year you hope to find constellations or planets.

, Binoculars are an easy way to get started as an amateur astronomer. If you don't have access to a telescope, use any old pair of binoculars. They're user-friendly and often just as good as cheaper telescopes.


Once you've gotten comfortable finding things in the night sky and you want to up the ante a bit, consider investing in a good quality telescope for viewing. Consider splitting the cost of a good one with some other astronomers and sharing the use of it.
To view Saturn, a basic telescope would be more than sufficient for the beginner. If you want to get fancy, though, NexStar features telescope in the $800 range that locate objects in the sky for you by programming them in, while a professional 11-inch Schmidt Cassegrain runs in the neighborhood of $1,200. Get something to match your budget and commitment.

, Astronomers are an enthusiastic bunch, usually excited to share their knowledge. There's no substitute for learning from the experts, especially if you're interested in finding an object in the sky with as many variables as Saturn.


Look at their calendar and plan on making a visit during a particularly ripe viewing period for whatever you're interested in seeing, then use the techniques and advice they offer in your future stargazing sessions.
If you want to make a pilgrimage, Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles is probably the most famous observatory in America, while the Yerkes Observatory in Wisconsin and the McDonald Observatory in West Texas also offer equally stunning options in other regions of the country.

Start by finding Orion.,

Go from the leftmost star in Orion's belt and up through Bellatrix (the star across from Betelgeuse).
,

Continue in the same direction until you reach a V of stars.,

This V of stars is the core of the Taurus constellation.,

Zoom in on the V shape with binoculars.,
Take some time to look around the cluster.,
Grab a telescope and look at the Hyades.",How to Find the Hyades Star Cluster," Orion is very big and obvious, so it makes a good starting point.
,, The bottom-left star in the V should be bright and red. This is Aldebaran. Be careful - if you reach the Pleiades, you've gone too far!, It is also the Hyades cluster. Aldebaran isn't actually part of the cluster - it's closer, in between Earth and the Hyades., Without binoculars, you should be able to see the five main stars in the V, maybe a few more. With binoculars, the whole cluster jumps into view. When I tried it, I counted over 50 stars that I could only see with binoculars., You'll notice that the stars of the Hyades are relatively dim, and blue-white in colour. This is one of the first hints that Aldebaran, a bright, red star, is not a part of the cluster., One of the first things that you should notice through a telescope is that, unlike the Pleiades, the Hyades has little to no nebulosity. This indicates that it is an older cluster, and all of the star-forming material has been used up."
"
Check your latitude.,
Find an appropriate time of year.,
Search for the times that the Messier objects will appear on that night.

,
Create an observation plan.,
Find a dark site.,
Get to the dark site and get set up before sunset.,
Get a computerised telescope (optional).,
Take photos of each object, if desired.",How to Do a Messier Marathon," The northernmost Messier object is at almost 70 degrees declination, meaning that you have to be north of 20 degrees south latitude. The southernmost is at -35 degrees declination, so you have to be south of 55 degrees north latitude. The best point is around 25 degrees north latitude.;
, To see all the objects in one night, you have to pick a night around the spring equinox. Pick a night where there is a new moon if possible, or a thin crescent if not.

,, Basically, what order you will look at them in, and how long you will spend on each one. You'll want to start with the ones that are only in the sky for a few minutes after the sun has set, and finish with the ones that rise a couple of minutes before the sun.

, You'll want somewhere away from cities, and you'll want somewhere elevated, so that objects on the horizon don't block your view. The top of a big hill would be pretty good.

, You'll be looking for the objects as soon as the sun sets, so you don't want to be faffing around with your telescope in the dark. Get there early, get set up, then relax until sunset.

, That way, you don't have to swivel it around yourself: just enter the next target and let the telescope do the work.

, Use a camera that will time and date each photo, so that you have proof that you did it all in one night.

Look through a database.,
Choose a warm, arid climate.,
Get permission to search the area.,
Buy or make a meteorite stick.,
Get a good metal detector.,
Bring a GPS.,
Be prepared to dig.,
Test the rock for magnetic properties.,
Observe the density of the rock.,
Look for common meteorite traits.,
Do a streak test.",How to Find a Meteorite," Scientists and meteorite enthusiasts keep up to date records of where they find meteorites. You can look online for databases, such as the Meteoritical Society’s database, that show the areas that produce the most meteorite discoveries. Pinpointing the nearest “hot spot” for meteorites is a great start to finding your own., Moisture and damp climates will deteriorate a meteorite relatively quickly. Your best shot at finding an intact meteorite is to look in a place that stays hot and dry. Deserts are one of the best climates to search. Dried up lake beds are great, too.For example, the more meteorites have been found in the Sahara than any other place on Earth.

, Before you take off scouring the Earth in search of meteorites, take a moment to think about who owns the land you are searching. If the land is owned privately, you will need to owner’s permission before searching it. Public lands follow different rules depending on the particular jurisdiction, but you always need permission to search any public lands.If it is privately owned land, you need the permission of the land owner.
If the land is publicly owned (e.g. a park) you need permission the governing body to search it, and permission the keep the meteorite if you find it. Some areas classify them as artifacts, meaning that they belong to the municipality rather than the discoverer.

, While the name might suggest something exotic, a meteorite stick is a simple stick with a magnet at the end of it. You can stick the end to rocks on the ground to test for magnetic properties. If a rock has magnetic properties, then there’s a chance that it could be a meteorite and warrants further investigation.The stick also doubles as a way to swat away things like snakes.

, You should get a metal detector that is made to search for gold. These are the most accurate metal detectors. Go to the location that you intend to search and run the coil of the metal detector along the ground to scan for meteorites underneath the surface.Good, used metal detectors generally cost between $250 and $400. There is no need to buy a new one for a higher price.
The metal detector is more sensitive than a meteorite stick, but less convenient to use. You should keep both with you.

, A GPS will serve you in two ways. First, it will help you keep track of your position in case you get lost. Second, it allows you to mark the location of any meteorites that you find.If you do find a meteorite, marking its location is important. This allows you to upload it to the meteorite databases and help map the location of meteorites.

, Sometimes, you can find meteorites just lying on the ground. Other times, your metal detector will pick up a signal from something deep in the ground. Bring along a pickaxe and a spade to help you dig up any potential meteorites., Testing the rock for magnetic properties can be done rather quickly. Just hold a magnet near the rock to determine if there is any interaction. This can even be done with the magnet at the tip of your meteorite stick. Most meteorites have magnetic properties.Keep in mind that some terrestrial rocks also have magnetic properties.

, Because of their high iron and nickel content, meteorites are rather dense. They are often denser than most terrestrial rocks. This can be loosely translated to being heavier than other rocks their size. Pick up the rock and analyze how heavy it feels versus what you would expect a rock that size to feel like., While not all meteorites share the same characteristics, there are some common traits that can be found in most of them. If you can identify one or more of these traits, there’s a good chance that you have a found a meteorite. Four specific traits to look for are:A metallic shine on the surface of the rock
Small rounded pieces of stones on the surface (these are known as chondrules)
A black or brown coating known as fusion crust (this is produced by the extreme heat of flying through the atmosphere)
Small dents covering the surface of the rock (this is regmaglypt texture or thumbprints)

, Try dragging the rock in question across a streak plate or a piece of paper. If it leaves a streak, it is probably a terrestrial rock. If it doesn’t leave a streak, it might be a meteorite."

Get your supplies.,
Tie the fishing line around the hula hoop.,
Prepare your planets and Sun.,
Attach the planets and Sun to the hoop.,
Hang your planetary mobile.",How to Create a Solar System1," You'll need a hula hoop, fishing line, lightweight balls in various sizes to be the planets and Sun (the smaller they are, the more realistic the distances will be), paint to customize the balls, and tape.


You can use lots of different items to be the planets. You can make them out of foam, styrofoam, papier mache, toy balls, clay, yarn, or any other material you can access.






Just try to make sure that the balls are as light as possible, as the hoop might not be able to hold heavy items.





;
, You will be tying 4 sections of fishing line around the hula hoop. Begin at one side of the hoop and cross directly over to the other, looping around the edges and tying the ends of the line at the center. The line should be taut. Do this until the 4 sections of string split the hoop like a pie or cake.

, Paint your planets or otherwise make them look how you want them to look. Remember to pay attention to the different sizes and colors of the real planets!

, Cut 9 equal lengths of fishing line to however long you want the Sun and planets to hang. Tape or glue one end of the string to each of the planets and Sun, and then tie the other end of the string to each of the 8 sections of fishing line on the hoop. The Sun gets tied at the center, where all the lines meet up. Adjust the planets so that they are closer or further away from the sun.

, Tie a loop of fishing line to the center of the strings so that it can hang or find another way to hang your solar system. Enjoy! You are now done!

Prepare your planets and Sun.,
Make a base.,
Attach your Sun.,
Create the wire arms.,
Attach your planets.",How to Create a Solar System2," You'll need a large foam or styrofoam ball to be your Sun. Get smaller items, like marbles or painted balls of paper or clay to be your planets. Paint them as necessary to make them look like the planets.

, Get some thick gauge wire or a wooden dowel and a styrofoam cone/half sphere/other good base. Stick the wire or dowel into the base, leaving enough of the wire exposed at the top to go at least halfway into your sun with an extra 1"" remaining between the top of the base and the bottom of the sun. Then, glue the styrofoam to a wooden or other heavy flat surface that you can use as a base.

, Stick the Sun onto the dowel or wire, being careful to leave the extra 1"" of space available below.

, Take some long wire that is thick enough to hold its shape but malleable enough that you can bend it with tools like pliers. Wrap one end of each of 8 wires around the extra space below the Sun, and bend up the ends in an L shape in order to give you a spot to place each one of your planets. Adjust the arm's length and height to keep the planets in their correct order and line.


The planets should be placed so that the furthest is on the lowest arm and the closest on the highest arm.







, Once all of the arms are attached, attach the planets to the arms using glue or tape. Enjoy your solar system model with fully orbiting planets!

Determine the star's colour.,
Put a number after the letter to show precise temperature.",How to Classify Stars1," Colour serves as a rough guide to temperature. Currently, there are ten colours, each with an associated temperature range. O class stars are blue/UV. B class are blue-white, A class white, F yellow-white, G yellow, K orange and M red. The other three classes are infrared. L class appear very deep red in visual light. Their spectra show alkali metals and metal hydrides. T class are cooler than L class. Their spectra show methane. Y class are the coolest of all, and apply only to brown dwarves. Their spectra are different to T and L class, but there is no definite definition.;
, Within each colour, there are ten temperature bands, 0-9, with 0 being hottest. Thus, A0 is hotter than A5, which is hotter than A9, which is hotter than F0 (as an example)

"
"
Determine the star's size.",How to Classify Stars2," A roman numeral, indicating the star's size, is added after the temperature designation. 0 or Ia+ indicates a hypergiant  star. Ia, Iab  and Ib represent supergiants  (bright, medium, dim). II is bright giants, III giants, IV sub-giants, V main sequence stars (the part of a stars life that it spends the most time going through) and VI is sub-dwarfs. A prefix of D indicates a white dwarf star. Examples: DA7 (white dwarf), F5Ia+ (yellow hypergiant), G2V (yellow main-sequence star). The Sun is G2V.

"
Use a prism to split the star's light.,
Compare the star's spectrum to a database.",How to Classify Stars3," This will give you a range of colours, called a spectrum, like what you get when you shine a torch through a prism. The spectrum of a star should have dark lines on it. These are absorption lines.

, A good astronomical database should give a typical spectrum for each star type. This is why the type is, sometimes called the spectral class.

Determine the proportion of metals (elements other than hydrogen and helium) in a star.,
Keep your eyes open for stars with no metals.",How to Classify Stars4," Stars with greater than 1% metals are termed metal-rich, and are part of something called Population I. Stars with about 0.1% metals are termed metal-poor, and are part of Population II. Population II stars formed earlier in the universe, when less metals had been formed.

, These stars (Population III) are expected to have been born just after the Big Bang, when the only elements were hydrogen and helium, and metals did not exist. As of yet, these stars are only theoretical, but people are looking very hard for them.

"
"
Determine if the star is variable.,
Determine if it is an eclipsing binary.,
Determine the amplitude and period of the variation.",How to Classify Stars5," Not all stars are, but some are, and can be very useful.

, Eclipsing binaries, like Algol in Perseus, are two stars orbiting each other.

, Compare these to the characteristics of known variable types to determine the type of variable star. For example, Cepheid variables have periods of days to months and amplitudes of up to 2 magnitudes, whereas Delta Scuti  variables have periods of less than 8 hours, and amplitudes of less than 0.9 magnitudes.

Understand how long a year is.,
Look at how long your year is.,
Choose a base date.,
Calculate the ""month number"".,
Find the day and year.,
Put these values into the formula.",How to Calculate Stardates1," There are 1000 stardate units in one Earth year.;
, 365 days normally, 366 for a leap year. This number is called n.

, The base date will determine all of your other calculations. There are two base dates that you can use: 2005 = 58000.00 and 2323 = 00000.00 The standard year (2005 or 2323) is now called b and the stardate year (58000.00 or 00000.00) is called c.

, This number shall be called m. Here's a list: January = 0; February = 31. For all other months, add one if it is a leap year. March = 59; April = 90; May = 120; June = 151; July = 181; August = 212; September = 243; October = 273; November = 304; December = 334.

, The day in the month is called d, and the year is called y. So, using 2005 as the base date, 23 May 2008 has these values: n = 366; b = 2005; c = 58000.00; m = 121 (120, +1 for leap year); d = 23; y = 2008.

, The stardate formula is this: c + (1000*(y-b)) + ((1000/n)*(m + d -1)) = Stardate. Using the above values, the stardate works out to be 61390.71. Stardates are usually quoted to two decimal places.

"
"
Know the base date that has been used.,
To calculate the year, look at the thousands (and above) digits.,
From this number, subtract the stardate base date, divide by 1000, and then add the common base date.,
Determine if it's a leap year.,
To calculate month and day, look at the hundreds digit, and the lower digits.,
Multiply by 365 (366 for leap years).,
Divide by a thousand, then round to the nearest whole number.,
Add one.,
Determine the largest month number that can be subtracted from this number.,
Subtract the month number to get the date.",How to Calculate Stardates2," As an example, lets look at the stardate from the last method, 61390.71. The base date is 2005 = 58000.00

, Ignore the hundreds and tens (and units and decimals). In this example, you get 61000.

, 61000-58000 = 3000. 3000/1000 = 3. 2005 + 3 = 2008. This is the year.

, A year that divides by four but not 100 is a leap year. A year that divides by four and 100 but not 400 is not a leap year. A year that divides by four, 100 and 400 (e.g. 2000) is a leap year. 2008 will divide by four but not 100, so it is a leap year.

, Ignore the thousands and anything higher. You get 390.71.

, When you multiply 390.71 by 366, you get 142,999.86.

, 142,999.86/1000 = 142.99986. Round up to 143.

, You get 144.

, This number will be the month. Remember to add one to the month number if it's a leap year (and after February). The largest month number that goes into 144 is 121, so the month is May.

, 144-121 = 23. So your date is 23 May 2008. That's correct, it's the day you started with.

Decide between an angled spotting scope and a straight spotting scope.,
Choose a waterproof scope if you are outdoors a lot.,
Consider the weight of the scope.,
Set a budget.,
Look for a folded light path.,
Look for magnesium fluoride coating on the lens surface.,
Buy a scope with a larger exit pupil for a brighter image.,
Find a scope with extended eye relief, especially if you wear glasses.,
Make sure you buy a scope with a large field of view if you are using it to watch birds and wildlife.,
Look for a spotting scope with appropriate magnification and lens size.,
Buy your spotting scope at any outdoor retailer that carries scopes, binoculars and other outfitting items for bird watchers, hunters and wildlife enthusiasts.,
Shop online for a larger selection of spotting scopes, and more competitive prices.,
Ask about the return policy and warranty.",How to Buy a Spotting Scope," Many users prefer a straight scope, where the eyepieces are parallel. In an angled scope, the eyepiece is offset at 45 degrees or 90 degrees from the scope barrel.


Buy a straight scope if you will be watching birds from cars, or you plan to keep the scope setting at your height. With a straight scope, your eyes will stay level with the object you are looking at through the lens.






Buy an angled scope if you want to use different heights. You can use an angled scope to look down or up at things without adjusting the height of the scope.





;
, Waterproof or weatherproof scopes are necessary if you use the spotting scope outdoors in different types of weather. Some come with rubber armor for protection. Keeping the lens protected from rain is necessary to prevent condensation damaging your visibility.

, If you will be traveling with the spotting scope or carrying it around in the field, choose something lightweight.

, Spotting scopes can cost from $200 to $2,000. The more expensive scopes often provide a higher optical performance.

, This is an optical setup that combines mirrors and lenses to form a total scope length that is shorter than the actual focal length of the scope. The light performance will provide a long focal length and keep the design compact.

, This will prevent light loss and reduce glare from reflection. The more coating on the lens, the brighter the image will appear. You will also have less eyestrain.

, The column of light that comes out of the spotting scope is defined as an exit pupil. The exit pupil gets smaller when the magnification is higher, giving you a dimmer image.

, Eye relief is the distance you can hold a spotting scope away from your eye while still getting a full view.

, The field of view refers to the width of the circular viewing field in the spotting scope. A wider field of view will give you an advantage if you are watching animals or sights that move quickly.

, Measurements are read by looking at the 2 numbers, which have an ""x"" separating them. As an example, a measurement might read 45 x 60.


Find the magnification, or power, of the spotting scope, by looking at the first number of the measurement. With a 45 x 60 spotting scope, the object you are viewing looks 45 times closer than it would without the scope.
Find the lens size by looking at the second number in the measurement. In the 45 x 60 measurement, the 60 represents the diameter available on the front lens. This is a larger than average measurement, which will allow additional light into the spotting scope, resulting in an image that is brighter.

, They can also be found at sporting goods stores.

, Spotting Scopes can be found at major online retailers like Amazon.


Read customer reviews of models you are considering. They will often point out the advantages and challenges of different scopes.







, Make sure you are protected if your scope does not work properly, or you want to exchange it for a different one.

Ask yourself how much you’re willing to spend.,
Decide what you want to buy.,
Think about what kind of star you want.,
Consider the person you are naming the star for.,
Select your service.,
Choose your package.,
Pick a name for your star.,
Place your order.,
Choose the occasion.,
Receive your shipment.",How to Buy a Star," Star naming services do not actually provide officially-recognized star names.Since you will not actually own the star, you should think carefully about how much the novelty factor of “buying” the star is worth to you.


Since the star-naming processes available to the public confer no official naming rights, you might choose to forego the star-selling service altogether. It’s easy to name a random star yourself and print out a certificate of ownership on your home computer.You’d save money and still get the joy of possessing or giving a certificate bearing a star name of your choosing.;
, Depending on the star-selling service you select, you could buy an entire star system, a binary star (two stars orbiting one another), or a star confirmed to have an orbiting planet in addition to naming just a single star. Each will be offered at different prices.

, There are many different types of stars in the universe, including (but not limited to) red dwarfs, red giants, blue giants, and neutron stars.


Red dwarfs are the most common type of star in our galaxy. They are red and cool.Neutron stars are born from supernova explosions and have extremely fast rates of rotation.Red giants are huge dying stars with temperatures only about half as hot as the sun.Blue giants are rare but extremely bright, on average 60,000 times brighter than the sun., Try to match the qualities of the person you are purchasing the star for to an appropriate star. For instance, if someone’s favorite color is red, you might want to buy them a red giant or red dwarf. Alternately, you might buy a star located in the zodiac sign corresponding to the individual’s birth month.

, There are a growing number of star-selling services available, including the International Star Registry, Name a Star, and Online Star Registry. Each offers unique packages and products when you name your star.


The level of quality each service provides varies. Research your chosen service thoroughly before moving forward.
Businesses dominate the star-selling marketplace. Pale Blue Dot, however, is one star-selling service operated as a nonprofit. Proceeds go to fund scientific research, though your star will still not be officially renamed., All the star-selling services provide you the chance to name your star and get a personalized, matted certificate with your star’s customized name on it. But some services offer more. Other potential options include:


star charts
engraved zodiac pendants
stickers
apps
keychains
online access to live telescope streams
an option to launch your star name and message into space, You can choose any name you want for the star; name it after yourself, your loved one, your favorite band, or anything else you desire. The star's name may not be changed once it's decided. Be as creative as you want when choosing the name.

, Fill out the necessary paperwork. You'll need to include the name of the star as well as your name, address and billing information.


If there are special spellings in your designated star name, make sure they are clearly indicated.
If you have special directions for your star purchase that you want reflected in the final certificate (for instance, a star named in memoriam), indicate them on the order form.
If you know the coordinates of a specific star you want to have named, contact the company to see if it’s available. Try your coordinates with different companies, since each has its own database of available, unnamed stars.

, If you’re buying a star for a loved one, you’ll want to maximize the romance by carefully picking the time and place you unveil your gift. Typically, you’ll want to give him or her the star certificate and related materials on an anniversary, Valentine’s Day, or a birthday.

, Once you order your package, the certificate, astrological chart, and whatever else you chose to purchase will arrive in the mail.


If you named the star after a friend or loved one, be sure to surprise them at an appropriate time with the gift.
If you named the star for yourself, share it with your friends and family. They will surely be curious and impressed.
If possible, find your star in the night sky with a telescope. Online virtual telescopes like SkyView are great for locating stars with specific coordinates. For something more robust, you could download the program Cartes du Ciel, a virtual star chart. "

Consider the challenges first.,
Do well at school if you're starting at this point.,
Look for a suitable college or university course.,
Select suitable degree subjects.,
Spend time polishing up your computing skills.,
Make astronomy your passion.,
Work out which area of astronomy you'd like to dedicate your career work to.",How to Become an Astronomer," Astronomy is a popular field and there is intense competition within it. Moreover, there are not a lot of jobs available, and many of them will be in academia.This means that you'll need to be prepared to study very hard, to focus yourself early on the areas you're willing to work in, and to also consider work in related but not necessarily pure astronomical work. However, if you don't give it your best, you won't know your chances, so don't let the challenges stall you before you begin!


Be prepared to set aside the time and resources to become as qualified an astronomer as possible. This will usually mean getting postgraduate qualifications on top of your initial degree, adding more time to your overall studies.;
, This means top grades in your final year(s) examination results. Focus in particular on mathematics, physics, and other science subjects, as these are the bedrock of astronomy. In addition, knowing foreign languages, computer science and geography can be helpful. Other skills that it's important to have as an astronomer include:


Be analytical, logical, and have sound reasoning skills., Degrees focused only on astronomy as a first-degree course are not common, so you may have to consider moving from where you live, or even applying to an overseas university. Alternatively, speak to the university about the astronomy options that it does offer and work out whether taking courses in mathematics and/or physics with some astronomy input will be sufficient to enable you to later pursue postgraduate studies in astronomy alone. Talk to the course advisers for more information.


Whatever your choice, it is important to aim for the best possible university or college that your school results enable.

, If you're able to get into a pure astronomy degree, then it's likely that the appropriate subjects will already have been sorted out by the course coordinators. If not, then do a mathematics or physics degree. If possible, add astronomy and/or astrophysics if offered but these can be picked up with higher degrees if need be. Whatever you end up studying, do very well in it.


By the time of your postgraduate work, be willing to challenge tradition and the status quo. A great astronomer (who sadly died young), Beatrice Tinsley, is known as one of the greatest creative theoreticians in astronomy and was renowned for her breadth and ability to synergize a great deal of information and see many linkages. Her thesis took 8 years before it was truly accepted because she was so forward thinking in what she discovered but she didn't let this deter her. Be strong in your convictions (and factual bases) about seeing connections and theories others can't.

, This doesn't mean playing games; it means actual programming skills and understanding the mathematical principles that go into programming.

, Even if you're not able to study astronomy as part of your first degree, this is no reason for neglecting to learn as much about it as possible. Read widely in the field, join a local astronomy society and involve yourself in its activities, and take trips to observatories and science museums. As well, try to meet with real astronomers to talk to them about their jobs. You never know, you might also be able to find vacation work doing mundane but crucial things to help astronomy projects in different parts of the world, so be sure to ask and to keep eye on online astronomy forums for any possibilities that might come up.


Look for part-time or vacation positions at university observatories during your semester breaks, even if you're working the till at the entrance. It's all a foot in the door for the keen astronomer.

, As you become more and more specialized through your astronomy studies and experience, you'll need to choose the area of greatest interest to you. Generally, astronomers will specialize in such fields as planetary science, solar astronomy, the origin and evolution of stars, and the formation of galaxies.Even with specialization, there is no such thing as a ""typical day"" for an astronomer, as work can vary broadly including looking through telescopes, using computers to model theories, doing research, talking to other astronomers, educating the public, visiting other observatories, analyzing data, and attending meetings or conferences."

, It's the one between Epsilon and Gamma. The one between Gamma and Aldebaran is Theta. You don't want Theta.

, Hundreds of other stars should appear in the vicinity. This is the Hyades star cluster. It can be pretty confusing, but keep looking at Delta and you'll be OK. Using a telescope is good because it's easier to focus on one spot.

, T Tauri is embedded in a nebula (NGC 1555) called Hind's variable nebula, so look for the star in a fuzzy patch.

, This nebula, catalogued as NGC 1554, is near to T Tauri, both physically and in the sky. However, since it's first observation (by Otto Wilhelm von Struve), it has disappeared, earning it the name Struve's lost nebula. Perhaps it's disappeared, perhaps it never existed.

Make sure your viewing location is as dark as possible.,
Consider your comfort.,
Bring the right viewing equipment.,
Know where to look.,
Consider recording what you see.",How to Watch a Meteor Shower," Both the time and the location of meteor showers are predictable. Look online for a meteor calendar to find out what meteor showers will be happening in your area in the near future.A meteor shower always appears from the same point in the sky, which is known as the ""radiant"". The meteor shower usually gets its name from the constellation that contains that radiant.
Meteor showers happen year-round, with the month of November being the most active time. You can see a meteor in the night sky at any time, but if you want the best chance of seeing one (or many) plan your outing around a meteor calendar.
The table above outlines the major meteor showers in the northern hemisphere region. Peak dates change slightly from year to year.;
, Before you set off to view the next meteor shower that will be happening near you, check a lunar calendar to figure out what phase the moon will be in on that night. If the moon is too bright, you may not be able to see any meteors.Avoid attempting to view meteors during the moon's full or gibbous phases.
The best time for viewing is when the moon is between new and first quarter, as this is when it casts the least amount of light and sets before midnight.

, In addition to checking the lunar calendar, you will need to check the weather forecast for the evening that you plan to view a meteor shower. Poor weather can easily put a damper on your meteor-viewing experience.The best conditions for watching meteor showers are dry and clear. If it is very cloudy, you may not be able to see any meteors.
If it is raining or snowing, you will not only have a low chance of seeing any meteors, but you will also be extremely uncomfortable sitting outside.

, If the moon phase and weather conditions are both favorable for viewing a meteor shower, you will need to know exactly when to plan your meteor-viewing outing. Meteor shower typically peak between midnight and dawn, so you will have to plan on being up during the wee hours of the night.Take a long nap during the day if you plan to stay outside watching for more than an hour or so.
Set an alarm if you plan to sleep. You don't want to miss out on the opportunity to view a meteor shower because you overslept.

, You need an unobstructed view of the sky to properly view a meteor shower. Do your best to find a spot with no buildings or trees.Parks make excellent viewing locations as long as there aren't too many trees.
Try scouting out locations a few days prior to the meteor shower. This will help ensure that you have a prime viewing location.

, Light from buildings, cars, and streetlights can make it much more difficult to see meteors. Get as far away from all sources of artificial light as you can for the best viewing experience.If you live in the city, you may have to travel farther to find a suitable viewing location. The more regular stars you can see in the night sky in a given location, the better that spot will be for viewing meteors.

, If you want to see a meteor shower, you will be sitting outside for a good amount of time, so it's important to keep your basic comfort in mind. Watching the meteor shower will be much more enjoyable if you are well-prepared and have everything you need.


It can get quite cold outside depending on the time of year and where you're located, so don't neglect to dress warmly. It's also a good idea to take blankets and warm drinks with you for cold-weather viewing.No matter what time of year you plan on watching the meteor shower during, consider bringing a reclining chair. This will be much more comfortable than sitting with your neck craned towards the sky.You may also want to bring some snacks and have a late-night picnic while you're star gazing.

, Most meteor showers can be seen easily with the naked eye, so you really don't need to worry about having fancy equipment. You can bring binoculars and telescopes if you like, but be aware that these will limit the scope of your view. This means you may be less likely to see meteors if you use them, although you'll definitely get a closer look if you're lucky enough to spot one.It is a good idea to bring a red-tinted flashlight, as this will help you see where you are going without disrupting your natural night vision., When looking for the showers, always look toward the radiant. A constellation chart can help you identify where the radiant should be for each meteor shower. Remember that the shower is typically named after the radiant constellation.Relax your eyes instead of staring intently at the constellation. This will help you see a larger area, so you will be more likely to notice meteors in your peripheral vision.

, Many astronomers enjoy recording what they see while watching a meteor shower. You can do this in one of several ways, depending on your own personal preferences.You may want to simply tally the number of meteors you see using a pen and paper. You can count shower meteors (those that originate from the radiant, or the constellation after which the meteor shower was named) and non-shower meteors (those that originate in other locations) separately. If you plan on writing this down, you will definitely need to use a red-tinted flashlight to help you see.
If you don't want to have to worry about writing anything down while you're star gazing, take a recording device with you and simply dictate what you see. You can write it all down later if you wish.
If you have a digital camera with a good lens, you can use it to photograph meteors, although it's a good idea to read up on astro-photography first.

Choose a good spot.,
Go to your viewing spot during the early morning hours (between midnight and dawn).,
Find the Orion constellation.,
Look for the radiant.",How to Watch the Orionids Meteor Shower," In 2012, the best time to spot these meteors in is October 21, 2012, before dawn., Check the moon phase to see if its brightness might interfere with seeing the meteors. In 2012, waxing crescent moon setting before midnight will create a dark sky ripe for meteor watching.If the weather is going to be cloudy in your area, though, you might be out of luck. If it's only cloudy on the peak night, you can try watching the meteors on other nights between the 17th and the 25th., The further you get away from city lights, the better you'll be able to see the meteors. In the Northern Hemisphere, you'll want a spot where you have a clear view in an east/southeast direction (no trees or tall buildings on the horizon). In the Southern Hemisphere, you'll need to look in the east/northeast direction., That's the best time to spot meteors because Earth moves into the debris field as it rotates into sunlight., The easiest thing to spot might be Orion's belt, a group of three stars in a straight line. Envision this belt as the ""waist"" of an hourglass. In the Northern Hemisphere, the hourglass will lean to the left. In the Southern Hemisphere, it'll lean to the right. To test yourself, try finding the Orion constellation in the introduction image of this article.


, The radiant is the central point from which the meteors will emanate. In the Northern Hemisphere, it'll be just left of the hourglass, as if the upper left hand star is pointing to it. In the Southern Hemisphere, it'll be below the hourglass, as if the lower right corner is pointing to it. (These approximations are given for mid-hemisphere latitudes; the orientation will vary slightly depending on how far you are away from that latitude.)"

Set your alarm clock.,
Pack a blanket, compass, bug spray, and snacks.,
Find a spot away from city lights.,
Look towards the northeastern sky.,
View the sky with your unaided vision.,
Look for the constellation Perseus.,
Bring along a tripod if you want to take photographs.",How to Watch the Perseid Meteor Shower," Go out to watch at midnight or later. The pre-dawn hours are usually the best for viewing because the side of the Earth facing the sun allows more meteors to be visible., Mittens or gloves and a warm hat are also a good idea for those who feel the cold at night.


Bring a reclining chair if you don't fancy lying on the ground or holding your head tilted back all night.

, Planning a camping trip at this time is a great option.

, If you are unsure of your orientation, use your compass or an app to get your bearings and determine which direction is northeast.

, The meteors can be seen using the naked eye.

For closer views, use binoculars or a camera with a telescopic lens. You don't have to use these to appreciate the meteors, however, and these can limit your field of vision, causing you to miss the ongoing show if you don't know where to look.

, The stars of Perseus form somewhat of a ""Y"" or ""V"" shape and the meteors will seem to shoot outwards from a central point in this constellation. They will be visible, however, all over the sky.


Perseus can be found by following the bottom left star in Cassiopeia (the W constellation) down and to the left. There is a double cluster that appears the meteor shower is coming from.

, The tripod is important to provide stability during long exposures and limit the camera movement when you take the photos.


Put the camera focus on ""infinity"" and use an open shutter over a period of minutes if your camera has this capability.

Visit your eclipse viewing site in advance.",How to View an Eclipse," Solar eclipses occur when the sun, the moon, and the Earth are all in alignment allowing the moon to block the sunlight from reaching the Earth.Solar eclipses are observed as a total or partial eclipse, depending on whether or not you're located in the ""umbra"", the place where the moon's shadow hits a small point of Earth, or the ""penumbra"", the part outside of the umbra.


The amount of time a total eclipse lasts can be from a few seconds to a maximum of seven and half minutes, as the umbra moves along the ""path of totality"". There is also an ""annular eclipse"" when the moon slides across the sun, but doesn't completely cover it.Total solar eclipses are possible because the sun is 400 times further away from Earth than the moon and 400 times larger than the moon, allowing the sun and moon to appear to be almost the same size from our perspective of the sky.;
, Also be prepared to inform any other people you're responsible for to ensure their safety. You shouldn't look at eclipses through binoculars, telescopes, any type of glasses, sunglasses, smoked glass, polarizing filters, or exposed color film – none of these methods are strong enough to protect your eyes.Although the light wavelengths visible to the human eye are blocked by these objects, it is the non-visible light that causes damage to the eye; the ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths still get through and cause just as much damage as the visible light.

, A homemade eclipse viewer or pinhole viewer is very simply done and, generally speaking, it is the easiest and safest way to view an eclipse for just the price of some thick poster paper or cardstock. Its drawback is the very small image it produces, but this one is ideal for children and young teens who will enjoy the process of preparing the pinhole projector and then using it.Poke a small hole using a pin or thumbtack through the center of a piece of cardstock. Place a second piece of paper on the ground to serve as the screen you will be projecting the eclipse onto.
Standing with your back to the sun, hold the card a few feet off the ground above your shoulder or to your side. Make sure your head is not covering up the hole. It should be held in the direction of the sun and you should be facing the screen you placed on the ground.
When the projector is properly aligned, you should see a perfect circle on the other piece of card you placed on the ground. The circle may appear fuzzy at the edges. You can bring it into sharper focus by moving the pinhole projector closer or further away from the ground.
When the eclipse takes place, that circle will shrink and turn into a crescent, if it is a partial eclipse. If it is a total eclipse, then it will turn into a thin-lined O.
You can also use a pinhole camera for eclipse viewing.

, If you choose to look at the sun with your eyes (rather than by projecting the sun onto something else), then you must always have a solar filter between you and the eclipse. While it is possible to view a total solar eclipse without protection during totality, only an experienced observer will know when to judge this moment accurately and when it is essential to immediately place the filter between your eyes and the eclipse again: before the sun reappears.Since most eclipses are partial and most observers are novices, it is much safer to only look at the eclipse through a solar filter; even the briefest flash of sunlight can damage your eyesight, so even 99.9 percent of coverage of the sun is dangerous. Solar filters are available for all viewing equipment (camera, binoculars, and telescope).
When selecting a solar filter for a telescope or binoculars, it is absolutely vital that you choose a filter made for your exact model and brand. If the filter does not fit properly, or is used incorrectly, permanent eye damage can occur.

, Projection of the eclipse image through binoculars or a telescope is another safe method to view the eclipse indirectly. However, it is only safe if you use it for projection, not for looking through – do NOT look through the binoculars or telescope doing the projecting!Cover the front objective lens of one side of the binoculars with a piece of cardboard or a lens cap.
With your back to the sun, hold the binoculars with one hand and aim them towards the eclipse so that the uncovered lens picks up the eclipse. Use the shadow of the binoculars to help you align the binoculars.
Watch the image projected back onto a screen, wall, or large piece of white paper that you're holding in your free hand. It should be situated about one foot from the binocular’s eyepiece. Just move the binoculars around until the eclipse image appears on the card, screen, or wall. The further you hold the card away from the eyepiece, the larger the image will be.
When you get used to using this method, try fixing the binoculars to something like a tripod or propping them up against a chair or table. The image will benefit from the increased steadiness.
If you're using this method to observe the sun during a non-eclipse time, shift the binoculars away from the sun every minute to prevent overheating of the equipment. Let the optical equipment cool down for a few minutes before trying again.

, Shade number 14 (or higher) welder's glass is one of the most affordable and widely available filters you can use to observe the sun with unaided eyes. The glass must completely cover your eyes at all times of observation.Such a filter can also be added to the front of your binocular objectives. Again, all of the lens must be covered and if it can only cover one lens, cap the other one.

, There are special types of filters that can be purchased that mount directly onto a telescope or pair of binoculars. While some of these can get quite expensive, there are cheaper versions that will still protect your eyes and allow you to view the sun. There are several important warnings you must take heed of when purchasing and mounting a solar filter:You must be absolutely sure that the filter is a proper solar filter, as ordinary photographic filters will not filter the dangerous rays.
The filter must fit your brand and type of equipment perfectly. Always buy the filter from a reputable dealer; if you have any concerns about the safety of the filter, do not use it and if you need advice, take it to your local planetarium or astronomy club for expert advice.
Check for surface damage prior to mounting. Mylar is easy to puncture or rip and if that has happened, the filter cannot be used.
Be sure that the filter is secure once on; if you need to tape it as well as mount it to ensure that it won't come off or loosen, then do so.
Do not use filters that screw into the eyepiece end of binoculars or telescopes. The focused light can burn through or crack the filter at this end owing to the intense heat of the sun being concentrated; just the tiniest crack or separation in the filter can permanently damage your eyes. Only use filters that mount onto the front end of the telescope.

, Lunar eclipses occur less frequently than total eclipses of the sun, with a lunar eclipse taking place about twice a year, and a total lunar eclipse happening on average every two to three years. A lunar eclipse occurs when the full moon travels into the Earth's shadow and becomes a coppery or dull-red color (a ""Blood Moon"").Total lunar eclipses can last for up to an hour and forty minutes, although a lunar eclipse can last for up to six hours when adding in the time taken to pass through the penumbral region.
Like solar eclipses, there are total and partial lunar eclipses that depend on the alignment of the Earth, the sun, and the moon.

, A lunar eclipse occurs only during a full moon when it is perfectly aligned with the Earth and the sun. The eclipse happens because the Earth casts a shadow on the moon. Lunar eclipses usually occur late at night over a period of hours as the moon passes in and out of the shadow cast by the Earth. If you want to see the whole thing, you will have to stay up late.The night must be clear and fairly cloud-free for optimal viewing.

, Lunar eclipses are perfectly safe to observe with your eyes and without a filter. You don’t need any special viewing equipment because you are not looking directly into the sun, you’re actually viewing a projection of the sun onto the moon.Because there is no risk of damage to your eyes from the sun, no special equipment is required.To get a more impressive view of the eclipse, you can look at it through binoculars or a telescope.
If you'd like to photograph the lunar eclipse, read How to Photograph the Moon for more details on moon photography.

, Given you'll be viewing at night, the air will probably be colder, so dress warmly and perhaps take along a thermos of something warm to drink. Bring along something comfortable to sit on, as the eclipse will last for over an hour.

, It's hard to view eclipses when you're not aware they're happening! One of the best ways of knowing when eclipses will happen is to use the internet and follow updates on reputable sites. In addition, some good astronomy books and periodicals will also keep you updated about forthcoming eclipses. Some of the sites worth keeping an eye on include:


NASA Eclipse website here: this has both solar and lunar eclipse details. See also, NASA eclipse path maps through 2020 and through 2040.
Some of your favorite science and astronomy information websites and blogs might update you about upcoming eclipses as they're about to happen.

, Some weather elements will make it hard to see an eclipse, such as clouds or a storm. If it's clear, you're all set to watch! Use this weather forecast to dress appropriately for the eclipse. If it’s winter and you’ll be watching a lunar eclipse, you’ll want to bundle up to stay warm., If it's your own backyard, you'll already be familiar with it, but if you want to go somewhere with a clearer view, check it out before the eclipse. See what the terrain is like, where you can park your car, whether it's likely to be popular with other people, etc. There are actually some key things to look for when selecting a good eclipse-viewing spot:View: Choose a spot with a good view of the horizon to enable you to see approaching and departing shadows.
Comfort: Are there restrooms, refreshments, shade options, etc?
Accessibility: Is it easy to reach, easy to park, easy to walk around, and so forth?
Familiarity: Is it likely to attract busloads of tourists? If there is ease of access for buses, bus parking, and you've seen the site getting buzz on Twitter and Facebook, you might want to find somewhere less well-known and therefore less likely to be crowded! If you know someone who has a farm, ranch, or quiet, open property in the vicinity of the eclipse, consider asking them if they mind you turning up to watch the eclipse.

Learn when the moon rises and sets.",How to Tell Whether the Moon Is Waxing or Waning," The moon revolves around the Earth, and as it does, we see different angles of the moon’s illuminated surface. The moon doesn’t create its own light, but rather shines when it reflects the sun’s light. As the moon transitions from new to full and back to new again, it goes through several phases, marked by its recognizable crescent and gibbous (""bulging"") shapes, which are created by the moon’s own shadow.The moon phases are:


New moon
Waxing crescent
First quarter
Waxing gibbous
Full moon
Waning Gibbous
Third quarter
Waning crescent
New moon;
, The moon travels the same path around the Earth every month, so it goes through the same monthly phases. The phases exist because from our perspective on Earth, we observe the illuminated portion of the moon differently as it makes its way around us. Remember that half the moon is always illuminated by the sun: it’s our vantage point on Earth that changes and determines what phase we see.During the new moon, the moon is between the Earth and the sun, and is therefore not illuminated at all from our perspective. At this time, the moon’s illuminated side completely faces the sun, and we see the side that’s in full shadow.
During the first quarter, we see half of the moon’s illuminated side and half of the moon’s shadowed side. The same is true in the third quarter, except the sides we see are reversed.When the moon appears full, we see its full illuminated half, while the side that’s in complete shadow faces out into space.
After the full moon, the moon continues its journey back to its original position between the Earth and the sun, which is another new moon.
It takes the moon a little over 27.32 days to complete one full revolution around the Earth. However, a full lunar month (from new moon to new moon) is 29.5 days, because that’s how long it takes the moon to return to its position between the sun and Earth., On the moon’s journey from new moon to full moon, we see a growing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called the waxing phase (waxing means growing or increasing). As the moon then goes from full to new again, we see a diminishing portion of its illuminated half, and this is called waning, which means decreasing in strength or intensity.


The moon’s phases always look the same, so although the moon itself may appear in different locations and orientations in the sky, you’ll always be able to identify what phase it’s in if you know what to look for.

, Different parts of the moon are illuminated during waxing and waning. In the Northern Hemisphere, the part of the moon that is illuminated will appear to grow from right to left until it’s full, and it will then diminish from right to left.


A waxing moon will be illuminated on the right side, and a waning moon will be illuminated on the left side.Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waxing moon (increasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the ""C"" curve then it is waning (decreasing).

, During the first quarter, the moon will look like a D. When it’s full, it will look like an O. And when it’s in the third quarter, it will look like a C.


A crescent moon in the shape of a backwards C is waxing
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a D is waxing.
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waning.
A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waning.

, The moon doesn’t always rise and set at the same time, but changes depending on what phase it’s in. This means you can use the time of moonrise and moonset to determine if the moon is waxing or waning.


You can’t see a new moon because it isn’t illuminated by the sun, and because it rises and sets at the same time as the sun.
As the waxing moon moves into its first quarter, it will rise in the morning, reach its height around dusk, and set around midnight.
Full moons come up when the sun goes down and set when the sun comes up.
As the waning moon moves into its third quarter, it will rise at midnight and set in the morning., In opposition to the moon in the Northern Hemisphere, the moon in the Southern Hemisphere will illuminate from left to right, become full, and then diminish from left to right.


A moon that’s illuminated on the left side is waxing, while a moon that’s illuminated on the right side is waning.Hold out your right hand with your thumb out, palm facing the sky. The thumb and forefingers make a curve like a backward C. If the moon fits in this curve, it's a waning moon (decreasing). If you do the same with your left hand and the moon fits in the ""C"" curve then it is waxing (increasing).

,


A crescent moon in the shape of a C is waxing
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a backwards D is waxing.
A moon in the shape of an O is full.
A half or gibbous moon in the shape of a D is waning.
A crescent moon in the shape of a backwards C is waning.

, Although the moon may illuminate in the opposite direction in the Southern Hemisphere versus the Northern, it will still rise and set at the same times during the same phases.


The first-quarter moon will rise in the morning and set around midnight.
The full moon rises and sets when the sun sets and rises.
The third-quarter moon will rise at midnight and set in the morning."

Good astronomy books will provide you with an overview of the history of astronomical observation, a description of the solar system and its planets and moons, descriptions of what constellations can be seen at any given time, and pictures of stars, nebulas, comets, globular clusters, and galaxies.


You can find books for purchase at bookstores and on Internet sites such as Amazon.com. Your local library also offers a number of books on the subject that you can check out for free.
When selecting astronomy books, look for the most recent copyright dates you can find, ideally within the last 5 years. The pace of astronomical discovery makes a lot of information, such as the planetary status and presumed size of Pluto, outdated.;
, Magazines such as ""Astronomy,"" ""Astronomy Now,"" or ""Sky and Telescope"" feature articles on recent astronomical discoveries and reviews of new books and software applications for computers and smartphones. They also offer lists of Internet websites devoted to astronomy and offer tips for the beginning astronomer; one magazine, ""Night Sky,"" introduced in 2004, is even devoted to the new amateur astronomer.

, A number of astronomy-related organizations, such as the Astronomical League and the Society for Popular Astronomy, have their own websites to disseminate information about astronomy in general as well as the specifics of their organizations. NASA also has a number of astronomy-related offerings, such as the Astronomy Picture of the Day and astronomy education resources for both students and teachers. Many amateur astronomers have their own websites, where they discuss astronomy in general and post their observations.


The Internet also is a good source of astronomy freeware and shareware. You'll want at least a planetarium program, and depending on your astronomical interests, a program that tracks the planets' positions in the solar system and one that reports the moon phase for a given date.

, Sites such as Google Groups, MSN Groups, and Yahoo! Groups feature a number of astronomy discussion groups covering astronomy in general or specific aspects such as astrophotography, cosmology, exoplanets, or meteor showers. Most groups let you post messages and participate in discussions either by email or on the forum itself.

, Planetariums display images of the night sky on a semicircular dome. Some planetarium shows are designed for the astronomy novice, while other shows are oriented to amateur astronomers strongly interested in a particular subject, and still others are designed so that visitors can set up their own programs from a selection of shows. Planetariums can be found on college campuses and in science museums.

, Some astronomical observatories have nights open to the general public. These provide the opportunity to see an astronomical object through a telescope larger than that available to the average astronomy hobbyist.

, Local astronomy clubs give you the chance to meet with other amateur astronomy hobbyists face-to-face and learn from one another. These clubs, separately or with other clubs, organize star parties and sunspot viewing sessions and have regular presentations on various astronomical topics. These clubs oversee astronomy viewing programs, such as viewing the objects listed in the Messier catalog, and award certificates to amateur astronomers motivated enough to complete them. Some clubs maintain their own observing sites and keep a collection of telescopes that can be checked out to members.

, Many science fiction fans are also astronomy buffs, and so many of the conventions they put on include astronomy panel presentations and displays. You can check sources such as ""Locus"" or ""The Science Fiction Chronicle"" for a list of conventions and then search the websites for the conventions near you to see if they have an astronomy programming track. Many convention websites also feature links to other conventions' websites, so if the first convention whose site you visit doesn't mention anything for the amateur astronomer, visit other sites until you find what you're looking for.

, You don't need to have an expensive telescope to observe the night sky; it's possible to see the Andromeda Galaxy, 2.2 million light years away, with the naked eye if the sky is sufficiently dark and you're well away from city lights. A telescope simply makes it possible to see dimmer objects better than you can see them with the naked eye. You'll find these items helpful to get first and have with you before you buy a telescope:


A good-quality field guide. Some field guides have laminated pages to prevent them from being damaged by spills, dew, or rain.
A planisphere. This is a device that displays a printed image of the night sky with markings at the edges for the month and day of the year and the time of night. Simply align the viewing area with the correct day and time, and you'll see what stars and constellations should be visible at your location.
A red flashlight. You can cover the lens of a regular flashlight with red cellophane, or you can buy a flashlight with a red bulb or LED. You can use either a handheld flashlight or one that is worn over the shoulders or on the forehead.

, Your best observing will be on dark, clear nights when the moon is low in the sky or new and when you are well away from city lights. If you live out in the country, your backyard would be a suitable location, as would a park on the outskirts of the city.


If it isn't possible to get out of the city very often, you can start your observations with the objects you can see best, such as the moon, major constellations, and the planets.

, Although there are 88 constellations altogether, certain constellations, parts of constellations, and the stars in them can help you find other constellations, depending on the season and time of night.


The Big Dipper, part of the Northern Hemisphere constellation Ursa Major, can be used to find a number of stars and constellations. The stars Merak and Dubhe on the outer edge of its ""bowl"" can be used to find the North Star, Polaris, by going in the direction the Dipper opens, and the star Regulus in the constellation Leo by going in the direction of the bowl base. Following the stars in the Dipper's handle in an arc leads to the star Arcturus in the constellation Bootes and then to the star Spica in the constellation Virgo.
The bright stars Vega in the constellation Lyra, Altair in the constellation Aquila, and Deneb in the constellation Cygnus, form what is known in the Northern Hemisphere as the Summer Triangle. Deneb and the other 2 stars that form the swan's body in Cygnus point to the star Antares in the constellation Scorpio.
Three of the stars in the constellation Pegasus, Algenib, Markab, and Scheat, and the star Alpheratz in the constellation Andromeda form the Great Square of Pegasus, visible during fall in the Northern Hemisphere. Algenib and Alpheratz, along with the star Caph in the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia, can be used to find Polaris during times when the Big Dipper is below the horizon.
The constellation Orion has a roughly hourglass shape and is visible from late fall to early spring in the Northern Hemisphere. The stars in its belt can be used to point downward toward the star Sirius or upward to the Pleiades in the constellation Taurus.
In the Southern Hemisphere, the 2 brightest stars in the constellation Centaurus can be used to point to the Southern Cross.

, Binoculars are lighter in weight and give a wider field of view than does a telescope, and unlike a telescope, they present their view right-side-up instead of inverted. A good 7 x 35 binoculars should be sufficient to see lunar craters, the phases of Venus, the largest moons of Jupiter, the Pleiades, and the Great Nebula in Orion.


Some larger pairs of binoculars intended for astronomical use require a tripod to stabilize them.

, After you've done a fair amount of naked-eye astronomy and observing the sky with binoculars, you can consider getting a telescope. You'll want to spend time reading advertisements and reviews in magazines and online and, if you belong to an astronomy club with a telescope library, trying out various telescopes to help you determine what features you do and don't need. A good telescope should have a combination of the following features:


A sturdy, smooth-operating mount.
High-quality optics. Look for a telescope advertised as having ""diffraction-limited"" optics.
A large aperture (opening). The larger the aperture, the larger the telescope, however, and larger telescopes can be bulky, heavy, or both.
Be easy to set up and tear down.
Some telescopes come equipped with onboard computer systems that direct built-in motors to point the telescope to any object in their databases. These features can be useful if you like to look at a number of objects during a viewing session, but they add significantly to the telescope's cost. They can supplement, but should not replace, your ability to find astronomical objects by yourself.

Research the moon phases.,
Find out the peak night for the shower.,
Choose the darkest hours.,
Pick a dark location.",How to Watch the Leonids Meteor Shower1," It is important to know what phase the moon is each night of the Leonids shower. The natural light from the moon can obstruct your view so that smaller meteors are undetectable and even bigger ones appear dim. Try to choose a night during the shower that the moon is in the new moon phase, or as close as possible.A full moon is the worst time to try and watch the Leonids meteor shower.;
, The shower usually peaks around November 17th. Consult an astronomy website or news source to confirm the peak date for this year. Assuming that the moon isn’t full or nearly full on this night, it will be the best time to watch the shower.The next major Leonids outburst is scheduled for 2033. These outbursts are when the show is most impressive to watch., From midnight to dawn are the best hours to watch the Leonids meteor shower. During these hours, the sky is at its darkest. This makes it easier to see the meteors because there is less light interference., Try to get out and away from cities. You want to find a place with as little light as possible and a good view of the sky. Keep your eye turned to the darkest part of the sky, and avoid looking at any lights (including a cell phone). You should also give your eyes fifteen minutes or more to adjust to the low light.You could watch the shower from a mountain top or a clearing in the forest with a good view of the sky.

Bring a lawn chair.,
Cover yourself up.,
Bring some drinks and snacks.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Watch the Leonids Meteor Shower2," It can take a long time to spot meteors. Bring a lawn chair or some other outside furniture to lay back on. This will help you be comfortable while you wait to catch a glimpse of the Leonids meteor shower., Being out all night in mid-November might get cold. Be sure to pack a blanket or sleeping bag to cover yourself up. Building a fire for heat will produce too much light and prevent you from seeing the shower., Most skywatchers take a break every hour or so. This gives you a chance to stretch your legs and refuel. Bring some coffee or tea and a few snacks to keep you in it for the long haul. You will have to travel away from city lights and the convenience of just going to the kitchen for a snack., If you can't make it out to watch the Leonids meteor shower, you can stream it online. Some astronomy websites, like space.com, stream the shower. This makes it easy for anyone who can't get away from the city (or don't want to) to watch the Leonids meteor shower."
"
Record your observations.,
Keep track of your breaks.,
Filter your flashlight.",How to Watch the Leonids Meteor Shower3," Many amateur and professional astronomers will keep a journal of their observations. For simple note keeping, just record the time and approximate location in the sky each time you see a meteor. You can use constellations as markers to help you record the location of each meteor., You won’t have your eyes on the sky the entire night. You’ll have coffee breaks and snack breaks. You might even fall asleep at some point in the night. Keeping track of these times helps you know how long you were actually looking at the sky and how many meteors you saw (and how many you may have missed).If you are taking notes by hand, you should even record the time that you look down to take notes. You might be surprised at how much time this can be over the course of an entire night.

, You will need some light to function outside in the dark. You should use a dim flashlight to provide this light. Covering the flashlight with a red filter will dim it even further and reduce the impact it has on your ability to see the meteor shower."

Cut a one inch square in a cardboard box.,
Cover the square.,
Make a small hole.",How to Make a Simple Solar Viewer1," Cut into the short side of a cardboard box. This way, the light shining through the hole can travel the length of the box to the other side. Letting the light travel the length of the box will enlarge the image. You should use a box that is no less than six feet long to produce a clear, viewable image.If you do not have a cardboard box that is six feet long, you can cut smaller pieces of cardboard and tape or glue them together to make a box that is the appropriate length.;
, Tape a piece of aluminum foil to cover the box. Aluminum foil will block excess light from shining through the hole you created. Be sure that the foil is pulled tight so that it is smooth., Use a toothpick or a needle to prick a hole in the center of the aluminum. This will allow just a small amount of light to be focused through the hole and projected at the other end of the box. This will provide an image of the the sun that is safe to look at."
"
Tape up your screen.,
Aim the pinhole at the sun.,
View the sun.",How to Make a Simple Solar Viewer2," To improve the quality of your image, you can project it on a white screen. The easiest way to do this is to take blank white paper and tape it up at the end of the viewer (furthest from the hole). One sheet of paper is sufficient., In order for your viewer to capture the an image of the sun, you have to aim it. Avoid looking at the sun to aim the viewer. Instead, point the viewer in the general direction of the sun and then move it around slowly until you see the sun on your screen., Once you have the sun on your screen, it is safe to look at. You do not need any safety glasses or other special equipment. The image is much less intense than actually looking at the sun."
"
Be safe.,
Watch for patterns.,
Brush up on your math skills.,
Find other ways to watch the sun.",How to Make a Simple Solar Viewer3," You should never look directly at the sun. Even doing so briefly can damage your eyes. You have to use a solar viewer to project the image or buy special glasses and/or telescopes that filter out enough light to be safe.Sunglasses will NOT protect your eyes from the sun. Only special filtered lenses will be safe.

, If you are serious about studying the sun, you can watch for patterns. Look for sunspots in your image (they will show up as dimmer spots on in the image). Observe the sun spots over time and see how they move.To make accurate comparisons, you should observe the sun from the same place every time.

, You can use some basic measurements of your image and viewer to find interesting facts about the sun. This is because the image you are viewing is a scaled down image of the sun. Even though it’s smaller, it is proportional to the actual sun.For example, you can find the diameter of the sun by following these steps:

Divide the diameter of the image by the distance from the pinhole (the length of the box).
Multiply that answer by the distance between the earth and sun (approximately 150,000,000 kilometers or 93,000,000 miles)



, You can watch the sun without a specially made solar viewer. Find a tree or other object that provides shade. If there are any holes or spaces in the object, you will see spots of sun shine through. You can also hold your hands up and allow the sunlight to shine through the spaces between your fingers. For optimal viewing, put white paper or cardboard under whatever you are using to view the sunlight.

Read about astronomy.,
Visit a planetarium or observatory.,
Purchase a star atlas or a star map which will enable you to determine what you are looking at while gazing at the sky.,

Join the Astronomical League or similar organization.,
Enjoy your new hobby.",How to Get Started in Amateur Astronomy," Merely looking up in the sky will not teach you all you need to know, so visit your local library and browse through the astronomy section. There are a variety of books which are geared toward beginners as well as the more advanced. Find one that is an introduction to astronomy, and learn about the physics of the cosmos. Surf the Internet under 'Astronomy' and be assured you will receive a vast array of information as well as pictures.;
, Many observatories have huge, expensive telescopes and offer you an exciting as well as informative way of observing the many wonders of the sky. Check with your local science museum to see if they offer a star-gazing night open to the public. Visit the observatory at night, climb up to the tower, and observe first hand, through their powerful telescopes, what you have learned and seen up until now only in books. A planetarium uses projectors to offer an artificial view of the night sky. The chairs recline, the room becomes black, and all you see are stars in a darkened sky. This is a great way to get started because you will have access to an expert guide to answer your questions. You also will get to meet others with similar interests.

, Your library will probably have one, but since maps will be an important part of your astronomical study, it is best to buy your own. If you are unable to afford one, then download free star maps from the Internet.

, Good choices might include national and state parks. Inquire at these places about naturalist lead presentations about the night sky as well. Use your eyes. It is not necessary to buy an expensive telescope because the naked eye can see a great deal in the night sky. By observing with only your eyes you get a true feeling of how ancient astronomers practiced their craft. If you can, try to lie down on the grass and look at the sky above you. The darkened sky takes on another dimension in this position, and creates a feeling of you being totally alone in a vast universe. Locate the North Star, and follow the 'map of the sky'. Make sure you have the correct star map to coincide with the date and location. If you have studied the books, you might be able to find the ""Little Dipper"" and other constellations or asterisms.

, If your naked-eye observations have gotten you excited about astronomy, get a good set of binoculars and observe the night sky with them for a more close-up view. 10x50 binoculars are excellent for stargazing.

, There are several types of telescopes, with different features, uses and prices. However, you need not purchase the most expensive one in order to enjoy astronomy. The most important thing to consider is the telescope’s aperture, or the size of the light-gathering part of the telescope. The larger the aperture, the brighter your image will be. The next most important characteristic is the focal length of the 'scope, which will determine how much of the sky you can see in the image. Magnification is much less important than quality of optics. A good way to choose a telescope is to attend star parties (see below) and ask a few of the members for permission to try theirs so you get an idea of which models you prefer.

, Amateur astronomy is very popular in most cities and small towns. Search the Internet to find a club in your vicinity or get information by calling a local planetarium. For clubs in the U.S.A., go to http://www.nightskynetwork.org, a website dedicated to amateur astronomy which will help you locate clubs and events. Clubs give you the opportunity to learn from others who have more experience, and to meet and make new friends with other beginners who have the same interest in astronomy.

, Star parties are outdoor meetings where amateur astronomers meet and look at the sky together. Many are already members of an astronomy club. This can be quite interesting, especially since each person might find a new area, star or planet that you might have overlooked.

, There are a number of periodicals which cater to amateur astronomers. Among the most popular are Sky and Telescope and Astronomy. These magazines provide monthly calendars, a wealth of sky watching tips, amazing pictures, and up-to-date information on new products and discoveries.

, They are free and you can search for them in iTunes and many other podcast directories.

, Membership in these large astronomy organizations will give you the opportunity to network with other astronomers and to participate in observing programs. The Astronomical League has observing programs for every age, skill, and equipment level, and by participating in a program and submitting your observation log, you can earn certificates of completion (and a wealth of new knowledge).

, Amateur astronomy can be a lifelong pursuit, and there’s always something new to look at. What’s more, amateur astronomers actually make significant contributions to the study of astronomy, and amateurs have discovered stars, comets, and other phenomena before professionals. In astronomy, you don’t have to be a professional to make a difference.

Watch the weather reports, Forecast the Weather Using Clouds, or log-on NOAA.GOV (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), the authority that meteorologists use, and enter your zip code on the main page.,
Check the phase and rising and setting times of the moon.The light scattered from a bright moon will likely obscure the stars too much for a good stargazing experience.,
Choose a suitable location.,
Focus on staying warm.,
Think safety.,
Consider your bodily comfort.,
Take along the right stargazing equipment.,
Prepare drinks and snacks.,
Give your eyes a time to adjust.",How to Stargaze Comfortably," Find whether the sky is clear enough to do stargazing, also be aware of the temperature and humidity conditions and prepare adequately with the right clothing, equipment, etc.


A forecast for a completely clear, dry night means you'll probably be free of subtle haze. A breeze can mean less pollution near a city, but strong wind can be chilly.;
, But an early setting or late rising moon may make this moot. Even with the moon, you can see bright things like the planets and bigger meteors in a shower.

, You can stargaze anywhere provided the sky is clear and there is little light interference. (Some light from each source scatters throughout the atmosphere to interfere with the stars even if you're looking away from the light source.) It's best to head away from cities and large towns to where it is dark enough. Suitable places tend to be on higher hills (there might be some nearby), mountainous areas and desert-like rural areas.So, you'll need some way of getting to a good spot (bike, car, a lift from someone else). Another benefit of these out-of-the-way locations is that they're usually very relaxing.


Downtown in a big city, you won't see many stars. (If you see only two or three, they're probably planets.)
In suburbs and small cities, you can see constellations.
In rural areas without lights in your field of view, you can see the Milky Way.

, Unless it's a hot summer's night, most outdoor night experiences will come with cool to cold air, and this can put a real dampener on wanting to stay outdoors for too long.


For winter or cold weather, the appropriate wear would include: A coat, hat, boots, mittens or gloves, and layers of warm clothing.For heavy-duty cold weather watching, you may also need thermal underwear, long-sleeved thermal t-shirt, thermal socks, a pouch for warming hands, face mask, insulated boots, and hand and foot warmers.For summer or warmer nights, the appropriate wear would include: A jacket or cardigan, long pants, long sleeved shirt, and possibly layers depending on the night temperature.
It's a good idea to stargaze from home at first, if possible. That gives you plenty of opportunities to rush back into the house to adjust the warmth of your clothing if needed. You can then use this experience for stargazing trips that take you farther afield.

, When you're out and about at night, there are a few things to be careful about when stargazing, to ensure that your experience remains both safe and comfortable:


Your visibility is clearly reduced, so you'll need to have your own source of light. Take along a quality flashlight or a headlight that is able to light up paths, terrain, and show possible snags like tree roots, rocks, etc. if you're heading along a trail to a stargazing spot. You can attach red cellophane to your flashlight to help your eyes adjust better to the darkness or get one that already has a red LED.You can even start this process by wearing sunglasses indoors before leaving, so that there is a gradual reduction of light on your eyes.
Depending on where you are, you might also need to take along bug repellent. Remember that some insects like mosquitoes are night feeders, so you can be at higher risk for some diseases if you're stargazing where such insects tend to be found.
Know the area where you're stargazing. You're somewhat vulnerable laying around staring nerdily at the sky at night, often with conspicuously expensive gadgets, so be sure that the area is safe. If you're not in your own backyard or on your own property, it is wise to be stargazing with someone else.
Take a map if you're headed somewhere you don't normally go to, along hiking trails etc. A guide might also be helpful if you're doing some remote stargazing.
Tell someone what you're doing and where you're headed if you're stargazing away from home. Give an estimated time of arrival back home and take along your cell phone. That way, they can keep an eye for you and can follow you up if you don't come back when you said you would. If you're a minor, always tell a parent or responsible adult what you're doing.
If you're stargazing near a road or parking area, make sure you're far away enough and conspicuous enough not to get run over by a careless driver. Your car should be well away from traffic too, but you might want it between you and the direction from which danger might come.

, You could simply turn your head up to the sky and stare but do that for too long and your neck will protest mightily! The most comfortable way to stargaze is to lie back and watch the heavens unfold before you; and you can also try sitting and looking up. To enable a more comfortable experience, try the following suggestions:


Bring along a folding chair or a reclining lawn chair to sit on. You won't strain your arms if you are stargazing using binoculars, nor your legs from standing too long. You can place a sleeping bag across a lawn chair for both comfort and added warmth.
If you wish to sit or lie down on the grass, put out a lined picnic rug to prevent the cold from the ground seeping up. In addition, over this place a padded mat or a blanket. You can also bring along a cushion and sit on it and maybe a blanket to wrap around you.
If sitting, place your legs out straight. This will let the blood in the veins flow or else your legs will go numb.
Depending on how long you intend to stay outside for, the addition of a propane heater can make your stargazing experience more enjoyable. Be sure to keep it away from the telescope though as the glow and less-dense warm air rising from it (and within your telescope, if that gets warmed too) can distort the view.You'll need to be able to tote your gear with you; get a good day-pack, so that you're not overwhelmed by carrying things.
A reclined front seat in an opened convertible is perfect if you're not using a telescope (the car is on springs, so it would wobble). Turn the car off and put on a blanket to stay warm.

, Some things will make your stargazing experience a lot more enjoyable if you have them, especially if you want to see more of the stars than what the naked eye can see.


Deep-watch the sky using binoculars or a telescope. Do some broad-ranging research on which type of stargazing equipment to sink your money into before buying. You might prefer to borrow a friend's telescope or pair of binoculars and see what you like and don't like first.
Bring along a compass to help you find things in the night sky, including reference stars by which to initially orient a ""go-to"" telescope. Or, better yet, use an automated sky map such as the smartphone application Google Sky Map: the GPS and orientation sensors will automatically choose a map for the direction in which the phone faces.
A star chart or map is a wise choice for stargazers – try to find one that is laminated and that glows in the dark as this will be the easiest one to read and handle.
A suitable camera for astrophotography if you like. It's relatively easy to photograph the moon or star trails.

, Comfort definitely involves staying nourished and some warm drinks like hot cocoa, hot tea or coffee, or other favorite drinks are an ideal addition to your pack. Also take along something to nibble on, like energy or snack bars, some homemade cookies or cake, and perhaps some nuts or chocolate. Trail mix is another good option but be careful not to eat too much as you're not exactly hiking!


If it's a romantic evening, bring along champagne and truffles! Not too much unless you have a designated driver.

, Your eyes need anywhere from five to thirty minutes or so to adjust to the light (or lack of it) in your chosen stargazing spot.Set up your spot and simply relax for a few minutes and hopefully by this time, your eyes should be ready to start stargazing. Start anyway, and expect more stars to come into view as your eyes continue to adjust. Enjoy your stargazing – amateur astronomers have just as much chance, if not more chances, of finding amazing new cosmic discoveries as the professional astronomers due to the time and dedication available.If you find it hard to spot faint stars, try using ""averted vision"". Look just to the side of what you're trying to see. Your peripheral vision is most sensitive to light and dark, making it easier to see faint objects when the rest of the sky appears gray.Consider keeping an observation log of all that you see. This will enable you to make comparisons, find anomalies, and build up a record over time.

Put the date down in your calendar.,
Be in the right location.,
Understand that the principal events occurring during the transit are characterized by contacts.,
Take appropriate eye safety precautions to protect your eyes when viewing the transit.,
Know what to expect.,
Enjoy the sight.",How to Observe the Transit of Venus," It will occur on 5-6 June 2012. Naturally, also hope for cloudless skies and good weather wherever you are! Also, do some research about the transit of Venus.;
, The best viewpoint will be from the Pacific Ocean.The entire transit (all four contacts, see below) is visible from northwestern North America, Hawaii, the western Pacific, northern Asia, Japan, Korea, eastern China, Philippines, eastern Australia, and New Zealand. The Sun sets while the transit is still in progress from most of North America, the Caribbean, and northwest South America. Similarly, the transit is already in progress at sunrise for observers in central Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and eastern Africa. No portion of the transit will be visible from Portugal or southern Spain, western Africa, and the southeastern two thirds of South America.


See http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/transit/venus/city12-1.html for the exact timings for your city or area location around the world.

,


The event begins with contact I which is the instant when the planet's disk is externally tangent with the Sun.
The entire disk of the Venus is first seen at contact II when the planet is internally tangent with the Sun. During the next several hours, Venus gradually traverses the solar disk at a relative angular rate of approximately 4 arc-minutes per hour.
At contact III, the planet reaches the opposite limb and is once again internally tangent with the Sun.
The transit ends at contact IV when the planet's limb is externally tangent to the Sun.
Contacts I and II define the phase called ingress while contacts III and IV are known as egress. Greatest transit is the instant of minimum angular separation between Venus and the Sun as seen from Earth's geocenter.

, Do not look directly at the sun with the naked eye or unprotected binoculars or telescopes; you risk permanently blinding yourself. However, do not be dissuaded by this; proper viewing techniques can permit you to view safely:


Read the NASA guidelines on safe observation of eclipses. These can be found at: http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/safety2.html.
The safest observation method involves projecting the Sun's image through a telescope, binoculars, or pinhole onto a screen.Use a filter approved for safe solar viewing.Approved filters can allow viewing with the naked eye, such as an astronomical solar filter that has a vacuum-deposited layer of chromium, or eclipse viewing glasses like Eclipse Shades or Solar Shades, or Grade 14 (or darker) welder's glass. If wishing to see the transit magnified, you'll need to get an appropriate solar filter for your telescope. The lens must fit properly and not be makeshift. You can also purchase solar binoculars or special telescopes that have in-built hydrogen-alpha filters if preferred.

, Using your approved filter or other safe method of viewing, you will be able to see a small black dot that is about 1/30th the size of the solar disk. It will move across the Sun very slowly., Given it has a 120 year cycle, there will be many people who will never have this opportunity, so grasp it while it's there. Some other things you can do include:


Write a poem, story, or letter about it to be passed down to your grandchildren some day.
Hold a street party to celebrate the event.
Watch webcasts.
Have a ball!

Find an Iridium flare listed (the time listed is 24-hour local time). Write down the date, time, altitude and azimuth.



SKYSAT -- 16-bit graphical satellite prediction program that also indicates possible flares from Iridium and other satellites

IRIDFLAR -- DOS based program

, Flares that are forecast days or weeks in advance might not be accurate, so they might be brighter or dimmer than expected, come earlier or later, be in a slightly different point of sky, or sometimes not appear at all.

, Some TV channels, such as some weather and news channels will list the time to the second. There are also websites that list time accurately, some in UTC and others in local time. The Atomic Clock in Boulder shows all U.S. time zones or UTC.

, See if the sky is clear or at least partially clear, or else you will not be able to see the flare. This will allow you time to gauge the correct place in the sky to watch. Also, you can usually see the satellite as it approaches the 'flare' point, if you're on-site a little early.

, An Iridium flare looks like a star that moves slowly and quickly brightens, then slowly fades away. If it looks elongated, leaves a visible trail, fades away in less than a second from becoming visible, or lasts more than a minute, it is most likely either a meteor, a fireball, or the ISS (International Space Station, which can also be found with similar methods).


Azimuth - Measured clockwise around the observer's horizon from north; north has an azimuth of 0°, east 90°, south 180° and west 270°.
Altitude - Overhead is 90°, directly in front of you is 0°. Determining the correct altitude to watch is a bit more difficult than the azimuth, especially in the twilight before stars begin to appear, which is the usual time satellites are seen. A handy gauge is your fist held at arm's length - it is approximately 10° 'tall'. I prefer to also extend my index (pointer) and pinky fingers straight out (not 'splayed') to provide a better 0° and 10° gauging point. Place your extended pinky on the horizon in front of you, look up to your index finger & note where it is against the sky -- count ""10"". Keep your eyes on that spot, and shift your fist upwards until the pinky is where the index was - then up to the index's new position & count ""20"", & so on. Repeat until you've determined the correct angle - and of course, a 5° (eg, 45° etc) position falls in the middle between the extended fingers. This 'gauge' is pretty accurate. You can continue up to 90° & if that point is directly overhead, you're doing it correctly.

Use the pointer stars on the Big Dipper.,
Locate the tip of the Little Dipper's handle.,
Rely on the arrow in the Cassiopeia constellation.",How to Find the North Star1," You can easily locate the North Star by using the Big Dipper. The Big Dipper contains stars known as ""pointer stars,"" which can be used to locate the North Star.To start, locate the Big Dipper. The Big Dipper is a constellation made up of 7 stars. The constellation is found in the northern sky. In the spring and summer months, the Big Dipper will be somewhat high in the air. In the autumn and winter months, it'll be lower in the sky.The Big Dipper is given its name because it's shaped somewhat like a bowl with a handle. Four stars form a trapezoid-like shape, the bowl portion. Stemming off of these four stars are three more stars, forming the shape of a slightly bent handle.Once you've located the Big Dipper, you can use it to find the North Star. To do so, look at the two bright stars that form the side of the bowl farthest away from the handle's tip. These are the ""pointer stars."" Draw an imaginary line connecting the pointer stars. Extend that line about four or five times the distance between the pointer stars. You should eventually reach a somewhat bright star. This is the North Star.;
, The Little Dipper is the constellation that contains the North Star. The tip of the Little Dipper's handle is the north star. If you're able to locate the Little Dipper, you can easily spot the north star.You can use the Big Dipper to find the Little Dipper. Once you find the Big Dipper, look slightly higher in the sky. The Little Dipper will appear as a mirror image of the Big Dipper. It is also a constellation made up of 7 stars. Four stars form a trapezoid base, and three extend out from this base to form a handle. The last star extending outward is the North Star.If you live in an urban area, it can be difficult to locate the Little Dipper. You may be better off trying another method., Using the Big or Little Dipper are the most common means to locate the North Star. However, if the Big Dipper is low in the sky it can be difficult. Fortunately, you can use the constellation Cassiopeia to locate the North Star.


Cassiopeia is a constellation that consists of 5 stars. They form an ""M"" or ""W"" shape. Cassiopeia is located in the north sky. In earlier hours, the constellation looks more like an ""M."" Between midnight and dawn, the constellation looks more like a ""W."" In the months of February and March, Cassiopeia is especially likely to appear as a ""W.""The three stars that form the middle portion of the ""M"" or ""W"" can be used to locate the North Star. Look at this point as if it were an arrow. Follow the direction of the arrow forward. You should eventually land on a somewhat bright star. This is the North Star."
"
Locate the North Star with your smart phone.,
Invest in a star atlas.,
Plan ahead with your computer.",How to Find the North Star2," There are many smart phone applications that work something like a telescope. You enter your location, or allow the phone to find your location, and then point your phone to the sky. The phone acts as interactive map, identifying stars and constellations for you. Some applications can also enhance visuals, allowing you to see stars more easily.


Sky Guide is an application for iPhones. The app can track your location and time. Then, you can hold your phone up to the sky and it will provide you a map. It can identify different constellations and stars.For an Android, there is an app known as Stellarium Mobile. It works the same as SkyGuide, but with a slightly higher resolution. You can better see stars and constellations through your phone when using Stellarium., Star atlases have been around for a long time. If the idea of carrying your phone around while stargazing kills the fun for you, consider buying a star atlas instead. You should also always take an atlas with you when hiking in the event your phone battery dies. A star atlas is a book that breaks down the night sky by the region and time of year. You can use the graphics and charts provided in a star atlas to locate the North Star on any given night.


Every star atlas is slightly different. There's usually a guide in back that provides information on how constellations are labeled. For example, small stars may be labeled by dots. Major stars, like the North Star, may be marked by large, red dots.A star atlas will provide a map, much like a map of a town or city, guiding you across the night sky on any given night. Select the map for your specific region and time of year and use that map as a guide. Bring a flashlight with you as you go out to stargaze so you can consult the map as needed.Practice using the star atlas before you go camping. It can take awhile to get proficient at using a star atlas. Make sure you get lots of practice so, if you need to find the North Star in a pinch, you're well-prepared to use your atlas., You can use desktop applications for your computer to know how the sky will look on a given night. These devices can help you plan ahead. You'll go outside with a rough idea of where you can expect to find the North Star.


In addition to phone applications, Stellarium also provides a desktop application you can download on your computer to locate the North Star. It's available for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Your background would be the night sky, adjusted for your region and time of year. It will show you what you can expect the night sky to resemble on a given night, locating the North Star for you. You'll know where in the sky to look when you go out.If you have a Mac, PhotoPills is a photography planning application. You can use this if you're planning on photographing the night sky. Based on your location and the time of year, PhotoPills will simulate the galactic arch for you. This will form a map you can use later to locate the North Star."

Figure out which direction is north using two sticks.,
Create a shadow with sticks.,
Pay attention to how moss is growing.",How to Find the North Star3," If you don't know what direction you're facing, finding constellations can be a struggle. This can inhibit your ability to locate the North Star. Determining which direction is north can allow you to locate the North Star more easily. You can use two sticks to do so.


First, find two sticks. One stick should be slightly bigger than the other.Place the sticks in the ground vertically. Place the taller stick slightly ahead of the shorter one.Lie down in front of the sticks. Line up one eye, forming a straight line between your eye and the two sticks. Wait for a star to appear in your line of vision.Stare at the star for a few minutes and wait for it to move. It if it moves up, you're facing east. If it moves down, you're facing west. If it moves right, you're facing south. It if moves left, you're facing north., If it's daytime, you may still be able to see the North Star. However, you'll be unable to rely on constellations as they're very difficult to see during the day. Instead, you can create a shadow with sticks and use that to locate north.


Place a stick in the ground. Take a stone or other object and place it where the end of the stick's shadow falls.Wait about an hour. The shadow will move, either growing shorter or longer. Place another stick at the end of the new shadow. Then, stand at a perpendicular angle to the shadow. You are now facing north., If you're in an area where moss grows, you can use moss to help you locate north. Look for moss on vertical structures, such as trees. Moss requires a damp atmosphere to grow. This means moss usually grows on the north side of vertical structures, as the north side gets less sun."

Use binoculars for your first attempt at finding the Andromeda Galaxy.,
Locate three constellations to get your bearings.,
Look for the distinguishing features.,
Draw a line from the star Sirrah (also known as Alpheratz) on the edge of Pegasus and Andromeda to the star Ruchbah in Cassiopeia.

,
Draw a line from Mirach through mu Andromedae and on through the first line.,
Scan the area just to the southeast of where the lines meet, along the second line, with binoculars (or a small telescope - see next step).,
Use a telescope for a more detailed examination.",How to Find the Andromeda Galaxy," While you don't need to use anything other than your eyes, using binoculars will make it significantly easier for you as a beginner, and binoculars will give you a wider viewing zone than a telescope, which is important for a beginner. Also, choose a cloud-free night, and if you live where the stars are never seen, you'll need to go somewhere else.;
, You need to look for Pegasus, Cassiopeia and Andromeda. Pegasus was the flying horse in Greek mythology, and the end star of Andromeda goes into making the Square of Pegasus; it's easy to find because it's one of the largest geometrical shapes in the night sky.Cassiopeia has a W or M shape which is easy to see and two of its end stars can be used as pointers to the constellation Andromeda.Andromeda was a princess who was rescued from a monster by Perseus in Greek mythology.The chart featured here shows the night sky for 35°N and is set for the 1st of December at 8:00 pm local, but can be used for later in the evening before that date and earlier after.

, Pegasus is one of the easier to locate of the three, as it looks like a giant rectangle; this is the Great Square of Pegasus. Cassiopeia is even easier to locate, looking like a giant ""M"" or ""W"". Andromeda lies between them.

,, Keep in mind that mu Andromedae is dimmer than Mirach.

, You'll notice an oval of faint light. This is the Andromeda Galaxy.

, A typical 20cm (8 inch) reflector telescope will enable you to see 1,000 times further than the Andromeda Galaxy,so you should get a great view with a standard telescope. When using a telescope, and especially in light-polluted skies, also try finding Cassiopeia, then using the ""M"" of Cassiopeia to point toward Mirach. After positioning Mirach in the telescope, move toward Cassiopeia to find the dimmer star, then more in that direction until you come across two fainter stars and a fuzzy object that forms a triangle with these two stars. This is the galaxy.


If you look carefully in binoculars or a telescope, you may find two faint fuzzy spots beside it. One of them, M32, is smaller in size and closer to the actual galaxy core. The other, NGC 205, is more elusive, larger in size, and farther from the actual galaxy. Both are companion galaxies to Andromeda.
You will probably be able to find it if you use a GOTO or computerised telescope. If you use an equatorial and know how to use setting circles, the Galaxy is at RA 00h43m, DEC +41deg16' .
If you're already familiar with using a telescope, you will be aware that its narrower field of vision than binoculars can make the targeting more precise and consequently harder. Thus, if you are a novice in using telescopes, leave this step until you're more confident.

Keep looking!",How to Watch the Draconids Meteor Shower," The dates when the Draconids will be most visible vary from year to year, but are usually sometime in the first couple of weeks of October (usually between the 7th and 9th). A quick Google search will tell you when to be ready during the year that you want to see them.In 2016, the shower is expected to peak on October 8. Because there will be a quarter-moon that night, it may be tough to see the show.
NASA predicts a particularly good display of the meteor shower in 2018.;
, The meteors will be most visible on a night when there will be very few clouds and no rain. If the peak night is a cloudy one, you can consider trying to see the shower on the night before or after, but there’s no guarantee that you’ll see anything., The best place to see the meteor shower will be in a very dark place with lots of open sky away from the lights of cities and suburbs. You may need to drive a little ways out into the country to accomplish this, or you might want to seek out a national or state park if there’s one near you.. Aim for a place with a clear view of the north with no trees or tall buildings on the horizon..There are also a variety of online websites devoted to helping you find a “dark site’ to watch the night sky without obstruction, so check one of those out if you don’t know of a good place., There are dozens of apps (many of them free) that help you locate stars in the night sky, and you can find plenty of maps to help online or in an Astronomy book. You may want to take a look at one in advance. The meteor shower will appear to be coming from the constellation Draco the Dragon, so it may help you to know where to look for it.The Dragon is located between the Big and Little Dipper.If you’re going to use an app, you’ll probably want to check it before you leave home to be sure you can locate the appropriate stars. Looking at your phone a lot in the dark will make it hard for your eyes to adjust well enough to see the stars and meteors.

, You’ll want something comfy to sit or lay on, like blanket or even a sleeping bag. Depending on the weather, you will probably also want lots of warm layers and maybe a thermos of a nice, hot beverage.


You may want a chair if you’re not interested in laying on the ground, but you’ll have to tilt your head back and look straight up unless your chair reclines, so you may want to pack a beach chair. You could also consider laying in the bed of your truck or on the hood of your car.
Don’t bother with binoculars or a telescope. You won’t be able to adjust your focus fast enough to see anything., Many meteor showers are best viewed right before dawn, but you will have better luck seeing the Draconids right as it gets dark. (Aim to be in place right before the sun sets.) , Avoid looking at the screen of your phone or other mobile device for a few minutes before you look at the sky. It takes about thirty minutes for your eyes to completely adjust to the darkness after you’ve been in bright light, so turn off all of your light sources as soon as you arrive.If you need to look at a light, try to do it with one eye closed. Don’t open that eye again until you’re in the darkness. The eye you closed won’t have to readjust., It has 8 stars, but usually only 7 of them will be visible to the naked eye. Look north and search for seven stars that make up a bowl with a handle. On October evenings, the Big Dipper will be very close to the horizon.


If you are anywhere north of the latitude of Little Rock, Arkansas (35 degrees north latitude), you should be able to see it as soon as it gets dark. (If you’re south of that latitude, you may still be able to see some meteors, but you should use the Little Dipper as a reference point.), If you’ve found the Big Dipper, look nearby for the North Star. You can find it by looking at the bowl of the Big Dipper, and tracing a line up from the two stars that make up the outer edge of the bowl. The North Star is the last star in the handle of the Little Dipper.The Little Dipper will be visible at any time of night anywhere north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5 degrees north latitude).
If you can’t find the Big Dipper, you may still be able to find the Little Dipper by looking North and searching for the distinctive bowl and handle shape.

, If you found both Dippers, you probably have a good shot at finding Draco. You’ll need a pretty dark sky.Once you’ve spotted the North Star, look for a long, glittering chain of very faint stars that curls between the North Star and the Big Dipper. Follow the chain upward to find Draco’s two brightest stars, Estanin and Rastaban. , You may have to wait a while. If you can locate Draco the Dragon’s two brightest stars, Estanin and Rastaban, you can often see the meteors emerging from the head of the dragon.You don't have to locate Draco or its brightest stars in order to see the meteors. If you’re not positive you’ve found it, just keep looking in the direction of the Big and Little Dippers, and a meteor will likely catch your eye.
Usually you can see about 10 meteors per hour if it’s a very clear night."

Watch the clouds. Clouds should not glow orange at night. Black clouds, almost like holes, indicate a great sky.
Check the weather forecast for a clear sky and for geomagnetic storms. During solar storms, auroras may come down south, and the air glow may become strikingly intense. If you live near the Northern Lights, solar storms can cause the light show to be spectacular.;

",How to Add Vector Features to an OpenLayers 3 Map," Simply copy the following line of code into your <script></script> element:.




var point_feature = new ol.Feature({ });


;
, To tell OpenLayers where to place the point, you need to create a geometry and give it a set of coordinates, which is an array in the form of . The following code creates this and set's the point's geometry:




var point_geom = new ol.geom.Point(
  );
point_feature.setGeometry(point_geom);




, Line strings are straight lines broken into segments. We create them just like points, but we provide a pair of coordinates for each point of the line string:




var linestring_feature = new ol.Feature({
  geometry: new ol.geom.LineString(
    , , ]
  )
});




, To add the features to the map, you need to add them to a source, which you add to a vector layer, which you can then add to the map:




var vector_layer = new ol.layer.Vector({
  source: new ol.source.Vector({
    features: })
})
map.addLayer(vector_layer);




, We start by putting the features we want to transform together into an array that we can iterative through.




var features = [
  point_feature, 
  linestring_feature
];




, In OpenLayers, we can use the transform() function on the geometry object of each feature. Put this transform code into a function that we can call later:




function transform_geometry(element) {
    var current_projection = new ol.proj.Projection({code: ""EPSG:4326""});
    var new_projection = tile_layer.getSource().getProjection();
 
    element.getGeometry().transform(current_projection, new_projection);
  );
}




, Now simply iterate through the array.




features.forEach(transform_geometry);




, Create a fill style object and a semi-transparent red colour, and a stroke (line) style that is a solid red line:




var fill = new ol.style.Fill({
  color: });
 
var stroke = new ol.style.Stroke({
  color: ,
  width: 1
});




, The OpenLayers style object is quite powerful, but we're only going to set the fill and stroke for now:




var style = new ol.style.Style({
  image: new ol.style.Circle({
    fill: fill,
    stroke: stroke,
    radius: 8
  }),
  fill: fill,
  stroke: stroke
});
vector_layer.setStyle(style);

Expect changes.,

Note warning signs of abuse.",How to Build a Healthy Relationship," Don't expect your partner to be able to read your mind or “figure it out.” If you have a need or want to express something, you need to communicate it yourself.It’s not fair to you or your partner when you don’t communicate your needs. Likewise, don’t hold in the things that bother you. If something is bothering you, say something to your partner.If you don’t know how to start a conversation, say, “There’s something on my mind and I’d like it if you listened.” You can also say, “Something is bothering me and I feel like we should talk about it.”;
, Part of a healthy relationship is knowing when to talk and when to listen. Develop your listening skills by not interrupting and letting your partner finish their thoughts and feelings. Truly listen, and don’t try to come up with a response while your partner is talking.Use active listening skills by reflecting the content and emotions of what your partner is saying. Say, “Let me make sure I understand. I hear you saying that you’re upset that I didn’t tell you what time I would be home, and you wish I would have said something earlier because you were concerned.”, Boundaries are not meant to make you feel trapped; they are created to maintain respect and understand expectations in the relationship.If something makes you feel uncomfortable, bring it up and discuss how things need to change and how each of you will make changes. If one person wants to spend lots of time together and the other does not, it’s important to set a boundary of how much time is appropriate together and apart.


For example, you may want to create sexual boundaries (being sexually exclusive) and social boundaries (having one night a week designated for friends or activities).
Don’t let your partner control you and don’t set out to control your partner. Setting boundaries means respecting each other and finding compromises to make the relationship work well.

, Without clear communication, a relationship can quickly bring out the worst in people. When you have a want or a need, express it to your partner clearly. Don’t beat around the bush or say something you think will please your partner when it makes you unhappy. Try using “I statements” to express your feelings, make an observation, or share your opinion. I statements allow you to express yourself clearly and directly and take responsibility for your own thoughts and feelings while avoiding blame and accusations toward others.To properly communicate, say, “ I think/feel/want…. when….. because….” For example, “I feel upset when you leave the door open because the room gets cold and drafty.”

, Share your thoughts and feelings with your partner and stay open to the feelings that arise. Show interest in your partner’s feelings and support them during stressful situations. Connecting emotionally with your partner allows you to empathize with their experience.If you’re feeling emotionally disconnected from your partner, start asking questions about feelings (and don’t blame or make assumptions). By discovering your partner’s feelings, you may begin to feel more compassion toward them.

, Make time periodically to discuss the relationship. Sometimes changes occur or schedules become busy and you may miss time to connect or talk about things. You may want to bring up relationship goals and expectations, as these can sometimes change. Ignoring difficult topics or hoping they will go away is one way for a relationship to crumble.An example of checking in could be, ""Hey, are you ok after our disagreement yesterday? I just wanted to make sure there weren't any leftover feelings or things we didn't resolve.""
Ask your partner if you are on the same page in terms of relationship expectations. You may discuss moving in together, sexual satisfaction, marriage, children, or plans to move. Be clear on what you want and how your partner fits in with that.

, Relationships can be fun and exciting early on, yet it important to make sure that you and your partner are rooted in respect. Act in ways that demand respect from your partner.Strive to treat each other with respect at all times, even when you are mad at each other.


Your partner’s wishes, thoughts, and feelings have value. Communicate to your partner that you consider the way they feel. Mutual respect is an important part of making a healthy relationship work.Talk to your partner about creating respect in your relationship. Decide “do’s” and “don’ts,” such as name calling or sexual touch.

Take turns speaking
Use time outs with necessary



, A healthy relationship should be one in which you and your partner feel appreciated. Often, relationships are built from many small things added one on top of the other. Find the things your partner does for you and say “thank you.” Instead of focusing on mistakes your partner makes, focus on the ways your partner adds to your life.When you notice something, speak out and show your appreciation.


Ask your partner how they like to feel appreciated. Write a note or a card, or make an effort to say “thank you” often.
Let your partner know how you like to be appreciated. Say, “It means a lot to me when you notice the things I do for you.”

, It’s easy to transition from face-to-face time together to digital communication. Yet, sometimes meanings can get lost in translation or non-verbal communication becomes non-existent. Spending quality time together can help strengthen your relationship and increase the bond you and your partner feel together.Find activities that you can do together regularly. It can be as simple as enjoying a cup of coffee together each morning or reading together at night.
Trying something new together can be a fun and exciting way to spend time together. You don’t have to do anything crazy — even going out to dinner at a new restaurant or trying a new cuisine can be a fun experience.

, No one person can fulfill everything and every role for another person. Let your partner have time with friends and family and engage in hobbies. It’s important for each person to have their own friends and activities that are enjoyed on their own. While you may want to spend every moment together during the beginning of the relationship, respect each other enough to spend time apart and know that time spent apart doesn’t mean anything negative for the relationship. Support your partner in maintaining friendships.Avoid giving up your friends or pressuring your partner to give up friends. It’s important to have friends and the emotional support they provide. Likewise, don’t allow your partner to dictate whether or not you can see your family.

, Know that your relationship will likely change. Allow growth for yourself, your partner, and for the relationship itself. Recognize that changes in your relationship are opportunities for new growth. Change is inevitable, so welcome changes and accept that the relationship will adapt.When changes happen, take a deep breath and deal with them one by one.

, If you’re caught in unhealthy patterns and want to improve them, ask your partner to see a therapist together. A therapist can help you break unhealthy patterns you may feel trapped in, such as yelling, blaming, isolating, making assumptions, and not communicating effectively. It can also help with emotional avoidance, modifying behavior, and changing the views you have of your relationship.Seeing a therapist doesn’t mean your relationship is doomed — it means you’re willing to work together to improve it.

, Dysfunctional behavior in a codependent relationship can look like one person supporting or enabling the other person’s irresponsibility, immaturity, addiction, or poor health. If you are the enabler, you may feel guilty if you don’t help, even if you know it hurts your partner in the long run. Codependency is often rooted in childhood and may involve repressed feelings (not speaking up when you have a need, keeping quiet to avoid a fight) and an inability to say “no.”


You and your partner may isolate from other people and not have friends outside of your relationship.
Educate yourself about codependency and spend some time identifying your (or your partner’s) self-defeating behaviors.You may want to work with an individual or couple’s therapist.
Check out How to Tell if You Are Codependent to learn more.

, Being in a relationship doesn’t mean you have to spend every moment together or share everything. Respect your partner’s need for privacy and space. If jealousy comes up, remind yourself that jealousy is something you feel that may not be directly related to your partner’s actions.


Don’t demand your partner’s passwords to social media accounts or email. Respect your partner’s privacy and be willing to trust your partner.
It’s not healthy for you or your partner to constantly monitor each other’s behaviors. This can be rooted in jealousy or control, which are not healthy components to bring into a relationship.

, Relationships should be built on respect and equality, not power and control. While you may not think much of some behaviors at first, disrespectful behaviors set a tone in a relationship. If your partner is possessive, insulting, yelling, humiliating, or disrespectful in any way, take note. There is no excuse for abuse. Abuse is a choice that an individual makes and you do not have to be the victim.For more information, check out How to Recognize a Potentially Abusive Relationship.

This can make it difficult to initiate or enjoy displays of physical affection, such as caressing, hugging, holding hands or cuddling.Deal with your fears regarding intimacy and connecting physically with another person. Accept that you are afraid, and find out where it’s coming from. It can be helpful to realize that your fears are probably not related to your current partner or events, and to try to move past them.Talk to your partner and let them know that you are uncomfortable and why. Ask him or her to be patient. Showing physical affection can be easier as you get to know someone better and deal with the root causes of your discomfort with physical intimacy. Plus, improving communication may lead to a closer and more affectionate relationship.
Talk to a professional about it. They can help you deal with the negative emotions related to your fears and get over your hesitation to show physical affection. If you don’t want to talk to someone, you can write about it in a journal or express your feelings in other ways.
Make showing physical affection a habit. Hold your partner’s hand, touch their shoulder or give them a hug as often as possible. Eventually, showing affection physically will come easier and more natural.;
, Touching helps relieve stress and pain, can help people cope and strengthen bonds.Put cuddle time on your daily schedule with your family to promote physical and psychological health. Date night, story time and even TV watching time can all be combined with cuddling.

, Whether it is with your partner or your kids, holding hands is quick, painless and can really cement your bond. In fact, it is probably one of the easiest ways to immediately increase the amount of physical affection you show for another person. Whether you are walking to the bus stop, through grocery isles or sitting at home on the couch, reach over and take someone’s hand that you care about.

, Having contact with your kids and partner can release oxytocin, the cuddle hormone, which lowers blood pressure. It can also help you control the stress hormone cortisol.Physical touch activates the orbitofrontal cortex in the brain, which contributes to rewarding feelings and can even boost the immune system., Physical affection is any touch that is meant to boost affectionate feelings or love in the giver or receiver.Write down your list so you can refer to it later. Then, make it a goal to do each method at various points throughout the week.


Some ways that you can show affection include: kissing, back rubs, massages, caressing, cuddling, holding, hugging and holding hands. There may be other methods specific to you or your relationship that can also relay feelings of love.

, Finding humor with your partner can be enhanced by good-natured physical contact. This may be a gentle squeeze, shoulder or knee nudge, playful slap, knuckle nudge or soft push. Always be sure that your partner doesn’t mind when you nudge them and never hit hard, cause pain or leave bruises., You can wrap your legs and feet together, play footsie under the table, put your feet in your partner’s lap or vice versa. This connects you physically and keeps you aware of each other’s presence if you are sitting directly across from him or her. Remember, any physical contact that is intended to convey affectionate feelings is a form of physical affection.

, Along with other forms of physical affection, giving massages can help bring you closer in your relationship. Additionally, massages have health benefits including: reducing stress, increased blood and nutrient flow and helping with pain.

Check in on your boundaries.,
Enforce your boundaries.,
Detach to communicate your intentions.,
Stick to your boundaries.,
Have a backup plan.",How to Detach1," Boundaries are the restrictions you set to protect yourself. You have emotional, mental, physical, and sexual boundaries. They can be learned from parents as you grow up, or you can acquire them by hanging around people who have their own set of healthy boundaries. If you are having trouble managing your time, habits, or your emotions, you may have poor boundaries.If you feel overwhelmed by the feelings of others, or feel that your self-image comes entirely from other people, you need to attend to your boundaries.If you often say ""yes"" to things you don't want to do, set boundaries.
Pay attention to your senses. Do you feel something is wrong? Do you have an unpleasant sensation in your stomach or chest? This may indicate that a boundary wants to be asserted.;
, When you know what you want, or don't want, act. Set boundaries for yourself: a daily schedule, a refusal to accept insults. Set boundaries with others: space from arguments, a refusal to give in to pressure, a refusal to let others put their emotions on you. Say ""no"" when asked to do something you don't want to do.Choose with whom you discuss your life. If you have a parent, friend, or partner who is controlling, don't give them fodder by sharing information with them. Say you will only discuss a topic if you are given no advice (and no orders).

, When you need to establish a boundary with someone, you need to be able to communicate without worrying overmuch about their reaction. This is where emotional detachment comes in. Before you communicate, remind yourself that you are not responsible for how they feel. You have a right to set boundaries.

You can communicate boundaries verbally or non-verbally. As a simple example, when you need someone to give you space, you might stand up, look the person in the eye, and directly state, ""I need some space right now.""

, You may encounter initial resistance from those who are used to getting the reaction they want from you. Hold on to your convictions. Do not compromise a boundary. If you are accused of being withholding or unloving, say ""I am being loving. It wouldn’t be loving of me to pretend I want something I don't.""


For example, if you set boundaries with an elderly parent you care for who is verbally abusive to you, your parent may stop that behavior once he or she sees that you will not tolerate it.

, Detach emotionally from the expectation that your boundaries will be respected. If you are unable to communicate boundaries to someone, or if you communicate boundaries and they are not respected, take charge of them. Set consequences for violated boundaries: say ""if you call me names, I will leave the room. If you go through my phone, I will feel violated and I will tell you exactly how I feel.""

If someone in your life is abusive or unable to control his or her own anger, enact your boundaries without communication.
Take the space you want. Leave if a confrontation is brewing.
Put up physical barriers to things you don't want to be violated. Set a password on your computer and phone, for instance.
If you are a caretaker for a parent who won't respect your boundaries, try hiring someone else to take care of your parent until both of you can calm down and reach a better understanding."

Give verbal affirmations.,
Understand that long-distance relationships require more verbal affection.,
Compliment someone you care about every day.,
Greet your partner or children when they get home.,
Nickname your partner or children.,
Take the time to say “thank you”.,
Don’t assume that “I love you” is the only way to express affection.",How to Be More Affectionate2," Giving verbal affection, such as saying, “I love you” or “I care about you”, is an important way to strengthen bonds and is even good for you physically and mentally.Don’t let texting or emailing the ones you love replace verbal affection. If you are apart, then pick up the phone to check in because it’s more personal, even if it takes more time.


Verbal expressions of affection are the words you speak intended to validate your positive feelings of love and affection and make your partner feel loved. This can be unique to you, your partner and your relationship as long as what you say produces the intended emotions and reinforces your affection for each other.
If you must use electronic modes of communication, sign off with a phrase like “Thinking of you” or “Miss you” instead of a something generic. , Since you won’t be able to physically touch and bolster your bond that way, you will need to tell him or her how you feel more often. This is important to maintain the closeness in your relationship and reinforce feelings of safety, comfort and trust. If possible, use Skype or Google Hangout so you can make eye contact and pick up on physical cues while talking.

, Compliments are a form of showing verbal affection that can boost self-esteem, show you care and make the ones you care about feel good. Additionally, compliments motivate people to succeed because they believe they can. Always give truthful compliments though or you risk what you said being dismissed as shallow flattery.


Look for things that you admire, appreciate or that the other person is good at to compliment. This can be anything from the way they look, a feature of their face that you particularly enjoy (such as eyes or lips), a personality trait, accomplishments, the positive way they make you feel or a skillset that you admire.
Be honest, and don’t let opportunities to compliment those you love pass you by. Tell your wife, “You have beautiful eyes” while looking at her or “You complete me”, if it’s true. Tell your husband, “You look handsome in that shirt” when he gets ready for work or “You’re a great cook” when he makes you breakfast. Tell your child, “You’re so smart” when you see a report card or “You’re good at sports” after practice.

, Stop what you are doing and interact with your partner or children so they know you care. You want them to know they are more important than anything else and that you missed them. Combine verbal affection with physical affection by giving your kids a peck on the cheek or top of the head. You may want to kiss your partner on the lips or cheek.

, A positive nickname shows that you have a special bond. The name you choose usually reflects some characteristic, habit or event related to the person. It can also be a shortened form of their legal name.


Some common nicknames include: Angel, Cowboy, Doll, Babe, Dear, Honey, Love or Sweetheart or Sweetie.

, Think of all the things the other person does for you or the ways they improve your life. Look them in the eyes and express your appreciation in a few sentences. You want them to know exactly how much you love and appreciate them and everything they do.

, If you are not saying it, you should try to make it a regular part of your vocabulary. Phrases like “You’re great”, and “I’m so lucky to have you”, are also good ways to show affection. There is probably also something specific to your relationship, such as a mutual interest in cars, that allows you to expand on these simple phrases to include descriptions of something you really love for added meaning. If you love cars, then you might use a favorite vehicle to explain how you feel by saying, “You’re my 1968 Plymouth Road Runner Hemi.”

Return affection automatically.,
Don’t let only one parent be the “affectionate parent”.,
Make eye contact.,
Give yourself goals.,
Don’t be afraid to talk to a professional.",How to Be More Affectionate3," Answer cues by returning hugs, complimenting, saying “I Love You,” kissing someone on the cheek or high fiving. Ignore the urge to hesitate during these moments. If you aren’t used to doing this, it may take some practice but will become second nature in time.

, In decades past, it was not as culturally important for dads to be affectionate to kids. However, times have changed. Both parents should strive to show affection to their children, even if it is not natural for one of them.

, While you are cuddling, holding hands or giving a compliment, eye contact connects you further and shows you are serious. Studies have shown that staring into the eyes of someone you love (even a pet) can increase oxytocin hormone levels. This can make you both feel really good and is well worth the effort.

, Motivational strategists believe that good habits can be established by dreaming big about the way you would like things to be, such as being a more affectionate parent. Then, give yourself micro quotas, such as “I am going to spend 20 minutes conversing directly with my children every day.” Always break down larger goals into smaller goals so they are more obtainable and give you the opportunity to celebrate your successes more often., If you have no desire to show affection or feel affection but can’t express it, consider speaking to a counselor or therapist—either alone or with your partner. Relationships take work. Don’t associate couple’s counseling or seeking therapy on your own with weakness. If you love someone and want to make it work, then nothing should keep you from seeking help to make your relationship stronger.

Recognize moments that can easily escalate.,
Stay calm.,
Return when you are calm.,
Use ""I statements."",
Exit if possible.",How to Detach2," If you notice you are constantly getting in fights in a certain mood or when certain things are said, detach before you get angry. To do this, recognize the triggers and prepare for moments in which they may appear. Go back over past confrontations and isolate the things that made you angry, or made the other person angry.


You might notice that your partner always picks a fight when she or he is stressed about work. On stressful workdays, you can prepare to detach ahead of time by reminding yourself that she or he may be in a bad mood later.
If the issue is not between you and one person, but rather between you and one situation, recognize that situation.
For instance, you might always start to panic in bad traffic. Recognize that this is a big stressor for you.

, When a moment escalates, or when a trigger is presented, take a moment to calm yourself down. Remind yourself what is happening, and take two deep breaths.Remember that in these moments you can only control yourself, not anybody else.

, Take as much time as you need to step away from a confrontation. Spend some time stating how you feel. Say ""I feel angry that my mother tried to tell me what to do, and I feel frustrated that when I said this she started yelling at me."" Naming your emotions will give you some space from them.


Only return when you can name how you feel without feeling a new surge of emotion., Say how you feel, and what you would like. Avoid the temptation to criticize or blame. You can say ""I would like to hear how you feel about this, but I'm afraid we're going to have a fight. Can we take a minute, and then you can say it to me again?"" Or say ""I notice I'm getting really freaked out about how messy the house is. I would feel a lot better if we had a plan.""

, If it feels safe to take a physical break from a situation you would like to de-escalate, go ahead and take it. A walk around the block or a little time to yourself in another room can help you calm down. On your break, focus on how you feel. Try to name it if you can. Forget your partner for a moment, and take care of your own feelings.

You can return when you are ready to re-engage. Come back calmly, knowing that your partner may still be upset.

"
Decide if detachment is appropriate.,
Detach without neglecting shared responsibilities.,
Take physical space.,
Explain to your partner that you need to focus on yourself for a while if you are asked.,
Get support from friends.,
Focus on getting in touch with yourself.,
Decide what's next.",How to Detach3," If you are unhappy in a relationship, ending it quickly may rob you of the possibility to get to the root of the problem. It can take months to figure out if your partnership can improve or not. In some cases, it might make sense to detach emotionally for a short period, while staying in the relationship.

For instance, you might detach if your relationship has soured due to a recent change in you and your partner's routine. You might both just need time to readjust.
If you and your significant other are constantly at odds, or in an on-again-off-again pattern, consider detaching.
When tensions die down, both of you can reach a better decision about whether or not the relationship should continue.
Don't detach before you have tried seriously to fix the issues in your relationship. Detachment should only be employed if you are on the verge of breaking up., If you live together, have a child, or own a pet, a home, or business, you will need to remain physically present and attentive. Detaching emotionally means holding back emotionally from the relationship for a while, but you can still share labor and everyday activities with your partner.

, If you and your partner do not share responsibility for a child, another dependent, a pet, a home, or business, you may have the option of taking physical time apart. Take a business trip or a vacation by yourself, or with a group of non-intimate acquaintances, such as a hiking group.

, Don't announce your plans to detach, but if asked, say that you are thinking about the relationship and focusing on yourself for a while. You may not want to use the word ""detach"" or ""disengage"" unless that is the language you and your partner already share. Instead, say you need time to focus on a project you have, on getting right with yourself, or on work.

, It is unfair to your partner if you expect emotional support from them while simultaneously withholding your emotions from them. It will also make it hard for you to stay disengaged. Rely on your friends and family for advice and socialization. Confide in friends and family that are your own, rather than yours and your partner's.

, In your time detached, focus on figuring out your feelings. What do you need to change in your relationship? What of your needs are unmet? It may help to talk to a therapist. This is a time of sorting through your own feelings, not criticizing your partner.


Abstain from sexual contact during this time.

, If you have realized that you want to stay in the relationship, you may have to woo your partner back. He or she may feel hurt and abandoned by your detachment. Explain that you were afraid of breaking up and that you were trying to cool off and not make a rash decision. Make an honest attempt to state your needs and listen to the needs of your partner.


If you have decided that your relationship is over, use the perspective gained in your detachment to compassionately end your relationship."
"
Take a break from your ex.,
Take a break from social media.,
Remember why it ended.,
Practice forgiveness.,
Take care of yourself.,
Call it a transition, not a loss.,
Date when you're ready.",How to Detach4," If you are trying to get over someone, even someone you are still on good terms with, take a break from texting or talking with him or her. If you aren't in contact, keep it that way. If you are still in contact, the next time you are in a conversation mention that you need some time to yourself. Say ""I hope we can be friends again, but I can't just jump into it. I need time to process.""

Hang out with other people. Enjoy the company of your family and friends.
If you lost friends in the separation, or are unsure who you can contact of your mutual friends, feel it out slowly. Try getting in contact with your closest people first, and see what happens from there.

, Make it hard to think about the person you are detaching from. Set the external boundary of detaching via social media. If you are on good terms with your ex but are trying to get space, you can temporarily close your account on whatever websites you both use. It can be helpful to avoid pictures of your ex, and, while you are in a wounded state, it can be helpful to spend some time away from images of other people's lives as well.


If you are not on good terms, you can just block or unfriend him or her.
Depending on the website, you may be able to temporarily block notifications from the person without changing your status as ""friends."" However, if you are worried about obsessively checking their material and getting bummed out, you should either shut down your account or drop them as ""friend.""

, Every relationship is full of the fantasy of itself. If your relationship ended, there were probably reasons all along. Once you break up, you might only remember the good parts, or what might have been. Dwell for a while instead on the conflicts, the letdowns, and the things you couldn't do then and can do now.

You don't have to vilify your partner. Just remind yourself that the two of you were not having an easy time of it and that if it hadn't ended, it might have gotten worse.
If you are having trouble remembering what went wrong, try writing down every weak moment of your relationship. Read it over and allow yourself to grieve., After you have allowed yourself to feel the anger and pain of your breakup, choose to move on. Let go of your anger. Allow yourself to feel compassion for yourself and your ex. When you catch yourself feeling angry or resentful, name how you feel.


Say ""I resent that I always paid for our meals out"" or ""I am still angry that she or he never asked me what I wanted,"" or ""I'm ashamed that I lost my temper with her instead of hearing her out.""Write a letter. You do not have to share it with your ex, but you can if you wish. Write out how you have felt and how you feel now.
Forgiveness does not mean condoning anything that happened in the relationship. Rather, it means letting go of the anger that clouds your mood and harms your health., Your focus in the months or even years after a relationship ends is learning how to live well without a partner. Once you have grieved, been angry, and worked on forgiveness, you can start working on enjoying yourself. Do things that make you feel balanced: take good care of your health, spend time with friends, do a great job at work, and enjoy outside activities.


If you are miserable, try visiting a therapist. It doesn't have to be forever, but if your breakup has plunged you into a depression, or if you are feeling urges of self-harm, talk to a professional., It's fine to grieve for a relationship that has ended, but don't let yourself dwell forever on what might have been. Instead, think of the things you learned from falling in love, from negotiating your partnership, and from breaking up. Remind yourself that a relationship that ends isn't a bad relationship: relationships can be good and short.

, When you're really feeling right with yourself, you'll be ready to date again. To see if you're ready, ask yourself if you're still angry at your ex, if you still want to be with your ex, if you feel unattractive, or if you are still feeling sad or unbalanced. If you aren't feeling any of these ways, you're probably ready to date.

Start to talk about your plan for deployment.,
Figure out a plan for emergencies.,
Talk about when and how often to communicate.,
Figure out a support system for both of you.",How to Have a Strong Relationship During a Military Deployment1," Before the deployment starts, you and your partner need to sit down and develop a plan. You'll need to talk about how the two of you will manage your time, seek support, and cope during deployment.The two of you need to help one another plan on how to manage. For the person being deployed, this means focusing on the mission, seeking support from other soldiers or military officials, and managing stress overseas. For the person staying home, this means fostering support at home, staying busy, and managing feelings of stress or anxiety when communication is limited.
Try to have as honest and open a conversation as possible. Both of you should feel free to express your feelings, good or bad, about the impending separation. Feelings of jealousy and insecurity are normal when faced with a long separation.Make time to spend alone and talk. Spend some one-on-one time at home together communicating. If you have children, hire a sitter for the night so you and your partner can talk.;
, In the event of an emergency, you need to have an action plan. How will you contact one another? Who at home should be on call to help handle emergencies? These are questions you should answer before deployment.If you're staying at home, know the quickest way to get ahold of your partner. You should also have someone on call, like a friend or family member, that can help you through emergencies while your partner is away.
If you're leaving, know how your partner will be contacted in the event something happens to you. Talk to your partner about how you'll provide support from a distance in the event there's an emergency at home.

, Establishing groundwork for communication is important during deployment. You and your partner should have a game plan in mind in regards to how and how often you'll communicate.There are a variety of options for communication during military deployment. A phone is not always available, but things like e-mail, instant messaging, video chat, or regular mail are all options.
If possible, setting aside a single day of the week to try and talk through a phone or video call may be helpful. If your deployment is fairly routine, you may know when you'll have access to a computer or phone. You can promise to call or video chat around a specific time during those days.
You should also discuss what to do when communication is difficult. There may be times in deployment where access to things like telephones and computers is limited. Talk about what to do during these times. You can agree, for example, to resort to snail mail if necessary.

, You want to make sure both you and your partner have emotional support during deployment. It's a good idea to help one another form support networks prior to the beginning of deployment.For the party leaving, support may involve other soldiers or military members. You may also want to talk about other people you can communicate with long distance. In addition to being close with your partner, you probably have friends and family members that you have a close bond with. You should be able to rely on these people for support during deployment.
If you're staying at home, you and your partner should figure out who you'll lean on. Talk about the family members and friends you'll have while your partner is away. You may find your partner's friends and family members can provide support during your deployment as well.

Get your pet a comfy bed.,
Get your cat a condo.,
Designate one piece of furniture for pets.,
Use treats as an incentive.,
Crate or confine your pet at night.,
Restrict your pet's access from the start.",How to Keep Pets off the Furniture1," Before you can train your dog or cat out of sleeping on the couch or bed, you'll need to give your pet a comfortable alternative. You probably won't have much luck keeping your pet off the furniture if you don't provide some kind of alternative.In fact, some pets are better off sleeping on soft furniture, due to arthritic pain or discomfort sleeping on the floor.A dog or cat bed can help provide your pet with a comfortable place to sleep without causing you any inconvenience.;
, If your cat continually climbs on furniture and it's causing you problems, one of the best alternatives you can provide your cat is a cat condo. Cat condos are multi-level structures that allow cats to climb, jump, and sleep in one of the ""rooms"" or on one of the platforms. These indoor structures allow your cat his own place to sleep while also allowing him to climb and get exercise., If your pet isn't satisfied with sleeping in a dog or cat bed, consider designating one piece of furniture as a pet-friendly spot.It could be an old arm chair or a love seat that you don't really use anymore - anything that your pet will take a liking to. However, it's important to reinforce to your pet that he can't climb on other pieces of furniture.


Some animals may have a hard time understanding, especially at first, why one piece of furniture is okay but others aren't. The key is consistency. Any time your pet tries to climb up onto a ""humans only"" piece of furniture, lead him off that furniture and onto his designated chair., Once you provide your pet with an alternative, ""pet-friendly"" piece of furniture, you may need to train your pet to use that piece of furniture instead of humans-only furniture. Treats can be very effective for this. Leave treats on the dog/cat bed, in the cat condo, or on the pet-friendly piece of furniture to make these pieces of furniture highly desirable to your pet.Any time your pet tries to get on a humans-only piece of furniture, make him get down, and toss a treat onto the piece of furniture or bedding you've provided for him.

, If your dog or cat keeps trying to climb into your bed at night, you may want to consider crating him or confining him to another room when you go to sleep. Even simply closing your door and keeping him out of your room may be effective, provided that you give your pet a comfy bed or blanket to sleep on in the crate or room you confine him to., If you've recently brought home a new pet, or you plan to in the near future, it's best to restrict your pet's access to furniture from day one, if being on the furniture is an issue for you. It will be much harder (though not impossible) to break this habit once your pet has learned that it's acceptable to be on the couch/chair/bed, so curbing this behavior from an early age is crucial."

Recognize that you are the only person you can control.,
Speak in “I” statements.,
Step away.,
Regularly take some time for yourself.,
Learn to love yourself.",How to Detach5," You can attempt to guide the actions and reactions of the people around you, but when all is said and done, each person has to make his or her own decisions. The only person whose behavior, thinking, and feelings are within your power to control is you.


Just as you cannot control another human being, another human being cannot control you.
Recognize that the only power another individual has over you is the power you give him or her.

, Get in the habit of talking about negative circumstances from the perspective of how you feel about them. Instead of saying that someone or something has made you unhappy, phrase your complaint by saying, “I feel unhappy because...” or “This makes me feel unhappy.”


Putting things in an “I” perspective can shift your thinking, allowing you to separate yourself as an individual from the situation. This separation can actually help make you more emotionally detached from the other people involved.
This “I” language can also help defuse a tense situation because it allows you to convey your feelings and thoughts without being accusatory.

, Physical detachment can trigger emotional detachment. Walk away from the person or situation causing you anxiety as soon as you can. This does not need to be a permanent separation, but the separation should last long enough for you to calm down from a state of heightened emotion.

, When dealing with a troubling relationship or a situation that you are unable to end, get in the habit of routinely taking the time to decompress after dealing with the source of drama. Consistently take this time for yourself even when you feel that your emotions are under control.


For example, if you need to detach yourself from emotional stress at work, take a few minutes to meditate or unwind as soon as you get home.
Alternatively, take a few minutes during your lunch break to do something you enjoy doing, like reading or taking a walk.
Entering into your own private bubble, even for a few minutes, can give you the balance and steadiness you need when you return.

, You are as important as anyone else. Understand that your needs are important, that your self-love is important, and that you have a responsibility to maintain your own boundaries and wellbeing. You may need to compromise with others from time to time, but you also need to make sure that you are not the only one making sacrifices.


Part of loving yourself means taking care of your needs and goals. If you have a goal that requires you to continue your education, you may need to take the necessary steps to do so regardless of whether those around you—your significant other, your parents—agree with your decision. However, be prepared to do it alone.
Loving yourself also means finding your own sources of happiness. You should never completely rely on any one person to make you happy.
If you feel like your partner or another person is the only source of your happiness, recognize that you need to set better boundaries.

Figure out your partner's language of love.,
Send care packages, if possible.,
Avoid miscommunication in text.,
Keep one another informed on day-to-day happenings.,
Find creative ways to provide long distance support.",How to Have a Strong Relationship During a Military Deployment2," It can be hard to provide support from a distance. Figuring out your partner's language of love can help you figure out the best way to help him or her feel secure. A person's language of love is how that person best feels supported and cared for. People respond best to different types of support and comfort.Some people prefer words of affirmation to feel loved. Statements like, ""I miss you"" and ""I love you"" are helpful. If your partner seems to rely on words, try writing long letters and e-mails expressing how much you care.
For some, actions are more important than words. People may feel supported if their partner shows they care through kind gestures, or sends gifts. If your partner prefers actions, you can send him or her care packages, make video messages, or periodically send gifts.
Unfortunately, some languages of love are harder to cater to from a distance. Some people prefer physical touch and quality time to feel secure. This presents a challenge during deployment. However, you can try to help by telling your partner how much you miss his or her touch, and how you wish your partner was with you just to watch television together on a rainy night.

, If you're able to send care packages to where your partner is deployed, do so. A care package is a great gesture that can help your partner feel secure.Include photos, treats, and small sentimental objects. Be creative. If your partner has a sense of humor, include a funny card or note.
It can also be cute to send ""coupons"" for when your partner gets back. Something like, ""Free for one good back rub"" or ""Free for a fancy dinner out."" This can help give your partner something to look forward to when he or she returns.
Make sure you check military regulations before sending out a care package. During deployment, there may be certain items that are banned.

, During deployment, you and your partner may be communicating through e-mail and text messages a lot of the time. Without verbal cues to help a person read emotions, miscommunication can be a problem. It's easy to misread text, reading benign words as angry. Work on finding ways to make sure your partner is able to understand you when face-to-face communication is not possible.Pause before you send an e-mail or text. Read your words and think about any ways they may be misinterpreted. Could you read anger into this message? Frustration? Jealousy? If so, see if there's a way to reword or add an emoticon to make it clear this is a friendly message. For example, ""I couldn't sleep without you last night"" could be read as resentment, as in, ""I'm disappointed you're not here."" Instead, you could write, ""I miss and love you so much that I couldn't sleep without you last night. <3""
On your own end, remember you can never be 100% certain of intent when communication comes in writing. If you receive something from your partner you worry is angry or upset, try to remind yourself how common miscommunication is during these situations. Take some time to calm down, and then return the message asking, politely, for clarification if you feel you need it. For example, ""I miss sleeping next to you too. Just to be clear, as I know it's easy to misread e-mails, you're not mad I'm gone, right? Just checking. :)""

, Hearing about one another's daily lives will help you and your partner feel close. Share day-to-day happenings when you have the chance, even things that feel silly or trivial. Talk about your trip to the grocery store or who you ran into at the gym. This will make your partner feel like he or she is there with you., E-mails, phone calls, and texts are a nice way to stay in touch. However, try to get a little creative as well. Your partner will feel valued if you think of fun, unconventional ways to communicate during deployment.Make a scrapbook for when your partner gets back, detailing what happened when he was away. Scan images of the scrapbook and send them to your partner.
E-mail your partner snippets of songs or clips from movies that have sentimental meaning to the two of you.
Use smell as a memory. Smell is strongly linked to memory, so sending your partner a small container of a shampoo you use can provide him or her a small reminder of you.
Read the same book together from a distance. This will help the two of you feel close, and give you something to discuss when your partner returns.

Keep a journal.,
Explore your own interests.,
Find a support network.,
Keep things in perspective.",How to Have a Strong Relationship During a Military Deployment3," Journaling can be a great way to process your thoughts while your partner is away. You can also easily keep a journal if you're deployed. Write in a journal a few times a week, chronicling your thoughts and emotions regarding your partner's absence. When you and your partner are reunited, share some of the most heartfelt sections of your journal with your partner., While distance is difficult, it can sometimes provide the opportunity for self-exploration and personal growth. While your partner is away, take this as a chance to explore some of your own interests and passions. Join a book club. Take a cooking class. Take up a new hobby, like running or knitting. Try to make the most of the time you have alone to better get to know yourself and your interests.If you're deployed, it may not be difficult to keep busy. A particularly active deployment should keep your mind engaged. However, some deployments are less hectic than others. While it may be hard to, say, join a cooking class when deployed, you can look into solitary pursuits. You can try reading and writing, for example. Try to explore subjects that interest you by reading books on these subjects during your spare moments away.

, During your separation, you and your partner should both have access to healthy support networks. People are social by nature, and even if your partner is gone you need people you can reach out to.If you're being deployed, do not hesitate to get close to your fellow soldiers. Open up to them about your struggles and stress, and talk about how you're managing your long distance relationship.
If you're staying at home, reach out to friends and family members. You should also reach out to your partner's friends and families. Spending time with people close to your partner can help you feel close to him or her from a distance.

, It's important to keep things in perspective while your partner is away. Have friends and family members you can talk to when you feel frustrated or afraid in your partner's absence. If you know another person with a partner in the military, this person may be able to help you keep things in perspective. While this time is difficult, keep in mind it will not last forever. Try to keep in mind that things are temporary, and your relationship may be stronger after your partner returns.If you're deployed, some of your fellow soldiers have probably also left partners at home during deployment. Try to talk to fellow soldiers about how you're feeling, and ask them for advice on how to cope. Some soldiers have probably been deployed multiple times, and may have advice for you on how to keep things in perspective.

Work out issues on your end.,
Accept personal growth will occur while you're apart.,
Have realistic expectations about communication.,
Seek professional help, if necessary.",How to Have a Strong Relationship During a Military Deployment4," Distance can create a lot of insecurity in a relationship. If you have preexisting issues with insecurity or trust, distance can intensify these feelings. Try to find ways to work on your own insecurities.Talk about your insecurities with your partner and others. While you should not be accusatory when talking to your partner, it's okay to say you're feeling insecure. A little reassurance can go a long way.
Examine your own issues with trust and insecurity. They may stem from a previous relationship. Try to understand that, while it's normal to worry when a partner is away, a lot of insecurity may be baseless.

, When you and your partner are reunited, you will both be slightly different. There is a large chunk of time the two of you did not share, and you both may have become more self reliant during this time. Try to accept that, when your partner returns, your relationship may be different than it was before. This is not necessarily a bad thing. While you have both changed, this may be for the better. The two of you may feel more secure in the relationship after seeing it thrive from a distance., Communication will sometimes be difficult. Try to be understanding of this fact. There may be times when you don't hear from your partner for a few weeks. During these times, have others you can come to for support and care., Long distance can put a large amount of stress on a relationship. It's normal to feel insecure, but if you feel like the stress is becoming too much, seek out a therapist. A qualified therapist can help you work out your insecurities and find better ways to cope with distance. You can find a therapist by asking your regular doctor for a referral or seeing what's covered under your insurance. If you are in school, you may be entitled to free counseling through your university.

Keep food away from the furniture.,
Use double-sided tape.,
Use aluminum foil.,
Block access to furniture.,
Create a gentle booby trap.,
Buy a deterrent device.",How to Keep Pets off the Furniture2," It's possible that your dog climbs on the couch because he knows you snack there, and there might be crumbs in the cushions. Or maybe your cat climbs on the kitchen counter because she knows you put her food bowl up there from time to time. Whatever piece of furniture your pet is climbing on, there's a chance he's come to associate that location with food. Keep food away from the furniture you're trying to train your pet away from, and promptly clean up any messes you make on or near that furniture., One way to train your pet out of using furniture (and keeping your pet off, even when you're not home) is by making the furniture less comfortable. Buy some cheap place mats and cover one side of them with double-sided scotch tape. You can then lay these sticky mats, with the adhesive side up, on whatever counters or couch cushions your pet is drawn to, or just apply double-sided tape directly to the furniture. The sticky sensation will be extremely uncomfortable, yet it won't harm your pet, and if you're using place mats it won't damage your furniture, either., Aluminum foil is another simple furniture deterrent that will make furniture loud and uncomfortable, and therefore undesirable, without harming your pet or damaging your furniture. Simply lay sheets of aluminum foil across couches, chairs, and counter tops. You can also use an upside down plastic carpet runner across your couch and chair cushions., A simple way to keep pets off your couches and recliners is by laying other furniture, like folding chairs, across the cushions. This will remove all temptation by making the furniture completely inaccessible to your pet, yet it's still simple enough for you to easily remove when you want to sit on the couch or chair., One way to train your pet out of climbing onto furniture, especially when you're not home, is to lay a gentle booby trap. A good example of a harmless (yet effective) booby trap is to stack a bunch of empty soda cans on the furniture. Be sure the empty cans are well-rinsed, to ensure that no sticky residue gets on your furniture. You can build a little pyramid, either on a couch cushion or on the headrest above an armchair, and if your pet tries to climb up the toppling cans will frighten him off the furniture. Over time it may startle him enough to stay off the furniture permanently., If you don't want to create your own furniture blockers, there are a number of commercially-available furniture deterrent devices on the market. The Snappy Trainer consists of a large paddle attached to a sensitive trigger, which can detect when an animal has climbed onto the couch or chair cushion and causes the whole device to snap up in the air. The SSSCAT, another motion-activated device, shoots a blast of air at your pet if he crosses the motion sensor while climbing onto your furniture. The Sofa Saver is a device you lay across the couch, and if a pet climbs onto it, the device activates a noisy alarm that will scare away your pet. Each of these devices can prove to be highly effective because they startle your pet without causing any harm, and they can be used even when you're not home."
"
Observe your pet on the couch.,
Say ""Off"" and give a treat.,
Praise your dog, and repeat.",How to Keep Pets off the Furniture3," The off command, though highly effective, does require you to be present and observe your pet climbing onto off-limits furniture. This technique works better for dogs, since dogs tend to respond to verbal commands better than cats. When you observe your dog climbing onto a couch or chair he's not supposed to be on, rather than physically removing him (which may elicit an aggressive reaction from him), teach him the ""off"" command., As soon as you observe your dog on the couch or chair, use a calm-yet-stern voice to say, ""Off."" Then hold a small treat in front of his face, and pull the treat (with your dog's nose in tow) slowly away from the couch or chair and down to the floor., As soon as your dog gets down from the furniture, offer him verbal praise and give him the treat you led him away with. Start out giving him treats every time he climbs down, then gradually taper off how frequently you give treats with the ""off"" command. Eventually you should be able to command your dog to get off the furniture simply by saying, ""Off."""
"
Give your pet more exercise.,
Use chemical deterrents.,
Crate or confine your pet.",How to Keep Pets off the Furniture4," One possible reason your cat may be climbing on furniture is because he isn't getting enough exercise and stimulation on a daily basis. If you cannot provide him with a cat condo, get your cat a scratching post, and use interactive toys that allow him to chase, run, and jump. This should tire him out, removing some of the necessity to climb, scratch, and explore your furniture., Cats and dogs have a natural aversion to anything that smells or tastes like citrus or bitter apple.You can use this to your advantage as you train your pet to stay off counters or furniture. Use citrus-scented cleaning products on the counters you want to keep a cat off of, or spray a little citrus-scented oil or bitter apple on couches to keep pets off. (Just be sure that you don't ruin your furniture by spraying oil extracts on the cushions!) Dogs and cats are both repelled by these scents, and will stay away if you make certain environmental elements smell like these undesirable scents., If your pet tends to climb on furniture when you're not home (evidenced by lots of hair or scratch marks on furniture), consider getting a crate for your dog when you're not home, or confining your pet(s) to a designated area, like a bathroom or kitchen. You can also use baby gates to block access to certain rooms or pieces of furniture.Just be sure your animals have access to food and fresh, clean water, and aren't exposed to uncomfortable temperatures, no matter where you confine them.

Give them food and water.,
Provide your pet with the correct diet.,
Clean the cage often.,
Socialize with your pet.,
Make sure your pet is healthy.,
Be sure that your pet came from a reliable place.,
Do your research beforehand.,
Never hurt or harm your pet.,
Keep your pet clean.,
Be responsible.,
Train your pet.,
Do not overfeed your pet.",How to Be a Good Pet Owner," Any living being needs water in order to survive. Water should be fresh, clean, purified, and changed daily to ensure healthy drinking habits. It's best to change the water at least twice a day to keep it clean.;
, If your animal had a previous owner, it helps to keep them on the same diet they had previously. If you prefer to change their diet suited towards you as the owner and the animal, do it gradually so that they adjust properly. Always give your pet the right amount of food needed - do not over feed, or not give it enough food. For puppies get puppy food, for older dogs get special food for he/she, etc.


Animals require different diets based on age. Puppies will need different types of dog food compared to older dogs and baby chicks need different types of foods to adult birds.

, This should depend on the pet you have. Typically a pet's habitat should be clean so it is a good environment for the animal. Clean the cage at least once a week if possible and any other times if necessary. If it doesn't have good living quarters, the animal will get sick more, feel unhappy, and may even become more aggressive or antisocial.

, Pets nowadays are mainly meant for companionship, so give your dog a snuggle or allow your frog to frolic. Be careful when taking an animal out since there are many dangers.


Always leash dogs, and keep your small pet away from mouse traps. Research to find the dangers near you for your animal to ensure a good outing. If it is not the type of pet that you play with, do not play with it. If you own a hungry snake, chances are that it will become grumpy and irritated at you and will lead to perhaps a painful bite.

, Often check for signs of illness, because unfortunately sometimes you do not realize it until it is too late. For any creature, check for any abnormal lumps or bumps, changes in appetite or behavior, different smell, bleeding, or discomfort.

, It is better to get a pet from a shelter rather than a pet store or breeder, it saves lives. If you do wish to get a pet from a breeder, make sure they are experienced at their work. When adopting a pet anywhere, be sure it is healthy, this will majorly help in the long run.

, Whether from trustworthy websites, books, or veterinarians, it is important to know what you are looking for. For example, no one should get a puppy without puppy-proofing their house or not getting a book about housebreaking! Be sure that your information is accurate, and be sure to find pros and cons in each choice. Otherwise, maintaining the health and happiness of your pet would be extremely difficult!


Give your pet shots that he/she needs, as well as the appropriate care. Devote a day to groom your pet, call a check-up to the vet's, and even an hour to the park. Psychological care is just as important as physical care, so be sure to stimulate your pet constantly with new games, toys, sounds, places, and tricks!

, This is vital for humane reasons to never abuse or hurt an animal.


Do not rub your dog's nose in its ""accident"" or hit a lizard. It is not nice, and in some places you can be charged with animal cruelty.
Always kiss and love a pet, no matter what. If you are mad at it for any reason, go in a different room by yourself and take a few minutes to cool down.
Always pay attention to the animal because they deserve it! However, be sure not to give your pet too much attention, or have too many people around, since this may stress the animal out way too much.

, If you have a dog that rolled in mud or some other dirty pet, get the appropriate shampoo and fill that tub up! Sinks, outside, and boxes could also work.


Be aware that animals may be sensitive in extreme temperatures, so check the water first with your hand. If it is too hot or too cold for you, then chances are it will be the same as well for the animal.
Know to buy a certain kind of shampoo; human shampoo, conditioner, or body wash does not work on animals as this is not the solution for their skin and fur. Instead, go to the local pet store and buy the shampoo specifically needed for them.

, If it is an outdoor pet, put a collar on it with your contact information, the pet's name, any special needs, and a rabies tag.


Put a leash on your dog when going out, and clean up after any messes your pets made. Close the cage door when you put him back so there is no chance of escaping and being in an unsafe place. Being a pet parent is hard work, but well worth it!

, No one wants a cat that jumps on the table, a dog that never stops barking, or a bird endlessly pecking at you. A lot of odd pet behavior is simply caused by boredom, so shake it up a little.


Take your puppy to an obedience class, read a book on how to teach a horse to paint, or anything else that you wish for your pet to do! Make this thing realistic and not too hard, challenging, or dangerous.
Be sure to be very proud after your pet does the trick, but wean him/her off treats overtime. Never yell at your pet for doing something wrong, and do not kick, hit, or abuse the animal in any way.

, Overfeeding a pet is a common problem that causes obesity. If an animal has too many lipids, he or she is more at risk for diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, high blood pressure, and more. This doesn't mean you should cut lipids, as everyone needs some fat. Just be sure to limit this for a fit, healthy pet.

There's no need to do this if you've been around a person sick with something non-communicable, like cancer, or a migraine.;
, Never eat off someone else's plate or drink their beverage. Don't use his or her utensils, even if it's someone close to you. Being careful is the best policy.

, When someone offers you a pen to use, you can use your own clean pen instead.

, Some examples include:


When you pump gas for your car, always use a wet wipe to clean your hands when you get back in your car. There could be billions of active germs or spores on the gas pump at the gas station, since they are rarely cleaned.Always wipe down your steering wheel and gear shift with a wet wipe every time you get in your car.

,


Flush the toilet with your foot, not your hand. Cover the flush in your dirty shoe germs for the next less paranoid, normal person.
If there are no seat covers in a bathroom, cover the seat with toilet paper. Hover over rather than sit on the seat and give yourself a bladder infection from not emptying it properly.
Use the paper towel that you just used to dry your hands, to turn off the faucet, and also to open the door.

, Thousands of people have touched that same shopping cart and you never know where their hands have been.

, Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold). Apply soap, lather well, and rub your hands for at least 30 seconds. Rinse well, and dry your hands with a clean or disposable towel or air dryer.If you are not able to wash your hands, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol., Germs cannot penetrate skin, but they get into your body through open wounds, your mouth, eyes, nose, ears, and other body openings. If you do not allow contaminated items, food or otherwise, to come into contact with these parts of your body, germs cannot harm you.

Your general outlook? All five of these and then some? Are you afraid to admit what's actually the issue? You have to figure out what's wrong before you can fix anything. Thankfully, you have all the answers.


It's possible your answer is ""everything."" All too often one facet of our lives bleeds into the other. Don't be daunted by this. At the end of the day, you create your life. Whether one thing needs to be fixed or everything needs to be fixed, it's all doable. It'll just be a little more work. You'll need some mental resetting, but it's all doable.
;
, Being stuck in a miserable job isn't the problem—it's a symptom of the problem. Being too scared to apply for a new job or being too lazy in your current comfortable, easy routine. You know that phrase ""you are your own worst enemy?"" That applies here. You are not to blame for the hand you've been dealt, but you are responsible for how you played it. What patterns of thinking have been keeping you from playing it better?


Being self-aware is the only way you can really change your thinking. Changing your thinking changes your behavior. Changing your behavior changes what happens to you. If you want a problem to stop, you gotta cut it off at the root. So while this may all seem like a long-winded, unnecessary approach to turning things around, it's not (at least the unnecessary part). This (your thinking, your mental blocks) must be tackled before any change can really be had.

, Ready to have your mind blown? You live in a world of your thoughts. Think about that. Sit back in your chair right now and wrap your mind around that. Everything right now is a construction of you, of your thinking, of your mind. This should lead you to a couple of conclusions:


Awesome. You have the power to live however you want. If you wanted to believe you were the Queen of England, you could. If you wanted to believe you were happy, you would be. You are the only person that holds the power when it comes to turning your life around.
Those things that are making you unhappy? Some of them are imaginary. True, you might have a crappy job and that's undeniable. You might be in a dead-end relationship, you might be unemployed, you might be addicted to hard drugs, you might be suicidal, you might be going nowhere. But how you view your situation can put a spin on things that will make them better. Will make them easier. Easy to know, sure; less easy to do. But knowing this is a fact of life, is half the battle won.

, In order for good things to happen to you, you have to be in the mindset of expecting success. Have you ever tried to walk up to that cute boy or girl with the belief that you'll fail? Exactly. Either you just plain don't or you do manage to walk up, nervous, scared and visibly insecure. All of life isn't that different—to get success, you kind of have to expect it. So if you're working with a negative attitude, that's gotta change.


Start working on positive thinking. It can be quite the chore, so just start with 15 minutes a day. When a negative thought creeps up, take the time to reframe it. It won't come naturally at first, but you'll get better at it. For that 15 minutes, ""My life is terrible"" becomes, ""I'm not happy with life right now and am going to do something about it."" Work on this until you don't allow the negative thoughts at all. It'll be so much easier to get out of bed and take action when your mind is ready and raring to go.

, Newsflash: happiness doesn't come from removing your problems. There are impoverished, hungry children in this world who smile and laugh every day. There are people who are in similar situations to you who consider themselves lucky to be alive. So allow yourself the power to make yourself happy, to view yourself worthy of success. Allow yourself control over your life instead of pretending you're an innocent bystander. Take the reins. You got this.


You're on this page, so clearly you have some motivation to do something. That's all you need and you have it! You need to make the decision to do something. When you do, things will change. They have to. They can't not. Latch onto this motivation and let it fester. Let it grow until it explodes. Get power-hungry. Things are about to happen.

, It's hard to turn your life around if you don't know what direction to face, you know? Having a passion, some goal or dream to strive for gives you a path to tread—instead of foraging about for a needle in a haystack that may or may not be there. So what's yours? Where would you like to be in six months? A year?


Do you see yourself living in the same town? Maybe a different job? Working on a new project or business? In school? Significantly more fit? There's no wrong answer here. And you can have more than one, too!

, With a clearer trajectory now, it's time for a very loose plan of action to form. Come up with half a dozen things you can feasibly do to start down the path you see the future you on. You don't have to start today, you don't have to start tomorrow, but you do have to know where you're going and what you want to do.


We've sorted out the end goal (going back to school, losing weight, quitting smoking, etc.), now how do you get there? That's what this is for. What steps—small ones, big ones, whatever—can get the ball rolling? So when the time comes, when you're ready, you'll know what the future has in store.

, Whether it's quitting smoking, dumping your lame boyfriend or moving out of your mob-running roommate's apartment, it's gotta be done. These things are holding you back. They're facilitating this negative mindset and turning an obstacle into a veritable mountain to climb over. It may be a pain in the rear end, but you know you can do it. Dumping your toxic best friend sucks. Having to live on your own in a crappy studio sucks. Going through withdrawal sucks. But they're all things that you're capable of and that you'll be better for in the end and, quite frankly, you probably know it.


Things like ""quitting your job"" sort of fall into a different category. In today's day and age, you need money to survive. But realistically, you could quit and move in with someone temporarily if you absolutely had to. You could spend your weekends looking for a new one. No one said this was going to be pretty. Sometimes things have to get worse before they get better. You have to be willing to put in the work.

, Why? Because we all need someone who's been there- for their advice, for their shoulder, for the heads up. And if you think there's no one in your life who's hit rock bottom, you're probably wrong. Part of being human is about fighting battles—all you need to do is ask. The odds of you knowing the sordid history of everyone in your circle is slim to none.


However, what's more likely is that when you read the phrase ""find a mentor,"" one or two names pop into your head. Generally, this is a more natural process than anything. If you have to ask someone to be your mentor, they're probably not. This is just a role that's fulfilled by someone who's been there, done that and bought the t-shirt. You just need to take advantage of their presence in your life by opening up to them and asking for assistance when you need it.

, Don't get offended—we all are. We all say ""yes"" to invitations we don't want to say yes to, we all smile and nod when inside we're sending daggers with our eyes. We all do things that society has told us are okay and left it at that, no questions asked. Well start asking questions. Make it a point to say ""no thanks"" when you don't feel like it. Right now is about being selfish and improving you. It's not an excuse to be rude—it's an excuse to do what you want.


This will not hurt others' feelings if you're just being yourself. Declining an offer with a, ""No thanks. I'm not feeling up to it,"" isn't offensive. People may ask further questions, but they don't need an explanation if you don't want to give one. You're just doing you right now. If they have a problem with it, it's theirs to have.

, Your mind and body are interconnected—if your body feels good, it's a lot easier for your mind to feel good. The three tenets of having a body that's ready to take on the world? Exercising, getting enough quality sleep and eating healthily. If you don't have time for these, make time. You owe it to yourself.


As for exercise, try to get in a ""session"" 3 or 4 times a week. Whether that's hitting up kickboxing class or going for a walk with your dog, it's all good. Just get out there and stick with it. Skeptical as to how this matters? Research says exercise can actually make you happier.Get enough sleep—your decision-making skills hinge on it. Seriously.When our bodies and minds are tired, we don't have the energy to weigh out what's actually good for us. Need an example? That late night chalupa you decided to eat was a good idea. Only when it comes to your life, it actually matters. So get in your 7-9 hours of sleep a night. It affects the other 15-17 hours more than we'd like to admit.
Your diet can also affect your mood.Loading up on whole grains, fruits, and veggies and sticking to lean meats and low-fat dairy can give you that edge that you were previously lacking.

, Little things can actually make the biggest of differences. Jumping out of bed in the morning instead of hitting the snooze button can make you feel much more energized, despite logic to the contrary. Listening to uplifting music, leaving yourself positive little notes, rewarding yourself for strides made—it all builds up and can keep you on track.


Change your alarm to something awesome. If you're anything like the rest of us, you wake up in the morning and all you can think of is, ""...No."" Starting out the day negatively can seriously hinder the rest of it. So start out as positively as possible. Change your alarm to something that invigorates you (whether it's The Circle of Life or The Ride of the Valkyries is up to you). ""No"" can turn into ""Hell yes!"" easier than you thought.

, Studies have shown that people who are successful and content generally have a routine they stick to. The routine they stick to probably isn't staying in bed all day and consuming buckets of fried chicken, sure. But what's more important is that their routine allows them to conserve energy. When you have a daily routine, going onto autopilot allows you to expend mental focus on deflating and getting rid of problems that arise. You can only make so many decisions in a day and this routine allows you to save energy for the important stuff.Your routine should involve those three things mentioned above (eating, exercising and sleeping right) and whatever else makes you happy. A little bit of work, a little bit of play and some self-improvement time, whatever form that takes (meditation/job searching/going back to school, etc.)

, Why? You are less likely to be emotionally and physically exhausted. Decision fatigue is definitely a thing—like that poorly thought-out late night chalupa. At night, we've done so much work all day, we throw caution to the wind and let our present selves make poor decisions for our future selves. Don't do it!


So if something big presents itself, sleep on it. You want as much energy as possible to decide what the best course of action is. It's a figure of speech for a reason!

, One of the easiest ways to get in the being-great-at-life zone is to focus on others. It's easy on you and it feels good—in addition to making the world a better place. And for just a second you get to forget about your problems and focus on someone else's. What's not to like?


Helping others gives us a buzz unlike anything else. And doing so can get us out of a rut when we don't have enough energy to help ourselves. So whether it's donating some things to a thrift store or volunteering your time at the local homeless shelter, try it out. Might as well build some good karma to be safe!

, No one can go from 0 to 60 in 3.5, and you shouldn't expect this of yourself either. We all need assistance and a shove in the right direction. No Olympian would start the race in a sitting position, you know? So whatever you need to do, do it.


So sign up for that class. Find a therapist. Get serious about your job search. Succumb to online dating. Join Alcoholics Anonymous. Call your mom and make amends. Join the gym you've been driving by every day on the way home from work. The first step will be the hardest and it will all be downhill from there.

, You've got your mind right, you've got your body right, and now it's time to do that thing you've been wanting to do. That thing you've been too afraid to do. You've gotta bite that bullet. One foot at a time, regardless of how long your path to a turned-around life is.


That class you've signed up for? Go. Your therapist? Make an appointment. Submit job resumes. Go on dates. Attend meetings. Initiate a family lunch. Get on that treadmill. Being amazed at yourself and the things you can create will be such a good feeling it'll be hard to stop.

, Consider this a diet for your soul. Any diet that isn't working needs to be dropped, so routine evaluation is necessary. Are you beginning to feel better? Are things slowly but surely falling into line? Could you up the efforts you're making? Just like you need to increase the intensity of your workouts as you progress, you need to keep pushing your mind, too.


What works for you right now may not be enough in a few weeks' time. Once you get a grip on the efforts you've started out with, add more and more. There are very few things in life you can go cold turkey on, and this isn't one of them.
To a similar end, what you think will work might not. If that's the case, talk to your mentor and get advice on what you should do. Is it something you need to push through, abandon completely or is there a different tactic you should take?

, You're in a very precarious position right now: a wrong footing and it'll be too easy to fall back to where you were. So right now, focus on staying motivated. Focus on positive thinking. Focus on breathing. Focus on doing you. If you refuse to give up, guess what? You won't.


Obstacles happen. They crop up without warning and sometimes unyieldingly so. The car breaks down, the relationship falters, the cravings get worse and worse. Knowing these will happen is important—that way, you're a little prepared and don't blame yourself. They happen to everyone and they're a part of life. You just gotta roll with the punches.

Don't fess up right away.,
Start touching your partner's feet when you're ready.,
See how he or she reacts.,
If your partner reacts positively, compliment his or her feet.,
Pick the right time to do it.,
Act a little nervous.,
Spit it out.,
React appropriately to your partner's feelings.",How to Admit to a Foot Fetish," If you want your partner to be okay with your foot fetish, then the worst thing you can do is blurt it out right away. If you're just in the middle of your first date, or even kissing for the first time, saying, ""I have a foot fetish!"" is likely to turn your night in the wrong direction. If you want to tell your partner about your foot fetish and get the best results, then you have to wait for the perfect time -- when you know each other a little better.


Ideally, you should wait until you have a sexual experience before you discuss your foot fetish. Otherwise, it may be too much, too soon.
On the other hand, you don't want to wait too long -- if you walk down the aisle before admitting your lifelong obsession with feet, then you may run in to some serious trouble.;
, Once you've gotten more comfortable with your partner, it's time to test the waters. If you've found yourself in bed are in various degrees of undress, you can try kissing your partner's stomach, legs, and then move your way down to the feet. Don't go straight for the feet or you may freak your partner out. You can also just start touching your partner's feet if you're watching TV and you want to give him or her a sexy foot massage.


Don't start licking or sucking on your partner's feet yet -- this may be too much too soon as well.

, How does your lady or man react when you go for the feet? Do hear murmurs of approval, the occasional, ""Oh, that feels good,"" and see a nice relaxed smile on his or her face? If so, then things are moving in the right direction. If your partner pulls away, or even outright says he or she doesn't like it when you touch his or her feet, then it's time to abort the mission.


If your partner reacts negatively, don't be discouraged. You may still be able to turn things around. However, this does mean that you shouldn't go for the feet again until you have the big talk.

, Don't go overboard -- just say, ""You have such sexy feet,"" or ""I just love your feet."" Don't make it sound like a fetish yet -- just tell your partner that he or she specifically has amazing feet. This will make it easier for your partner to swallow the news than if you flat-out stated that you categorically love all feet before paying special attention to your partner's feet.


Additionally, if you're a guy, and really feel like you need to mention her feet, you can compliment her about it when you're having a night out. You can say, ""Your feet look great in those shoes."" But don't overdo it, or little will she know, you have a foot fetish and think you only like her for her feet.

, When is the right time to admit to a foot fetish? There's no golden rule, but you probably should not do it in the middle of a hook-up. Instead, pick a time when you and your special someone are hanging out and feeling good about each other -- while having some privacy. You can tell your girl or guy when you're back at your place and you think you may be close to hooking up again.Fessing up in the middle of hooking up or cuddling may give you a reaction you may not be ready for, and can interrupt the mood (though not ruin it for good!).

, Though your foot fetish may be something you've had for years and seems perfectly normal to you, you should be considerate of your partner. Sure, you think feet are hot -- plenty of people share your feelings. However, to a person without a foot fetish, this news will seem a bit unexpected, so you shouldn't just drop this comment like you're announcing that you think it's about to rain.


Say, ""There's something I have to tell you..."" and let your partner see that you have something important to say so you get his or her attention.
Don't act too nervous or your partner will be nervous too. Just act nervous enough that your partner will see that you really care about what she thinks.

, Be honest. Just say, ""Hey, I have a thing for feet."" Or, ""I want you to know that I have a foot fetish."" That's it. There's no need to say why, or how long you've had it, or how much you love sexy, sexy, feet. Just tell your partner, let it out, and feel the relief of finally fessing up flood over you. Make eye contact, look at his or her face, and wait for a reaction.


If you hear nothing, you can ask, ""What do you think?"" But generally, it's a good idea to give your partner some time to process the news.

, There are a few ways that this news can be taken. The best case scenario is if your partner says, ""Really? That's kinky. I don't mind at all!"" However, it's more likely that your partner will want more information or won't quite know how to react. The worst case scenario is if your partner is completely not accepting of your fetish and thinks that feet are completely gross. You've said your piece, though, and now it's time to be mature and to deal with your partner's reaction in a calm and adult fashion. Whatever happens, you should be proud of yourself for being honest.


If your partner accepts your foot fetish on the spot, great. Prepare for a night of kinky fun.
If your partner needs some time to deal with it, take things slow. Don't try to touch his or her feet too much during your next kissing session -- wait for your partner to give you the green light.
If your partner is just flat-out not into it, then there's no need to not try to force it. After all life is short and you have a foot fetish. Now, it's up to you to decide if you can handle a relationship that doesn't allow you to indulge your foot fetish. There is also a chance that over time they will warm up to it and become curious after awhile.

Take your temperature with a thermometer.,
Leave your fever alone if you can.,
Stay at home.,
Get plenty of rest.,
Stay hydrated.,
Make yourself eat.,
Keep cool.,
Take over-the-counter medicine to be more comfortable.",How to Act when You Have Fever1," Any body temperature over 98.6°F (37°C) is considered a fever, though fevers lower than 103°F (39.4°C) in adults generally aren’t dangerous. Monitor your temperature on a regular basis while you're sick, at least twice a day, to track whether it’s improving or worsening.


There are many types of thermometers on the market ranging from the usual under-the-tongue (oral), to rectal (in the bottom), tympanic (in the ear), and temporal artery (on the forehead) thermometers. The latter are usually used for kids (rectal for infants), whereas most adults get a close enough reading with an oral thermometer.You can also take a child's temperature under their arm.Normal body temperature actually varies between 97°F (36.1°C) and 99°F (37.2°C). It’s also affected by things like exercise and hormonal fluctuations like menstruation and menopause.;
, Your body is causing your fever on purpose to fight off germs. It might not be comfortable for you, but your fever is actually helping you get better. When possible, don’t treat mild fevers – lowering your fever can actually keep you sick longer, or cover up other symptoms.If you can cope with the discomfort, bundle up in bed with soup and TV or a good book and leave your fever untreated.


Generally, do not treat fevers under 102°F (38.9°C) unless your doctor tells you to., Do not go to work or school if you have a fever. Not only will you feel terrible and probably be pretty unproductive, you’ll be putting more stress on your body rather than allowing it to rest and recover. Stay home to rest and protect your coworkers or classmates from catching what you have.


Have good sickness hygiene if you leave the house or live with other people. Wash your hands frequently, especially after using the bathroom, coughing, or sneezing. Cover your mouth when you sneeze or cough. Do not prepare food for others when you’re sick, and don’t share cups or utensils., When you’re feverish, stay in bed and rest. You’ll probably feel pretty weak and tired.Rest and sleep help you and your immune system recover from illness. When less energy is being spent on waking activities, your body has more energy to fight infection.

, It’s really easy to get dehydrated when you have a fever; in fact, dehydration is usually the most dangerous thing about having a fever.Sip on water throughout the day to stay hydrated, even if you don’t feel like it. Have plenty of other clear fluids like soup, tea, and juice. If you’re nauseated, suck on ice chips – you have to get fluids somehow.


Don't drink alcohol.Alcohol dehydrates you and makes it harder for your body to fight infection.
If you become severely dehydrated you might need an IV at the hospital.
Signs of dehydration include feeling really thirsty, having a dry mouth or dry skin, not urinating as much as usual or having dark urine, and feeling weak, dizzy, fatigued, or lightheaded., You might lose your appetite when you have a fever.However, you should force yourself to eat even small amounts throughout the day – your body needs fuel to fight infection and recover. Eat small amounts of healthy foods that you can tolerate – fruits, vegetables, grains, cereal, soup, and smoothies are good options.


Cater to your other symptoms to stay comfortable. If you’re having nausea or diarrhea, stick to the BRAT diet – bananas, rice, applesauce, toast, and tea. If your throat is sore, drink warm liquids like tea and soup.

, Get more comfortable by keeping yourself cool. Dress in light clothing, sleep with light bedding, or open a window for some fresh air.Dampen a washcloth with cool water and put it on your neck or forehead for some soothing relief.

, Fevers may occur with headaches, body aches, chills, sweats, and shivering.If your fever is over 102°F (38.9°C) and you feel extremely uncomfortable or you have to feel better to be productive, take an OTC pain reliever and fever reducer.Acetaminophen products like Tylenol and ibuprofen products like Advil and Motrin can improve aches and pains and temporarily lower your fever.


Understand that these medications do not cure your illness, they just temporarily improve your symptoms.
Don’t take these products if you have liver or kidney damage or have had stomach ulcers. Only take them as prescribed by your doctor or indicated on the label.
Adults can take aspirin for discomfort, as well. Never give aspirin to children – it’s been known to trigger a serious illness in kids called Reye’s Syndrome."

Give it time.",How to Treat Ulcers," Abdominal problems are often difficult to diagnose since the symptoms of any one problem are reminiscent of lots of different kinds of issues, including gastritis, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, and a variety of other problems.It's important to see your doctor and arrive at a proper diagnosis if you think you may have an ulcer, so you can receive the proper care. Ulcer symptoms include:


Persistent or recurring stomach or abdominal pain
Discomfort or a bloating sensation in the abdomen
Nausea and vomiting
Loss of appetite
Traces of blood in vomit
Dark black or tarry-looking stool indicative of bleeding from the upper part of the small intestine
Weight loss, pallor, lightheadedness, and weakness due to persistent blood loss;
, If you're having stomach problems, it's not necessarily an ulcer. Based on the history of your symptoms, your diet, and a physical exam, your doctor will be able to rule out the possibility or might advise further investigations to confirm it.


The doctor may start you on medication to reduce the pain and acidity if the symptoms are mild.
Inform the doctor if there is persistence of blood in your vomit, if the stools continue to appear black, or if your symptoms worsen. There may be an underlying serious condition that needs to be taken care of. In such a case you will be asked to undergo tests to determine the cause of the bleeding.

, Your general practitioner may recommend that you visit a GI (gastrointestinal) specialist, during which time you may go through tests which can be used to properly diagnose any kind of digestive ulcer.


Two non-invasive tests that can be used to rule out other causes include an ultrasound of your whole abdomen and an MRI. While these tests won't show an ulcer, they do help your doctor rule out other issues.Non-invasive upper gastrointestinal (GI) x-rays can help your doctor see an ulcer. After drinking a chalky substance called barium, you will have x-rays taken to look for signs of ulcers in your stomach.
Once the ulcer is detected, the doctor may advise endoscopy to know the exact location and extent of the ulcer. While you are under mild sedation, the doctor will insert a thin tube with a small camera at the end down your throat and into your stomach. The camera allows the doctor to see inside of your digestive track and take a tissue sample, known as a biopsy. This is a simple and almost painless procedure.
A breath test will be conducted to see if your body currently has an active ulcer caused by H. pylori bacteria. If you do have an ulcer, it will convert urea used in the test to carbon dioxide, which you will exhale.
A stool test with a culture is done to confirm bleeding and also the presence of H.pylori.
Blood tests will be performed to check for growths or antibodies to H. pylori. Blood tests can only show exposure to H. pylori, so it won't confirm that you currently have an ulcer., Ulcers need to be healed by addressing the underlying condition of the ulcer specific to you. That's why it is important to get a proper diagnosis and follow through with your doctor's recommended treatment. Most treatments involve medication, eliminating the cause of the ulcer and dietary changes.


Often, H. pylori infection is to blame, in which case the doctor will prescribe an antibiotic to help eradicate it. Since treating H. pylori requires a combination therapy, you will also be prescribed a proton-pump inhibitor like omeprazole (Prilosec) or an H2 agonist (Pepcid), which blocks the production of acid in your stomach and allows your stomach to heal.,, Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can cause ulcers and can exacerbate the symptoms. Avoid taking NSAIDS while you have an active ulcer and for extended periods of time thereafter.


If you need to take medication to deal with pain symptoms, ask a doctor about your options. In some cases, you might be able to take NSAIDs along with an acid reducer, or you can pursue alternative pain treatments.

, Often you will feel indigestion and heartburn, with burning and nausea in the upper abdomen under the ribs. Antacids can be used to provide temporary relief of symptoms, but will not ultimately cure ulcers. Be careful when using antacids as they can prevent your medications from working. Over the counter antacid choices include:


Calcium carbonate, found it products like Tums and Rolaids, is probably the most common OTC antacid.
Sodium bicarbonate products such as Alka-Seltzer and Pepto Bismol (Bismuth Subsalicylate) can also be used to soothe the lining of the stomach, and are widely available.
Magnesium hydroxide is also commonly recommended, marketed as Phillips' Milk of Magnesia.
A mix of aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide is sold as Maalox, Mylanta and other brands.
Less common antacids include aluminum hydroxide, sold under the brand names AlternaGEL and Amphojel, among others.

, Ulcers vary from person to person, so it's hard to say what foods are good for ulcers and what foods are bad. For some people, spicy food may cause no problems, but olives or pastries may drive them crazy with pain. Try to eat a relatively bland diet while your ulcer heals, and identify the things that make it worse.


Often, high-sugar foods, processed foods, fried foods, salted meats, alcohol, and coffee make ulcers worse.Increase your fluid intake.
Try keeping a food journal and write down everything that you eat in a day, so that you can have a record of which foods cause a flare up of pain.
Be judicious about what you cut out in the short term to heal up in the long term. A little discipline now will help your stomach heal quickly and let you get back to a less restricted diet and lifestyle.

, Some estimates show that the average person gets about 14 grams of fiber a day. Try to get upward of 28-35 grams of fiber a day to treat your digestive tract right.A high-fiber diet that contains a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables helps to reduce your chances of getting an ulcer, and helps existing ulcers heal.Try getting fiber from the following sources:


Apples
Lentils, peas, and beans
Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and other brassica
Berries
Avocados
Bran flakes
Flaxseeds
Whole wheat pasta
Barley and other whole grains
Oatmeal

, Some research suggests that foods containing naturally occurring flavonoids can help to heal ulcers more quickly.Flavonoids occur naturally in many fruits and vegetables, making them good for you to consume on two levels. Good sources include:


Apples
Celery
Cranberries
Blueberries
Plums
Spinach

, Teas and supplements containing licorice root can help to heal ulcers and keep them from coming back.It's important to distinguish between sugary licorice candy, which can make stomach troubles worse, and natural licorice root, which is used in supplements and teas. Only use the latter as an additional treatment for ulcers.

, Cut back or eliminate those foods from your diet.


Although doctors now believe that spicy foods do not cause ulcers, some people with ulcers do report that their symptoms worsen after eating them., Acidic fruit drinks, including orange juice, grapefruit, and other citrus juices can make the symptoms of ulcers much worse. For some people, it may not be a problem, but it can be extremely painful for others. Limit your citrus-intake, if it seems to bother your ulcer.

, Coffee is highly acidic, which can exacerbate the symptoms of ulcers. Carbonated soft drinks and colas likewise can irritate your stomach lining and make your symptoms worse. Try to cut out your morning cup of coffee in the short-term if you're suffering from an ulcer.


Caffeine in and of itself doesn't make ulcers worse, but acidic soft drinks, some strong teas, and coffee do. Try switching to more gentle herbal teas if you have an ulcer. If you need a little caffeine kick, try adding some guarana to your tea., Smoking increases the chances of ulcers developing and makes it more difficult for existing ulcers to heal. Smokers are twice as likely to develop ulcers as non-smokers, making it critical that you quit smoking if you want to allow your ulcer to heal properly.Smokeless tobacco and other forms of tobacco come with the same, and even increased, risk of stomach problems.Try your best to quit tobacco altogether if you have an ulcer.
Talk to your doctor about tapering methods, including using prescription medication to help you ease off of a nicotine dependence. Over the counter patches and nicotine supplements are also available, which can help.

, Alcohol irritates the stomach lining, and it takes a while for the stomach to heal completely. If you're recovering from an ulcer, or any kind of stomach trouble, it's important to avoid alcohol while you're recovering. Even a beer or two can aggravate your ulcer.Alcohol in moderation may be alright after all treatment has ended, but you should discuss it with your doctor before resuming drinking in any capacity.

, For some people, ulcers can get a lot worse at night. Laying flat on your back can cause certain ulcers to become more painful, and nighttime is the worst time to be in pain. Try sitting with your head and shoulders elevated slightly off the mattress, to keep yourself at an inclined position. Some people have success sleeping more soundly like this when ulcers are bothering them., Eating a big meal in the middle of the day can make an ulcer worse. Instead, try to time your meals at regular times throughout the day, and have more small meals, as opposed to a few really big ones. This will help your stomach to process smaller amounts of food more easily.


Avoid eating food too close to bedtime, which can cause nighttime pain that will keep you from sleeping more soundly.
Some people find that the symptoms of ulcers are made worse after eating, while others find that eating can soothe the ulcer pain.Experiment some with your diet to see what works for you.

, Any time you go to the doctor from here on out, you need to let them know that you've dealt with ulcers in the past, and you'd like them to consider your history of stomach troubles when prescribing medication. Even if you've been ulcer free for many years, certain medications can irritate your stomach and make it much worse. Always consult your doctor before switching medications or taking something new.

, The stomach can take quite a while to heal completely, and most doctors recommend that you take a fairly rigorous approach to your recovery, and allow a period of at least 2-3 months before you consider yourself ""healed."" Even then, a return to a diet or lifestyle that resulted in your ulcers flaring up in the first place can cause your ulcers to come back, perhaps stronger this time. It's important to commit to your health and give your stomach the time it needs to heal.


Some people may heal faster than others, but it's important to continue your dieting and lifestyle changes well beyond when your symptoms subside. Don't celebrate having no stomach pain with a couple drinks, or the pain could return.

Learn to look beyond the marketing claims accompanying pet food.,
Locate the ""Guaranteed Analysis"" on the pet food label.,
Be aware that percentages alone don't tell the whole story.,
Be mindful that pet food manufacturers can manipulate this information.,
Some pet owners search for pet foods that use human grade ingredients with no animal by-products and avoid pet foods that use artificial colors, flavors, sugars and chemical preservatives (notably BHA and BHT).,
Do a cost per weight analysis to determine the weight value of the pet food product.,
Check the label for ""nutritional adequacy"".,
Read the feeding instructions.,
Be savvy about marketing claims such as natural, organic, premium, etc.",How to Read a Pet Food Label," In the USA, pet food labeling is regulated on a federal (FDA) and state-by-state basis, with guidance from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). However, AAFCO provides only minimum requirements. The reality is that pet food producers often use terms that are undefined by the regulations, in order to communicate more effectively with consumers and improve their product's image in the market.

The AAFCO warns on their website that ""it is not rare at all that labeling and marketing information is designed to appeal to the latest trend in marketing human products."" In other words, the focus tends to be more on appealing to our preferences than on whether or not the food is suitable for your pet. For this reason, learn to look behind the marketing hype and to find the real substance of the nutrition status within the pet food.



 


It is important to always check the ingredient list because a named food is not always necessarily the primary ingredient.;
, See the example under ""Tips"" below. Note that the percentages given for protein, fat, and fiber are measurements of the food in its current state. However, because different pet foods have different levels of moisture, you can only logically compare pet foods on a dry matter basis. Moisture levels in pet foods can range from approximately 6 percent to as much as 80 percent.

Canned food obviously contains more moisture than dry kibble. But it may not necessarily contain as much protein, for example. You can't tell which food contains the most protein, fat or fiber until you have converted both labels to a dry matter basis.






Determine the amount of dry matter first, by subtracting the percentage given for moisture from 100 percent. Using the example below, the moisture accounts for 10 percent of the pet food. Therefore, the dry matter content is (100% - 10% = ) 90% of the pet food.
Convert the protein, fat and fiber percentages to a dry matter basis by dividing the percentages given on the label by the amount of dry matter (from the previous step). In our example, the 26 percent protein on the label converts to 28 percent on a dry matter basis by dividing 26% by 90%. (Notice that in this example the dry matter calculation is only slightly different than the labeled percentage. This is because the moisture level was only 10 percent per the label. If the moisture level had been, say, 40 percent, then the dry matter content would have only been 60 percent and protein on a dry matter basis would have been calculated as (26% divided by 60% =) 43%.)
Compare the new protein level of 28 percent on a dry matter basis to other pet foods (once you've converted the other pet food labels in the same way). Do similar comparisons for fat and fiber after converting to a dry matter basis calculation.

, You may have 28 percent protein on a dry matter basis, but what is the source of that protein? You can get protein from chicken beaks and feet that are not good sources of nutrition for your pet! This means that you'll need to look next at the list of ingredients. Pet foods must list ingredients in order of weight.

Generally, the first five ingredients will make up the majority of the pet food product. Ideally, look for meat as one of the first ingredients on a pet food label. Grains, such as corn, cornmeal, whole wheat, barley, rice are used to provide essential energy for the pet and appealing texture to the kibble.






Even the AAFCO website admits that ""Economics plays a part in any ingredient selection"" and ""protein is not simply protein. Ingredients providing protein have specific amino acids which may or may not match the amino acid profile required by a cat or a dog."" Manufacturers routinely combine multiple protein sources to provide for all the amino acids required for a healthy life.

, For example, by breaking an ingredient down into components and then listing them individually so that you don't notice an easily recognized undesirable ingredient too near the top of the list, this information can be effectively changed enough to cause you to read the label differently.

, However, some animal by-products like liver and other internal organs are excellent sources of the amino acids and other nutrients that dogs and cats need. In addition, dry pet foods need preservatives to prevent spoilage and degradation of essential nutrients.


Contact the manufacturer direct to find out what the ""by-products"" listed in their product actually consist of. Be aware that this may change without warning. Sometimes your pet's reaction will be enough to make this obvious!

, The density of dry products can be changed through puffing up the food, while different wet foods can be labeled with pounds or ounces (or other measurements), making weight comparison harder. Check the price comparison to get the real value.

, This is one of the most important aspects of a pet food label because it can impact a pet's health if claims are made about being nutritionally complete when the product is not able to meet all nutrient requirements for your pet. To be reassured on this count, look for:


The words: ""(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO (Dog/Cat) Food Nutrient Profiles.""
Or look for the words: ""Animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (name of product) provides complete and balanced nutrition.""
Be sure to choose the right life cycle stage for your pet - this should be on the label too (for example, kitten/puppy). Pet food needed for pets that are growing, reproducing or working hard should be chosen with care that it can meet all the nutrient requirements for that pet. Size, breed or senior labeling claims must meet the criteria for adequate adult pet nutritional needs; in reality, the more precise claims are harder to ascertain.

, Even if you think you know how to feed your pet the particular product, changes do happen or you might have transposed feeding instructions from one product to a new one. Always read these with care to ensure that you are feeding your pet adequately. However, even though manufacturers try to cover all contingencies, you still need to monitor your own pet's needs, preferences and environmental conditions. Talk to your vet if you're unsure, especially with respect to growing and reproducing pets.And don't forget to visit the vet every month or so to be sure..


As part of feeding, also read the calories provided by the product. The amount of calories provided can vary considerably between products and between dry and wet foods. If your pet is growing, overweight or underweight, or has an illness, calories are of especial interest.
Calorie statements are made on a ""kilocalories per kilogram"" basis. Kilocalories are the same as the ""Calories"", while a ""kilogram"" is a unit of metric measurement equal to 2.2 pounds. It may also be stated as ""per cup"" or ""per can"", alongside the required kilocalories per kilogram statement.

, These are marketing words without official definitions to back them up. While it is surely to be hoped that all pet food is ""natural"", this usually refers to a lack of artificial additives, colors or flavors. The words ""premium"" and ""gourmet"" and the like are marketing speak and don't mean anything more than what the overall packaging suggests to the consumer. Organic pet food should be free of synthetic additives but guidelines are still under development for the official meanings.

See your doctor for fevers over 103°F (39.4°C) or cognitive symptoms.,
Get medical assistance if you have other severe symptoms.,
Monitor your feverish child and seek care if necessary.,
Get medical help for feverish or symptomatic infants.",How to Act when You Have Fever2," For adults, fevers aren’t dangerous until they get to be 103°F (39.4°C) or higher.Fevers between 103°F (39.4°C) and 106°F (41.1°C) can cause serious symptoms like confusion, irritability, hallucinations, convulsions or seizures, and severe dehydration.If you or someone you know is experiencing these symptoms, seek medical care right away.


If you have a fever that stays over 105°F (40.5°C) even after taking medicine, call for emergency help. This is a dangerously high temperature that requires treatment in a hospital if it cannot quickly be controlled at home., Call your doctor or go to the hospital if your fever is high or lasts longer than 3 days.Your doctor will try to diagnose your fever – if you seem to have a bacterial infection, they will prescribe an antibiotic.Monitor yourself for any unexplained symptoms, and seek emergency care if you experience any of the following:Severe headache, stiff neck, or pain when you bend forward.
Swelling in your throat.
A new skin rash, especially if it’s getting worse quickly.
Sensitivity to light.
Confusion, irritability, hallucinations, or severe weakness or listlessness.
Vomiting that won’t stop.
Chest pain or trouble breathing.
Abdominal pain or pain when you pee.
Muscle weakness, stumbling, slurred speech, or changes in your vision, touch, or hearing (this could indicate problems with your nerves, brain, or spinal cord).
Seizure.

, Mild fevers in children might indicate a more serious problem.If your child is feverish but is playing normally, is eating and drinking well, and has a normal skin color there’s little cause for concern.However, call or visit your child’s doctor if your child:Is listless, irritable, or won’t make eye contact with you.
Vomits repeatedly or has other symptoms causing discomfort, like severe headache or stomachache.
Has a fever after being left in a hot enclosed space like a car – seek emergency care right away.
Has a fever lasting over 3 days (for kids 2 years and older)
Has a seizure. It’s not abnormal for some children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years to have seizures if they have a higher temperature (these are called febrile seizures). These look scary for parents, but are usually harmless and do not indicate the child has a seizure disorder.Take the child to the doctor to determine the cause.

Call emergency services if the seizure lasts over 10 minutes., Infants who get a fever should be treated very cautiously. Take your baby to the doctor right away if they:Are 3 months or younger with a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) or higher.
Are ages 3-6 months with a fever over 102°F (38.9°C), or lower but are irritable or lethargic.
Are 6 months to 2 years old and have a fever over 102°F (38.9°C) for longer than a day, or have other symptoms like a cold, cough, or diarrhea.
A newborn with any fever or a low body temperature – infants don’t regulate their body temperature well and might get colder rather than warmer when they’re sick (under 97°F/36.1°C).

Make an appointment with a doctor.,
Prepare your medical history.,
Take a physical exam.,
Take a cognitive exam.,
Undergo lab tests if necessary.,
Ask about brain scans.,
Ask about genetic testing.",How to Test for Dementia1," The other sections on this page contain tests which you can take at home. These can give you a little information if you have no other options, but they are not a good replacement for a doctor's diagnosis, according to the Alzheimer's Association., Some drugs, medical conditions, and family history (indicating genetic problems) can put you at higher risk of dementia. Others mimic some symptoms of dementia, such as memory loss, but can be reversed if the doctor discovers the cause. Be ready to give your doctor the following information:Your diet, alcohol use, and drug use. Bring the bottles of any medication you are taking.
Other known medical issues.
Changes in your behavior (especially related to social situations or eating habits).
Which of your biologically related family members have had dementia or dementia-like symptoms, if any.

, Since dementia can be caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, the physical checkup should include a blood pressure reading, taking your pulse, and a temperature measurement.Your doctor may also test your balance, reflexes, and eye movement, or perform a variety of other tests depending on your exact symptoms.

, There are many types of mental exams used to test for dementia, some of which are included in this article. Some common questions include:State the day, month, and year.
Draw a clock face at twenty past eight.
Count backward from 100 by 7s.

, If your doctor does not request blood samples or other lab tests, you might want to ask about thyroid hormone tests and vitamin B12 tests, since these are common tests that can potentially narrow down the cause of your symptoms.There are many other tests that could be requested based on your specific medical history, but those are not necessary for every patient.

, If you are showing some symptoms but the cause is not clear, the doctor may recommend a brain scan to investigate possibilities besides dementia. CT scans, MRI scans, and EEG tests are the most common types of scans used to help diagnose dementia-like symptoms.If your doctor is considering an MRI, let her know about any implants or alterations that cannot be removed, such as tattoos, replacement joints, pacemakers, or shrapnel fragments., Genetic testing is controversial, as even a gene linked to increased risk of dementia does not necessarily mean you will be affected. Still, if there is a history of dementia in your family, especially early-onset dementia, a genetic test could be useful to you or your doctor."

Do not take this test if you are not fluent in the language it is being given in, or if you have a learning disability or dyslexia.Visit a doctor instead.

, The person who has possible dementia-like symptoms just needs to listen to instructions. A second person reads the steps below, and gives instructions or asks questions directed at the person being tested. Take note of how many points the test-taker earns for each section. At the end of the test, add up the scores in each section. Any score of 23 or below (out of 30 total) suggests possible cognitive impairment, which could indicate dementia or other health issues.


No calendars should be visible during the test.
Usually, 10 seconds are given to answer each question, with 30–60 seconds for questions involving spelling, writing or drawing.

, Ask the person suspected of dementia the following questions, one at a time, in order. Score one point for each correct answer.


What year is it?
What season is it?
What month is it?
What is today's date?
What is the day of the week?

, Ask where the person is currently located, in five separate questions. Score one point for each successful answer to the following:


What country are you in?
What state are you in? (Or ""province,"" ""territory,"" or similar term)
What city are you in? (Or ""town"")
What is the address of this house? (Or ""What is the name of this building?"")
What room are we in? (Or ""What floor are we on?"" for hospital patients.)

, Name three simple objects (for example, ""table, car, house""), and ask the person to repeat them immediately after you. You must say them all together, with pauses in between, and the test-taker must also repeat them back to you all at once. Also, tell them that you will ask them to recall these words in a few minutes.


Score one point for each word successfully repeated on the first try.
Keep repeating the three objects until the test-taker succeeds. Do not score any points for successes after the first try, but write down the number of repetitions it takes for the test-taker to remember all three objects. (This is used in some expanded versions of the test.)

, Spell the word WORLD (""W-O-R-L-D""). Then ask the test-taker to spell the word WORLD backwards. Score 5 points if he succeeds within 30 seconds, and 0 points if he does not.


Some medical professionals find it helpful to write down the exact response the test-taker gives to this question.
This step should not be translated into another language directly. Try to find a version of the MMSE in that language to see what word is usually used.

, Ask the person to repeat the three words you told him to memorize earlier. Score one point per word remembered.

, Point to a pencil, and ask ""What is this called?"" Point to a wristwatch, and repeat the question. Score one point per correct answer.

, Ask the person to repeat the phrase ""no ifs, ands, or buts."" Score one point if he succeeds.


This is another step that cannot be translated directly to other languages.

, Ask the person to follow a 3-step command (3 points). For example, tell the person to take a piece of paper in their right hand, fold it in half, and put it on the floor.

, On a piece of paper, write ""close your eyes."" Pass the paper to the test-taker, and ask him to follow this command. Score one point if he does within ten seconds.

, Ask the person to write any complete sentence. If it includes a noun and a verb, and makes sense, score 1 point. Spelling errors do not matter.

, Sketch a geometric design on a piece of paper: one pentagon (five-sided figure), with a second pentagon overlapping on one corner. Ask the test-taker to copy this design on his own piece of paper. Score one point if he succeeds in matching the following characteristics:


Two shapes, both pentagons
An overlap that creates a four-sided shape (or however many sides your original figure had).

, If the test-taker scores 23 or below, visiting a doctor is recommended. Do not attempt to tell the test-taker what the results mean, if you do not have medical training in this area.


If the results are 24 or above, but symptoms are still concerning, try taking the MoCA test as well.

Purchase either regular table salt or sea salt.,
Put a 1/2 teaspoon (2.5g) of salt into a cup.,
Add 8 ounces (1 cup) of hot water and stir well.,
Depending on your situation either cleanse, submerge or gargle the saline solution.",How to Make a Saline Solution1," Do not buy fancy, scented, coloured or flavoured salts; the salt needs to be as pure as possible. Make sure it's iodine-free and lacks preservatives -- if it's anything but salt it could irritate your skin/nasal lining / whatever you're using it for.;
, You want to mimic the concentration of salt or tears by creating a normal (the actual term) solution that's 0.9% saline. 1/2 tsp is about right for fine table salt, but not for coarse sea salt, where the volume needed to obtain 2.5 g can be up to twice that of fine salt.For kids, stay on the less-salty side; for adults, a bit saltier is okay. But just a bit!


If you like, some recipes say to add 1/2 a teaspoon or so of baking soda.However, a normal solution doesn't need it.
This is for 8 ounces of water. If you're using more water, use more salt.

, Zap it in the microwave for a minute or so, set it in your kettle, or otherwise somehow get it to a point where it's hot but not boiling. You will need to run the microwave significantly longer than 1 minute to ensure sterility. Using a covered pyrex bowl works more quickly, but the top may become displaced by buildup of steam if heating is prolonged. Grab a spoon and help it dissolve.


Make sure it's stirred well! If it's cloudy or dirty, throw it out.
If you want to be extra careful, use distilled water (or water that has actually reached a boil). This makes sure everything is sterile and hygienic., But make sure not to swallow it! For the record, it's not intended for open wounds, either.


For piercings, do not submerge in water. Cleanse the area only, as the saline solution can leave the surrounding areas quite dry. Speak to a licensed professional for the best way to care for your new piercing.
For nail infections or other skin related infections (not open wounds) submerge the appendage in the saline 4 times a day. This method can take days to weeks to work, see a medical professional before it spreads, and if you see a red line traveling up your appendage go to the ER.
For a sore throat gargle morning and night, do not ingest the solution, though doing so by mistake will not harm you. If the sore throat persists after 2 days see a doctor.

"
"
Place 1 cup of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt into a pan.,
Bring to a boil for 15 minutes.,
Use your solution.,
Pour the rest into a sterile jar, bottle, or cup.",How to Make a Saline Solution2," That's 8 ounces of water and about 2.5 grams of salt. Make sure the salt is iodide-free and lacks preservatives, coloring, scent, or any other fancy stuff that's unnecessary.


1/2 a teaspoon doesn't seem like much, does it? For adults, it's safe to add a bit more, but just a bit. You want to have a solution that's similar to your own tears -- that's 0.9% saline.

, Place the lid on from the start. If you do not use a lid, too much of the water will boil away and the solution will be too salty. Set the timer and walk away. If you need to prep something else at this juncture (like a neti pot or jar), do so now.

, The most common use for saline solution is to clear the sinuses, help a sore throat or to rinse contact lenses. Just make sure it's safe and appropriate for whatever means you want to use it for.


If you're gargling it, wait for it to cool down a tad so it doesn't burn your throat -- it should be very warm -- not searingly hot. Same goes for using it in your nasal passageway or on your skin; you don't want to exacerbate your problem!

, If you have extras that is. Make sure your container is sterile to ensure the solution stays effective. You can be sure it is by boiling it, too.

Pay more attention to what you already smell.,
Train your nose.,
Get plenty of exercise.,
Talk to your doctor about nasal sprays.,
Get more zinc and vitamin B12 in your diet.,
Note how certain smells make you feel.",How to Improve Your Sense of Smell1," People often say ""use it or lose it"" about muscles, but the same can be applied towards the senses. The more you use your senses, the better you get! Learn how to describe smells. You might even want to keep an olfactory journal! For extra practice, have someone hold various things to your nose while you're blindfolded and see if you can identify the smells.









Next time you are drinking a cup of coffee take time to really breathe in the smell before you drink it. When you are about to bite into some strong cheese, be sure to smell it before eating it.
If you regularly smell things before consuming them, you can help improve your sense of smell over time.;
, As well as being more attentive to the smells you encounter in everyday life, you can go further and adopt a training regime for your sense of smell. Begin by simply choosing four smells that you are fond of, such as fresh coffee, banana, soap or shampoo, and blue cheese. Then each day take a minute to go through and smell each one individually to stimulate the receptors inside your nose. Try to repeat this four to six times every day.








There is evidence that visualizing smells can help to improve your sense of smell. Take a minute to imagine your favourite smells.When you are trying to identify a particular smell you may find it useful to smell with a shallow sniff rather than a long deep inhalation., Studies suggest that our sense of smell is sharper after exercise. The causative link is uncertain, but it has been reported that the sense of smell appears to be better after exercise.Exercising enough to work up a sweat at least once a week has been connected to a lower risk of the sense of smell diminishing as you get older.









This could be because exercise improves brain functions or because it contributes to better general health., If your sense of smell is impaired by obstructive disorders such as congestion or hay fever, allergies, sinus infection, or nasal polyps, it will be necessary to treat the underlying issue in order to improve your sense of smell. Talk to your doctor about nasal steroids, which may help clear your nostrils and help you breathe and smell better., Hyposmia (the medical term for an impaired sense of smell) is sometimes linked with a deficiency in the mineral zinc, and a deficiency of vitamin B12 in vegetarians.To boost your sense of smell, try eating zinc-rich foods, such as oysters, lentils, sunflower seeds, pecans and consider taking a multivitamin supplement that contains at least 7 mg of zinc each day.







, The nerves that sense smell are directly connected to the emotional part of your brain, leaving your rationality out of the equation. Studies found, for example, that the smell of fast food wrappers, fresh bread or pastry increase the likelihood of road rage; peppermint and cinnamon improve concentration and decrease irritability in drivers; and lemon and coffee promote clear thinking and high concentration levels in general.

Avoid foods that cause excess mucus production.,
Steer clear of substances that can impair your sense of smell.,
Stay away from stink.",How to Improve Your Sense of Smell2," Have you ever noticed that your sense of smell fades, or perhaps completely disappears, when you have a cold? Congestion in the membranes in the nose that contain the smell-sensitive nerve endings can dull your ability to smell, and avoiding foods that promote stuffiness (generally dairy products like milk, cheese, yogurt and ice cream) might help. Gradually re-introducing these foods one-by-one will help you to identify which have the biggest impact.








There is a channel from the back of your throat to the sensory cells in your nose. If this channel is blocked by any kind of congestion, your ability to taste food will be affected., Various pollutants such as chemical fumes can interfere with your sense of smell. Smoking is one common example of a substance that can compromise your ability to smell. Quitting could help you recover a better sense of smell.Your smell will be most diminished in the thirty minutes after smoking a cigarette.









Various drugs can hamper your ability to smell. These includes stimulants, depressants, antibiotics and other drugs. If you think you are taking something that might be impairing your sense of smell, contact your doctor.Some cold remedies can make you lose your sense of smell.Be sure you don't stop taking a prescribed course of drugs without talking to your doctor first.

, There is a suggestion that prolonged exposure to bad smells tends to numb your ability to smell. For example, someone who works with compost everyday might over time become less sensitive to the odour.Try to avoid prolonged exposure to strong smells, and if you do have to be around them, consider wearing a mask over your nose and mouth. Wearing a mask can help filter out some of the smells.

"
Understand the causes of a diminished sense of smell.,
Evaluate your sense of smell.,
Know when to visit a doctor.",How to Improve Your Sense of Smell3," There are numerous potential causes of a loss of sense of smell. These include damage to the mucous membranes lining the inside of your nose and obstructions to your nasal passage. Damage to mucous membranes can occur when you have a cold, flu, or suffer from hay fever or sinusitis. These are the most common causes of a loss of smell and are generally temporary.


Obstructions, such as nasal polyps, can cause problems with smell and may in some cases require surgery.
Damage to your brain or nerves can also affect your sense of smell. A head injury can result in a loss of sense of smell., Before you consider going to the doctor, you can ask yourself some questions to begin the process of evaluating the deterioration of your sense of smell. The answers to these questions will help the diagnosis if you do go to a doctor. Start by asking when you first became aware of the loss of smell, and then ask yourself about the conditions under which this occurred.


Was this a one off experience or does it recur? If so, what links the times when it does recur? Were you suffering from hay fever at the time?
Did you have a cold or flu at the time?
Had you suffered a head injury?
Were you exposed to pollutants or substances such as dust to which you may have had an allergic reaction?, Short-term changes in your sense of smell are relatively common, if you have a cold for example, but if the problems persist and your smell doesn't return you should make an appointment with your doctor. If necessary your doctor will refer you to a specialist who will test you and give you a diagnosis.You may be asked to smell specific odours in a paper booklet, and the specialist may perform an endoscopic examination of your nose.


It may not seem the most serious health problem, but your sense of smell is important and you should visit the doctor if you have concerns.
If you are unable to smell be especially careful with any gas appliances and be sure not to eat any food that has passed it's best before date.
Problems with your chemical senses can be an early sign of more serious conditions including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.
Smell disorders can also be related to hypertension, obesity, malnutrition and diabetes."

Direct your attention to your cervical spine.,
Work your sciatic nerve.,
Take care of upper back pain by applying reflexology to the points that correspond to your upper back and shoulders.These points are located at the base of your toes, at the top and bottom of your feet.",How to Relieve Back Pain Through Reflexology1," You can treat lower back pain by applying pressure to the reflexes on the soles of your feet, the entire area around your heel and around your ankle, as well as the inner edge of each foot—the reflex points for your spine are located along the inside edges of your feet. You can treat upper back pain by applying reflexology to the reflex points for your shoulders and upper back, which are represented on the soles and tops of your feet just beneath the base of your toes.
, A simple massage and ankle rotation can help prepare your legs for reflexology treatments.Use gentle but firm pressure and massage your calves, ankles, soles of your feet, and toes. Flex your foot forward and backward, and then rotate your foot to loosen up your ankle.

Massage the lower arch-edge of your foot for 5-10 minutes. This area corresponds to your lumbar area and will help relieve general back pain.

, The spine reflex points follow the line of the inside edge of your foot; these reflex points are not on the sole of your foot.Support your right foot with your left hand and use your right thumb to work all of the spine reflexes that are located along the inside edge of your foot, from the tip of your big toe all the way to your ankle.
Starting at your toe, press your thumb firmly into the skin and move slowly along the whole length of your foot so you are sure to press every reflex spot.

, The reflexes for the sciatic nerve are found just behind your ankle bone and continue up in a straight line for about 4"" or 10 centimeter (3.9 in).Sciatica causes searing pain down the leg because the nerves are compressed, which can be triggered by a number of factors. Working the sciatic nerve reflex points will improve the blood supply to this area. Working the sciatic nerve reflexes every day for a few minutes is a great way to prevent a painful case of sciatica.


Use your index finger and thumb to press gently on the area. Move your finger and thumb back and forth, bringing them together and then sliding them apart.,


Apply pressure with your thumb to the area just beneath the base of your toes, first on the sole of your foot and then on the top of your foot.
When you work the sole of your foot, you can also press your knuckles deeply into those reflexes.
Use a lighter touch for the same reflex points located on the tops of your feet because that area is more bony and sensitive.

Use hand reflexology for convenience.,
Contact the reflex points for your spine.,
Work the reflexes that correspond with your shoulders and upper back.",How to Relieve Back Pain Through Reflexology2," Sometimes, you may not have time to take your shoes off and perform a full foot reflexology treatment. You can use hand reflexology instead. You can also use hand reflexology if your feet are injured or infected in any way., You can do this by applying pressure with your thumb along the outside edge of your palm. Work on your right hand first and then switch to your left hand., You can do this by applying pressure to the area just beneath your pinky and ring fingers on the top of your hand.On the palm of your hand, the area for your shoulders and upper back is located just beneath your pointer and middle fingers. There is also a reflex point for the upper back on your palm just below the base of your thumb, on the outside of your hand.
Always work the reflex points on both hands; your left shoulder reflexes are at the base of your left pinky and your right shoulder reflexes are at the base of your right pinky.

Recognize childhood infections that are contagious.",How to Tell when You Are Contagious," A normal temperature range is 97.7 to 99.5°F (36.5 to 37.5°C). Anything above that is considered a fever and indicates that you are probably contagious. Having a fever with a cold is not as common as the fever associated with the flu, but either way it means you are contagious.


Running a fever is your body’s way of fighting off the infection. Body temperature can be measured orally, rectally, in the ear, or under the arm, and may vary slightly with each method. The fever associated with the flu can range from 100 to 102°F (37.8 to 38.9°C), and even higher in children. Expect the fever caused by the flu to last for three to four days in most cases.Body temperature is regulated through a structure in your brain called the hypothalamus. When you have an infection, the hypothalamus increases body heat to help get rid of the invading virus or bacteria.;
, Thick or discolored yellow/green mucus is a strong indication that you have an upper respiratory infection accompanied by inflammation in the respiratory tract. It also means that you are most likely contagious.


Children with thick white, yellow, or green drainage from their eyes usually are contagious as well, with ""pink-eye"" also known as conjunctivitis.
Specific respiratory illnesses that involve thick or discolored mucus and nasal secretions include the common cold, sinusitis (inflammation of the sinus), epiglottitis (inflammation of the epiglottitis), laryngitis (inflammation of the larynx, and bronchitis (inflammation of the bronchus).
The immune system increases the production of mucus in your nose to flush out the illness. This causes your nose to feel clogged, and indicates that you are contagious.
Thick or discolored mucus that does not clear in about a week may warrant seeing a doctor. Your doctor can do tests to evaluate the cause of your symptoms, order treatments such as antibiotics, and determine if you are contagious.

, Certain skin rashes are often a sign of being contagious. Rashes that affect large portions of the body may be either allergic or viral. Viral rashes are the ones that mean you are contagious, like with illness such as chickenpox or the measles. Some bacterial infections that are contagious can cause skin rashes, such as scarlet fever (caused by streptococcus) or impetigo (caused by streptococcus or staphylococcus usually). Fungal infections can even cause contagious skin rashes such as ringworm or athlete's foot.


There are two ways that viral rashes can spread. Viral symmetrical rashes start at the extremities, on both sides of the body, then spread towards the center of the body. Viral central rashes start from the chest or the back, then spread outward to the arms and legs.
Viral rashes follow a pattern of spreading, either outward or inward, as just described. Rashes caused by allergies can appear anywhere on the body and do not have a specific pattern of spreading.
Some viral rashes tend to stay in certain areas, such as the Coxsackievirus. When this virus causes hand, foot, and mouth disease, it causes a rash mainly in and around the mouth, on the hands and feet, and sometimes in the diaper area or on the legs.

, Diarrhea can be a sign of having a contagious illness, especially when accompanied by vomiting and a low-grade fever. Diarrhea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever can be signs of gastroenteritis, often referred to as the stomach flu, or signs of rotavirus, norovirus or coxsackievirus, all of which are contagious.


There are two types of diarrhea: complicated and uncomplicated. Uncomplicated diarrhea includes symptoms of abdominal bloating or cramping, loose watery stools, a sense of urgency to have a bowel movement, and nausea and vomiting. Usually, diarrhea involves the passing of stool at least three times a day.
Complicated diarrhea includes all the symptoms of uncomplicated diarrhea plus blood, mucus, or undigested food in the stool, accompanied by fever and weight loss or severe abdominal pain.

, Regular headaches are not usually an indication of a contagious disease. However specific types of headaches (where you feel pain in the face and forehead) can be a warning that you are contagious.


Headaches that accompany the flu, and sometimes a cold, occur as a steady pain in the areas of the forehead, cheeks and bridge of the nose. The swelling and mucus buildup in the sinus areas causes the discomfort. The headache pain can be severe and may get worse when you bend over. Note that bacterial sinus infections are not usually contagious, nor are ear infections.

, When you have a contagious illness, like the flu or a cold, the sore throat is often accompanied by a runny nose. A sore throat without a runny nose but with symptoms such as a fever, rash, or headache, can be a sign of strep throat. This is a bacterial infection which is very contagious.


The sore throat is sometimes caused by postnasal drip, as fluids from your sinuses drip down the back of your throat, causing redness and irritation. The throat feels raw, irritated, and painful.
When the sore throat and runny nose are accompanied by wheezing and itchy, watery eyes, it is likely that you are suffering from allergies rather than a contagious virus. The throat discomfort caused by allergies is still from post-nasal drip, but the throat feels dry and itchy.

, Contagious illnesses can cause you to feel very tired or sleepy, and to lose your appetite. Sleeping a lot and eating less are two ways in which your body conserves energy to fight infection.

, Flu symptoms include fever, headache, general aches and body pain, extreme feelings of fatigue, and sometimes stuffy, runny nose, sneezing, cough, and chest discomfort. Influenza, or flu, symptoms begin more abruptly, progress quickly, and are more severe than symptoms from a cold. The flu also can lead to serious complications.Someone with the flu is contagious for a day or so before symptoms start, then remains contagious for five to seven days once they appear. The CDC considers someone to be contagious until the fever is back to normal, without the help of medication, for 24 to 48 hours. If other symptoms linger, such as problems with coughing, runny nose, and sneezing, then you are probably still contagious. , Typical symptoms that occur with a cold include a sore throat, stuffy or runny nose, cough, congestion, sneezing, mild chest discomfort, fatigue, and some general body aches and pain. Colds are contagious one to two days before symptoms appear, then continue to be contagious for the next two to three days when the symptoms are at their worst.More than 200 viruses have been identified that cause people to catch a cold. This type of upper respiratory illness makes you feel bad, is annoying and uncomfortable, but is not usually associated with serious complications. Symptoms can linger for up to 10 days, but the most contagious time is within the first few days when symptoms are the strongest and when a fever is present.

, Symptom groups such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting accompanied by muscle aches and headaches can mean that you have gastroenteritis, sometimes called the stomach flu, or even food poisoning. Gastroenteritis and food poisoning have similar symptoms. This can make it hard to tell which one you may have. However, the stomach flu, or gastroenteritis is contagious, and food poisoning is not.

, Most contagious illnesses can be caught for one or two days before symptoms develop. Learning what you have caught may be easier by understanding the recent illness of someone you have been exposed to, even if they were not yet sick when you were around that person.Also consider the time of year. Many contagious illnesses are more common during certain times of the year. Flu season in the United States runs generally from November through March. Other diseases may be specific to certain countries or regions. Plus, seasonal allergens can vary depending on where you live., Some people have strong upper respiratory symptoms that are caused by seasonal airborne allergens. This type of illness is not contagious. Allergy symptoms overlap with those of a cold and the flu.


Allergy symptoms include general weakness, stuffy, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat and coughing. People with allergies often have a lot of itching of their nose or eyes. While allergy symptoms can make you feel bad, you are not carrying a contagious illness. Your doctor can help by ordering lab tests that identify the cause of your allergies, and by prescribing the appropriate course of treatment. At first, it can be difficult to tell the difference between the symptoms of a cold, the flu, or seasonal allergies. After a day or so, the symptoms change. How fast they change and additional symptoms that develop can help you determine if your symptoms are from a contagious illness like a cold or the flu, or if the symptoms are caused by airborne seasonal allergens which are not contagious. Allergies are caused by an overactive immune system. Certain substances such as pollens, dust, animal dander, and some foods, trigger the immune system to fight them off as if they were harmful substances in our body.
When that happens the body releases histamines to fight of the perceived intruders. Histamine creates symptoms common to a respiratory infection, such as sneezing, coughing, runny nose, nasal congestion, itchy and watery eyes, sore throat, wheezing and headaches.

, Scientists research and develop flu vaccines that are designed to prevent infection from the most likely strains of flu viruses. Every year the vaccine is different, so getting it one year does not protect you for the next round of flu season. Getting the flu vaccine is key in controlling the spread of the flu.The flu vaccine protects you from the flu, not from other contagious illnesses you may be exposed to.

, Upper respiratory illnesses, like a cold or the flu, are spread from person to person. A common way these illnesses are spread is by touching someone or something that has been contaminated with the virus. , Wash with warm water and soap placed in the palm of your hand. Lather your hands by rubbing them together for at least 20 seconds. Be sure to cover all surfaces of your hand, including between your fingers, under your nails, and your wrists. Then rinse your hands well, use a paper towel to dry, and use a towel to turn off the faucet. Discard in the towel in the trash can.germs off your hands by wash

, Squirt gel into the palm of your dry hand. Rub your hands together covering all surfaces until the gel dries. This takes about 15 to 20 seconds., The flu virus can be spread by someone sick as far as six feet away. Coughing and sneezing creates tiny droplets that can travel through the air, landing on someone’s hands, their mouth, nose, or inhaled directly into their lungs., Door knobs, desks, pencils, and other objects can carry the virus germs from one person to another. Once you touch an object that has been contaminated with the virus, it is easy to then touch your mouth, eyes, or nose. This provides a way for that unwanted virus to enter your body. The flu virus can live for two to eight hours on surfaces., If you get sick, avoid contact with other people until your symptoms improve or your doctor says you are not contagious.In the United States, estimates show that between 5% and 20% of the population get the flu every year. More than 200,000 people are hospitalized each year for complications and, each year, thousands of people die. The elderly, babies, pregnant women, and people that have compromised immune systems, or have asthma or other lung diseases, are at the greatest risk of developing complications. Protecting yourself from exposure, and preventing exposure to other people if you do get sick, can possibly save lives., Try to stay in an isolated room at home, separate from other family members (especially kids) to avoid spreading the illness. Don't go to work or school, and don't send your children to school or daycare when they are contagious., Coughing and sneezing into a tissue, or even into the bent part of your arm near your elbow, is better than spreading the infected droplets into the air., Bed sheets, towels, dishes, and utensils should be washed carefully before being used by other people.

, While the flu and the common cold are certainly experiences most people have, there are many other contagious diseases, some of them serious, that should not be overlooked. Your doctor, or other healthcare provider, is a great resource for any illness or symptoms that develop that might be contagious., Some forms of hepatitis are contagious, as are some forms of meningitis. These conditions are serious and should not be ignored. If someone you know has been diagnosed with an infectious disease, consult your doctor to help determine if you are at risk., Most children receive vaccinations in their early years to avoid contracting serious illnesses, but sometimes contagious diseases can still be a problem. Discuss any evidence of infection or illness with your doctor or your child’s pediatrician. "

Monitor your sleep in the last six weeks. Have you noticed a difference? Do you sleep significantly less?


Use sleeping pills with caution. Their usefulness is debated and there are accidental deaths linked to them. Never use them without talking to your doctor.
There are several reasons for which you might not sleep. Make sure your mattress is good and your bedroom dark. You should also talk about your sleeping problems with your doctor. You might be suffering from a condition such as sleep apnea.;
, You don’t deal with stress as well as you used to and you feel more fragile. Each deadline is a source of major anxiety and you don’t know how to cope anymore. If you notice a negative evolution in your stress tolerance, it's probably time to act.


A lower tolerance to stress than usual is usually a sign of exhaustion or burnout.Don’t feel guilty and don’t lose faith in your ability to work if you’re more stressed than usual. We all have ups and downs.
If you work in an abusive environment where the boss is using stress as a tool to increase productivity, a day off will not help. You should talk to your trade-union or HR and see if the law is on your side.

, Those who know you the best, your family and friends, will probably notice if you're in desperate need for a break. Talk with them about your stress and ask them for their opinion. If you have a strong relationship, they will give you the best advice.Remember that communication is fundamental in a relationship. If you have been fighting with your partner recently, explain that you feel pressurised at work and are struggling. Let your partner express his/her feelings too. It’s important to realise that a stressed person is difficult to live with., A day off is ideal to relax but not enough when you have a serious physical or mental condition. You should talk to a doctor or a specialist if you suspect a depression or any other health issue.


Identify the signs. If you feel sad and down for weeks or months, you might be depressed. Depression is a real illness and has nothing to do with being weak.If you notice any unusual symptom, such as a rapid loss of weight, go immediately to your doctor.

, Plan your mental health day during a slow time at work. Make sure your day off doesn’t bring stress on others. Check the calendar and your schedule to ensure your day off works for everyone.


Pick a Friday or a Monday if you don’t work during the week-end. Three days without working can do miracles.

, Instead of saying that you are stressed, just tell your boss that you have a few important personal appointments or matters to address and would like the day off from work.


Be calm and confident in your approach and reassure him/her that you will have your work covered and/or deadlines met in time.
Don’t pretend to be sick. If your boss doesn’t believe you, you might be in trouble.
Don’t tell co-workers or clients that you need a mental health day. Some people are unfortunately intolerant toward health issues.
Find a co-worker to back you up if there is an emergency at work and you’re needed.
Consult with human resources to figure out how to categorize your day off. In some cases, the company may have actual mental health days built into your benefits - another reason why you should not feel guilty.

, You might want to make the day off about you and only you. It shouldn’t be about fetching the little one at school or buying nappies. Discuss the planning in advance and make sure that everybody will respect your peace and quiet.


Offer to do more for the household before or after your day off to compensate. The key is respect and understanding.
Tell your family not to call you on your mental health day, except in case of emergency.
If you want, it’s also perfectly fine to spend your day with your family. It’s all about what you want!

, You want to make sure that your day off work is as relaxing as possible. A bit of preparation will help considerably. Make sure that you have all you need in advance. You don’t want to get stuck in a line at the supermarket’s cashier on your day off.


Make a list the day before and go buy what you need. Buy the essential, such as food and drinks, but don’t forget things that might make you happy.
Make a schedule of your day and fit in priority what you would really want to do.

, It’s better not to have any work at hand for your day off. Leave everything at your office place. Turn off your phone and avoid your emails.Make a resolution that you will not work and truly commit to taking your mental health care day seriously.


If you want to keep your phone turned on, make sure to turn off the emails to avoid any temptation.

, If you've been exhausted or not sleeping, your day off should be spent in bed, resting your body and brain. You don’t need to sleep the whole time if you don’t want to, but you should definitely allow yourself to rest a few more hours than usual.Don’t forget to disconnect the alarm.
Once you're awake, take a long and warm bath to relax your muscles.
If doing chores and housework will make you feel a little saner on your day off, go for it. A mental health day doesn’t mean that you have to just sit around relaxing. In some cases, restoring order to your surroundings will bring you to a place of peace.

, You’ve been working so much that you have eaten your sandwiches in front of your computer for the last four months. It’s time to go to a restaurant and enjoy a lazy lunch with a friend.


Go for a healthy meal and don't eat too much if you don't want to feel sleepy during the whole afternoon., Office work is stressful for the body and the spirit.There are several activities which will allow your muscles to stretch and your mind to relax. Here are a few suggestions:


There’s nothing like sport to make you spend some energy and stretch in a fun way. Try to pick a sport you like and avoid injuries!
Go for a massage to feel truly relaxed and pampered.
Aromatherapy is a good alternative. It is relatively cheap and can make you feel very good.

, If work has taken you away from the ones you love, spend the day making time to be with those important folks. For example if you’ve been working endless hours, seven days a week and haven’t had a chance to spend time with your daughter, plan an entire day around what she wants to do.


You can also combine a few nice activities at the same time. Why not having a go at a good restaurant with your friends before heading for a massage with your family?

, If you're a workaholic, you will probably feel uncomfortable or guilty during your day off. Brush this feeling aside. Everybody deserves a day off once in a while and should be allowed to relax.


Remember that you need to care for yourself in order to continue being a productive worker and present parent/ family member.
Things at the office will not fall apart if you're gone for one day.
Getting a break can help you refuel and regain creativity to approach new problems.

Put your energy into the most essential tasks.",How to Maintain Your Health when Caring for Sick Loved Ones," Culturally, it's more acceptable to put the needs of others first. However, when it comes to being a caregiver, sometimes you need to take care of yourself. Part of that is figuring out what is stopping you from caring for yourself.For instance, you may feel selfish for putting your needs first. However, if you make yourself sick, what good will that do for the person you're caring for?
Maybe you have trouble asking for help, meaning you take on the full burden of caring for the person. However, everyone needs some help when it comes to caregiving, so don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
Give yourself permission to put your needs first at times, so you can be helpful to your loved one.;
, Everyone has a range of emotions when it comes to caring for a loved one. Guilt, remorse, grief, resentment, anger, and anxiety are all common emotions, and it's important to acknowledge and accept those feelings.It's also a good idea to find someone you can talk to about them, who's willing to listen to what you're going through without judgment.Consider seeing a therapist with whom you can process the emotional toll of caregiving.

, Reach out to other caregivers, such as in a caregiver support group. Just listening to others' stories and telling your own can make you feel better. You're not alone in this situation. Others are going through it, too, and they can help support you through it.If you don't have time to go to an in-person group, consider finding one online. You can check in whenever you have the time., If you usually have an active spiritual life, try to nurture that side through prayer, meditation, or whatever you like to do. Generally, if you neglect a spiritual practice you normally do, it can make you feel unbalanced or out-of-sorts.


If you don't pray or meditate, consider taking a few moments out of each day for yourself, just to sit quietly or even write in a journal, so you get in touch with how you are feeling., You need to take a bit of time each day doing something you enjoy that relaxes you. Doing so will help you maintain your sanity and health. Plus, if you're more relaxed, you'll make a better caregiver. Just find something small that you enjoy, and try to incorporate it into your day.Maybe your break could be a short walk outdoors or a few minutes spent doodling., Sometimes, you just need to hang out with your friends and have a good laugh. If you can, try to take a break to go out with your friends or family. You'll be able to feel more like yourself, instead of just a perpetual caregiver., Only you know how much of your time and yourself you can give to caregiving. That means it's important for you to set limits with yourself. You also need to express those limits with doctors, nurses, and other caregivers, so they're aware of when you will and when you won't be there., In a time when things seem out of control, you may neglect to focus on good eating habits. You may not eat much, or you may end up eating junk food. Both of those put a strain on you. Try to eat as healthy as you can, even if you have to order food in sometimes or rely on simple meals like salads.Remember to include lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, and veggies in your diet.

, Sleep can also be difficult when you're caring for a loved one. You may be too worried to sleep at times, or the task of caregiving may interrupt your sleep. However, try to get as much as you can, aiming for a regular 7 to 9 hours a day, even if you have to do it in smaller chunks. Not getting enough sleep can put a strain on your health, plus it will make you less effective as a caregiver., Exercising will also help you maintain your health while you're caring for a loved one. As an added bonus, it can reduce your stress level. However, it can be difficult when you are caregiving, so you'll need to find ways to work it into your schedule.For instance, maybe you can take a short walk a couple of times a day. You could also do yoga at home or try jumping rope.
You could also ask someone to come sit with your loved one while you take an hour or so to go exercise. That way, you get a much-needed break, plus the exercise you need.

, It can be easy to overlook signs of health problems in yourself when you’re caring for someone else. However, if you become sick, you won't be able to help your loved one, so it's best to stay on top of health problems. In fact, the best plan is to maintain your regular doctor's visits and dental checkups to make sure you're in good health., Before you can ask for help caring for a loved one, you need to figure out where others can plug in. Take some time to list everything that needs to be done to care for your loved one. Try not to leave anything out.After you make the list, think carefully about what you can realistically do on your own without burning out. Now, look at what others could do to take the burden off of you.

, Remember that you cannot do it all. It is okay to ask for help. Most of the time, people want to help in whatever way they can. However, they may need help figuring out what you and your loved one need. Talk to each person (friends and family) individually to help get your needs covered.You could say, ""I know you care about Jane. I was wondering if you'd be able to help out a bit. I could really use someone to bring dinner some nights.""
Try to offer a task to the person that fits with their skills. Alternatively, ask them what they'd like to do to help, especially if they offer.

, If your loved one has a long-term serious illness, professional help is often needed. Respite care is a great option for getting help and giving yourself a break from time to time. Maybe your loved one needs to be in a long-term care facility or spend time at an adult daycare a few days per week that has the capability of providing care for your loved one.Maybe you will keep your loved one at home, but you'll need to hire help to come over and provide some care for your loved one. Either way, having a professional around can help take some of the burden off of you.Some communities offer volunteer respite care workers who can come and care for your loved one for a few hours so that you can take a break. You can learn more about respite care for older adults through your local Area Agency on Aging.When considering professional help, you may need to do some persuading when it comes to your loved one. That is, some people don't like the idea of having outside help. However, most people will concede when they realize that you can't do everything yourself. If your loved one is particularly against the idea, you may need to have someone who's been in the same situation (as a caregiver or a professional) come talk to the person.
When deciding who to hire, first look at the kind of care you need help with. For instance, you may need non-medical assistance, to provide things like bathroom assistance and even things like cooking and cleaning. Medical care, such as home healthcare, helps with things like providing medications and need to be ordered by a doctor.
Some in-home health may be covered by programs like Medicare. Make sure you ask what your insurance covers when looking for professional help.
If your loved one is suffering from a terminal illness, hospice may be a good option for you, which can provide care for your loved one, if he or she has 6 months or less to live.

, Many community services provide some type of care for people who are ill, particularly if they are ill or homebound. For instance, many communities have meal delivery services, such as Meals-On-Wheels, at no cost to the person to help you feed them.Also, consider organizations the person is associated with. For instance, veterans may be entitled to some benefits. Members of Elk and Mason lodges may have some care provided. Also, church members are often willing to step up when members need care. Don't be afraid to look at all your resources.

, That is, consider which tasks you could find ways of not doing yourself, such as ordering meals in or hiring a cleaning service. These services wouldn't require people coming in as much as professional caregiving help, but they would help relieve some of the pressure on you."

Test your blood for various non-life threatening reasons.",How to Get a Blood Test," The best person to determine if your signs or symptoms demand a blood test is your doctor. If you need one, she will prescribe it and provide you with a blood work order.


If your doctor orders blood work, make sure you have it done as soon as possible.
If you’re afraid or anxious about the blood work itself or the potential results of the blood test, talk to your doctor. She can reassure you — the best way to treat what is causing you heath issues is to identify the problem. The results of your blood test can help you begin proper treatment.
Make sure to listen to and talk to your doctor about any special instructions and things you may need to do before the blood is taken.;
, You might need your blood work ordered for non-medical purposes. One of these purposes is to ascertain if your diet and nutrition is what it should be to support your overall health. In this instance, consult a nutritionist and see if he wants to order blood work to determine your vitamin and mineral levels and to find out if you have any deficiencies that should be addressed. You might consult a nutritionist in the case of:Pregnancy
The advice of a medical professional
You have diabetes, absorption abnormalities, and/or food sensitivities/allergies
If you are a vegetarian, vegan, or subscribe to any other non-traditional diet

, If you're an athlete, suffer from certain muscular problems, or have suffered some sort of muscular injury, your sports medicine doctor might also order blood work. Blood work can tell your sports medicine doctor a lot of information about muscular health and potential problems like arthritis and similar afflictions. Ultimately, your sports medicine doctor will be the best person to decide if you need blood work related to skeletal and muscular health., Naturopathic specialists or doctors combine natural remedies and medical science to treat an array of afflictions. Depending on the reason you are consulting a naturopathic specialist, he or she might order blood work to help them determine how to treat you. Naturopathic doctors might order blood work in order to help them determine:Gluten intolerance
The treatment of headaches
Hormonal imbalance
An array of other problems

, Today, many labs are increasingly allowing individuals to have their blood drawn and tested without an order or prescription from a medical professional. If you for some reason want to have your blood tested, you may be able to find a lab that will test your blood without any blood work order. For more information, contact local blood testing labs in your area. Just because you have this option, however, does not mean you should do it; getting your blood tested without the help of a medical professional is not recommended. Consider the following:


If you order your own blood work, you won't have the ability to have a doctor interpret it for you and then prescribe a treatment, if needed. Many tests need to be interpreted by a medical professional.
Information on the internet is not always credible. You may want to get your blood drawn and use information you found online to interpret the results but, this is not a reliable way to read test results.
Even if you read the test results correctly, you may be unable to get the treatment necessary without a doctor to write a prescription.
Some labs only offer a handful of blood tests without a doctor-prescribed blood work order.
This service might not be available in your area., Depending on the type of blood work your doctor or other medical professional has ordered, there are a number of things you need to do to prepare for the test. This is necessary to make sure that the diagnostics performed on your blood provide accurate data. Some preparations could include:


Not eating or drinking for up to 12 hours.
Discontinue use of certain medications.
Other preparations as ordered by your doctor., After your doctor has evaluated whether you need blood work or not, take your prescription to a hospital or lab. You’ll likely wind up at a specific lab that specializes in collecting blood work and other specimens from people. The lab will either run the blood there or send it off to a central location for testing. , When you are called in at the lab or hospital, a phlebotomist (a person trained to extract blood from patients) will sit you down and may ask you questions. Cooperate with the phlebotomist. She is not there to cause you trouble or to harass you. The phlebotomist is just doing her job. Questions she might ask you could be for a variety of reasons, including:To verify your identity
To find out if you have allergies to latex
To calm you down or relax you

, When the phlebotomist goes to take your blood, you need to relax your arm. Try to stay relaxed, otherwise the phlebotomist will have a tougher time finding your vein and taking your blood. Staying rigid and not relaxing could cause unneeded pain to yourself and exacerbate an already uncomfortable situation.

Do not clench your muscles.
Your palm should be facing up.

, After you relax your arm, the phlebotomist will then draw your blood. Ultimately, this is the moment you've been waiting for. The actual blood being drawn won't take too long, so relax.


The phlebotomist will locate a vein from which to take blood, then clean the area with an alcohol swab.
The phlebotomist will create and tie a tourniquet on the arm to help blood collect.
The phlebotomist will position the needle at a 15 degree angle and stick it into your skin.
You'll feel a slight stinging, but nothing significant.
The blood being drawn will take from 30 seconds to a couple of minutes, depending on how much blood and how many samples (tubes) the phlebotomist needs to take., As the phlebotomist is drawing your blood, try to avoid doing things that might cause you anxiety, and push negative thoughts aside. If the sight of blood makes you feel faint, don’t look at the blood being drawn out of your arm. If you’re fascinated by it, feel free to look. Just remember, this is a normal and necessary procedure that needs to be done to determine your health. The blood drawing procedure itself won’t hurt you.Close your eyes and hum if that helps.
Think about something else if you get anxious.
Joke with the phlebotomist or talk about anything but the fact that blood is being drawn out of your arm.

, It is recommended that most people have blood work run every year or two to monitor their blood levels and other vitals. As a result, blood work is often ordered as a part of routine annual physical exams. Ultimately, blood work is one of the only ways to determine if a person’s health is stable or failing. Some important levels that bloodwork monitor include:


Blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels can indicate the onset of diabetes or other metabolic disorders and diseases.
Cholesterol levels. Cholesterol levels are indicative of cardiovascular system health.
Red and white blood cell levels. These are indicative of your overall immune system’s health., Often times doctors will order blood work if you have been ill and they have been unable to identify the cause of your illness or if you have been experiencing pain and the source cannot be identified. In this case, blood work will help your doctor figure out what is causing your sickness or pain and then prescribe the appropriate medication or treatment to treat you. , One reason why you might need blood work is if you’ve somehow been exposed to a viral or bacterial contagion. In this event, your doctor will order blood work in order to determine if you’ve contracted an illness and what type of illness you have contracted. Some examples of contagions that a doctor might order blood work for include:


Hepatitis
Mononucleosis
Bacterial infections — A blood test might be able to help your doctor determine what bacteria is causing your sickness.
Other rare viral infections

, Sometimes people exhibit signs or symptoms of life-threatening diseases or other ailments. One of the only ways to determine if you’ve contracted one of these diseases is to have blood work done. Such ailments include:Cancer
Diabetes
Thyroid disease
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Pancreatic malfunction
Gall bladder dysfunction

, Sometimes doctors or employers will have blood work ordered in order to determine if employees have taken illicit drugs or other controlled substances in the recent past (though a urine-based DNA gas analysis test is usually more accurate and commonly used). In the case that an employer orders a test, he will refer the employee to a doctor who will order the blood work. Blood tests can detect many types of controlled substances, including:Amphetamines
PCP
Marijuana
Cocaine
Opiates

, Doctors will order blood work for a variety of non-life threatening reasons. Ultimately, there are a large variety of reasons a doctor will want to order blood work. As the best indicator of overall health and genetic makeup, blood tests are invaluable for such monitoring. Some reasons include:


Testing for pregnancy
Testing for vitamin or mineral deficiencies
Genetic testing
Thyroid level testing
Amino acid level testing

Try to behave like an educated person, no matter how you feel.,
Share your knowledge.",How to Become Self Educated," A curious mind seeks to be educated. By asking questions, you can find out a lot of things that many people don't know and won't ever know.


There is no limit to how many questions you can ask, or should ask.
Be aware that some people are annoyed by questions. In fact, the less a person knows, and the less patient a person, the more a question will bug that person. That in itself tells you a great deal.;
, Try to expand your mind by learning beyond your comfort zone and seeing how other people think, perceive and understand things.


If you only ever see rom-coms, go and see a documentary or an action film instead.
If you only ever read comics, try a novel instead.
If you only ever see car rallies, go and see a museum exhibition instead.

, Curiosity is about pushing yourself beyond what you're used to. There will be times when you feel really uncomfortable, out of your depth and perhaps even upset when trying to learn new things. This can happen especially where you feel dumb, unlearned or when your beliefs and values are challenged. These are the very times when you should keep pushing yourself to learn and to become wiser about whatever it is you've been avoiding.

, Read English from different parts of the world, don't assume that authors from your own country are the only ones worth reading. By extending your reading to elsewhere in the world, you'll discover that even with one language, the thinking is diverse and the ways of seeing the world are wonderfully varied.


When you feel more competent in this area, push into other languages. Realize that learning a language is about immersing yourself in another culture too.

, If you're learning or have learned the basics in math, science and other subjects, find out what you've yet to learn and set about teaching yourself. There is much more beyond the basics and most of it will challenge you in much more interesting ways than your initial learning did.


If you did badly at a subject, do not let this hold you back. Every brain is plastic and capable of being rewired to relearn things and to learn new things. Tell yourself that not being able to do math, chemical equations or spell are just things from the past that you can remedy in the present. Then set about doing so.
Many textbooks for college and high school are useful starting points when teaching yourself or refreshing on the basics. Use these to get you on the right track, then extend your learning beyond them.

, Without fail, always read something, and make it substantial.


Read world history and learn about different cultures. Understanding history is a key to understanding the present. It is one of the finest ways of self-educating.
Read about others who self-educate. You will get a lot of tips and ideas for how to continue your own journey of self-improvement.

, Self-education requires very good self-discipline. You won't have people chasing you to meet deadlines, to get the answers right or to do your studying. It's all down to you and you'll need to keep yourself motivated. In itself, developing self-discipline is a very crucial part of self-education.

, There are many ways to do this, all while continuing to self educate:


Associate yourself with educated people, groups, discussions.
Join a course or college to get a degree or few certificates at least.
Audit college level subjects. That means, no exams, just all pure learning. Soak it up.
Attend conferences, seminars, talks, etc. Just being among other people can give you a buzz, all while learning.

, They have lived through it all and have amazing memories of the things that were. You can, and will, learn a lot from them if you just take the time to sit with and listen to them.


Should you feel that what they tell you is old hat and odd, put aside your biases and really listen. There are authentic human things to learn from older people, regardless of where modern technology sits at any one time.

, Join a MOOC (multi-online open course) or similar online learning courses. Many of these are free and will really push your learning beyond the simple. You can even interact with other peers learning and get and give feedback.

, Borrow from these people what you consider works well to improve the mind and understanding.Observe,learn and apply what you see good from them.

, Who inspires you? Who has said and/or done things that really made you sit up and listen and want to do too? These are the people who make a difference in life and you can make use of their inspiration to further your own learning and relevance.

, Self educating yourself in religion is an important way to understanding the deepest beliefs and feelings of humanity. Aim to learn all that you can about every religion and show all faiths respect.

, Research unearths many answers but many people do not have the patience or tenacity to be good researchers. This skill is a great one to develop, as it will empower you to find out many things, from the simplest (such as what time the library stays open until on the weekends) to the most complex (why do stars die?). But all the in between stuff matters too, the things that make the wheels of everyday life turn, such as resolving neighbor disputes over property lines, knowing how to get the local government to fix broken playground equipment and learning how to get an audience with your government representative. Knowing how to research the answers will give you a lot of handy answers to those questions that the curiosity you've been asked to cultivate with bring forth.


When researching or finding out something new, if you ever have the question 'why' or something related to that to a particular subject, then search up on it.

, Try to act, then learn from your failures.

, Make people aware that you know things through the way in which you converse and the way in which you interact with your fellow citizens. By being an informed and active citizen, you can make a positive difference to everyday lives and may even get engaged enough to help push through changes within your own community.

Check your face for a butterfly rash.,
Note any mouth or nasal sores.,
Look for symptoms of inflammation.,
Pay attention to your urine.,
Note any problems with your brain and nervous system.,
Ask yourself if you are more fatigued than usual.,
Watch for other strange things in your body.",How to Diagnose Lupus1," An average of 30 percent of lupus patients develop a characteristic rash over the face often said to look like a butterfly or wolf bite. The rash spans across the cheeks and nose, often flaring out over the entirety of the cheeks and occasionally covering a portion of skin near the eyes.Also check for discoid rashes around your face, scalp, and neck. These rashes show up as red, raised patches, and they can be so severe that they leave scars even after they’re gone.
Pay special attention to rashes triggered or worsened by sunlight. Sensitivity to ultraviolet light, whether natural or artificial, can trigger sores on sun-exposed parts of the body and may worsen a butterfly rash on your face. This rash is more severe and develops faster than a usual sunburn would.;
, If you frequently get sores on the roof of your mouth, along the side of your mouth, on your gums, or inside your nose, this could be another warning sign. In particular, this is often the case if these sores are not actually ""sore."" In most cases, mouth and nasal sores associated with lupus are pain-free.If these sores get worse in sunlight, this is an even stronger sign of lupus. This is called photosensitivity.

, Inflammation of the joints, lungs, and the lining around the heart commonly occurs in patients who have lupus. On top of this, blood vessels are usually inflamed.Most notably, you might see inflammation and swelling around the feet, legs, hands, and eyes.If you have inflamed joints, they may feel warm and tender and look swollen and red.
Inflammation of the heart and lungs can be detected at home based on chest pain. If you feel a sharp chest pain when you cough or take a deep breath, you can count this as a possible symptom. The same applies if you feel shortness of breath during these periods.
Other signs that your heart or lungs could be inflamed include abnormal heart rhythms and the coughing up of blood.Inflammation can also take place in the digestive tract and can be spotted through symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

, While urine abnormalities can be hard to detect at home, there are a few symptoms you might be able to detect. If a kidney is unable to filter your urine due to lupus, your feet might swell. Worse yet, if your kidneys have begun failing, you might feel nausea or weakness. , Lupus can affect the nervous system. Some symptoms, like anxiety, headaches, and vision problems, are common and difficult to assign to lupus; however, seizures and changes in personality are concrete symptoms taken very seriously. Note that while headaches are very common with lupus, they can be very difficult to attribute to the disease. Headaches are common and have many possible causes.

, Extreme fatigue is another common symptom of lupus. It can be caused by a number of different factors, but often these factors can be linked to lupus. When fatigue is accompanied by fever, you may be even more certain that it is lupus., You may notice that your fingers or toes change color (white or blue) when exposed to cold. This is called Raynaud’s phenomenon, and is common with lupus. You may also notice dry eyes and shortness of breath. If all of these symptoms occur together, you may be dealing with lupus."

Continue your education.",How to Become an Adoption Consultant," In order to work in a consulting role with an adoption agency, most states will require that you have at least a master's degree. For undergraduate study, you can pursue your degree in social work, but you can also consider related fields such as psychology or family counseling.;
, During your undergraduate career, you will take courses on human behavior and development, social welfare, and the economic and political conditions of social crises like poverty and homelessness. Maintain at least a 3.0 GPA and foster professional relationships with your professors. Consider working with professors who focus on child and family welfare and adoption counseling. Many MSW programs will want to see that you have completed a statistics course as well, so you should consider taking that for your math requirement.


You should also pursue an internship or volunteer with an adoption agency so you can experience the daily administrative workings of the agency. Always maintain a helpful, compassionate and professional attitude. Show your supervisors that you are serious about this line of work: you're not just an intern, you're a future colleague.

, For your master's degree, find a program that offers field work opportunities with multiple adoption agencies so you can get a diverse range of hands-on experience. This will be crucial experience in order to find work in a supervised position after your graduate.


Consult your undergraduate professors and your college's career center for help on applying to MSW programs. Most MSW programs require a 3.0 GPA, GRE scores, 3-4 letters of recommendation and a 1-3 page application essay in order to be admitted. Your career center or college writing center can help you draft and revise your application materials so you will be a competitive candidate for the program.
Make sure that your MSW program is accredited by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE). There are more than 238 accredited MSW programs in the U.S., After you complete your MSW program, most states will require that you spend 2-3 years working in a board-approved supervised position related to your field; the requirements vary from state to state, but you will generally have to complete 3,000 hours. Draw upon your professional network of professors, supervisors, and other colleagues as you embark upon your job search. You should use your supervised work experience to decide if you want to work with a public agency and place children in the foster care system with adoptive families or if you would prefer working with licensed private agencies.


Public adoption agencies often work with adopting children in the foster care system to families who can meet their needs. Licensed private agencies often work with families who are interested in adopting healthy infants. Some states will contract with private agencies to facilitate adoptions from the foster care system. , Many states require that adoption counselors have earned a license as a clinical practitioner in addition to earning a MSW. Earning this license will generally require passing an exam distributed by your state's chapter of the Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB).You will need to contact your state's chapter of the ASWB in order to get approval to register for the test. You can find more information on gaining your license hereThe clinical exam distributed by your state's ASWB chapter is a four hour, 170 multiple choice question test. It will cover a range of clinical practice questions on human behavior and development, diagnosis and assessment standards, and the ethical standards of that state's chapter of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW). It is graded on a pass-fail basis; you will generally need to correctly answer between 93-106 questions in order to pass.
You will need to study over an extended period of time for the exam; do not cram for it in the few days before the test. Set a clear schedule over a period of weeks and months and use study guides such as the one provided by the ASWB.Your graduate university or your state's chapter of the NASW may also offer study courses for the clinical licensing exam.
If you fail the course, most states require that you wait 90 days before re-taking the exam. The ASWB will give you an outline of your test explaining which areas need the most improvement., There are many routes you can take as an adoption counselor. You might consider working as a counselor for adoptive parents or as an advocate for the birth parents of the child. Your previous field work and supervised work experience should be your guide in selecting specific positions for application.

, Birth parents often experience a range of emotions during the adoption process including grief, fear and loss. Helping your clients cope with these emotions will be an important component of your work.You might also consider working with birth mothers or birth parents who are unsure if they want to pursue adoption. You can inform them of their options while also providing them information on the process of adoption. Governmental departments such as Health and Human Services and non-profits like Planned Parenthood often help connect these adoption counselors to birth mothers., As a counselor in this role, you will help adoptive parents navigate the often long and complex process of adoption. You will need to make sure they are aware of the many options they have in pursuing adoption (with public, private or international agencies) as well as preparing them for any potential obstacles during and after the adoption process.

, By working with a public adoption agency, you will be helping children in the foster care system who are sometimes older. You will also work as a counselor to both the parents and the child as they transition from the foster care system to the adoptive home. If you work in a private, licensed adoption agency or an international agency, you are more likely to work with infants and parents who are interested in adopting infants.

, If you are working as a consultant with an adoption agency, you might be required to visit the home of the prospective adoptive parents and assess it according the state guidelines and/or the requirements of your licensed private agency.In addition to assessing the physical condition of the home, counselors conducting home studies will also need to evaluate the emotional state of the adoptive parents, including their concerns and anxieties as well as their general views on parenting and family life.

, After working as a consultant with an adoption agency, you might want to consider advancing into an administrative role with your agency, such as an Executive Director or Operations Director. In this more advanced role, you would ensure that your agency meets all state-level licensing standards for child-placing agencies. This will give you a well-rounded sense of how an agency operates and will allow you to evaluate the adoption process from the perspective of everyone involved: the biological and adoptive parents, the child, the individual counselor and the broader administrative goals of the agency.


You should work in this advanced role for at least 2 years in order to see if you would like to continue at this level of responsibility in your own agency. As you take on more responsibility, you will become a public representative of your organization. You should focus on connecting your agency to other important groups that work in family welfare, child development at the state and federal level.

, After taking on significant responsibility at your former agency, you might wish to create your own agency. The requirements to open your own agency will vary from state to state, but you must ensure that you are meeting all of your state's licensing and certification requirements. Your state's licensing requirements are usually distributed by the Department of Family and Social Services or a similarly named entity.Starting your own agency will require having things like a business plan, a marketing calendar and a workable budget. You can find a guide to coming up with these kinds of materials here.You will also want to collaborate with domestic and international adoption agencies as you set up your own business; draw upon your professional network for support as you embark upon this new venture.
Seek out highly qualified staff to make up your new agencies. Consider offering mentorship programs to new counselors and consultants so they have a strong professional network in your agency.

, As you move into more administrative roles, you might consider pursuing certifications in project management or master's degrees in non-profit administration, public administration, or other management specializations. You could also consider pursing a Ph.D. in Social Work if you are interested in conducting research on adoption.


Many social workers with a Ph.D. focus on issues of public policy; if you have an interest in researching adoption policies and making recommendations for improving these policies, then the Ph.D. will be a fruitful route to explore. If you have an interest in teaching social work at the college level, the Ph.D. will also be an important credential for getting that position.

Inquire about a biopsy.",How to Diagnose Lupus2," You can go to any general physician for a lupus diagnosis, but that doctor may refer you to a rheumatologist who may order more confirmatory tests and help manage symptoms with specific medication for lupus. Typically, though, the start of a professional medical diagnosis will be at a standard physician's office.Before your appointment, write down information about when your symptoms began and how frequent they are. Also make a note of any medications and supplements you take as possible triggers.If a parent or sibling has ever had lupus or another autoimmune disorder, you should bring that information with you as well. Patient and family history are very important for diagnosing lupus.

, ANA is an antibody that attacks proteins in the body, and these ANA are present in most people with an active form of lupus. This is often used as an initial screening test; however, not everyone with a positive ANA test has lupus. Further tests are needed to confirm the presence of lupus.For example, a positive ANA test can also indicate scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, and other autoimmune diseases.

, This blood test measures the amount of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and hemoglobin in your blood. Certain abnormalities can be another possible sign of lupus. For example, this test can reveal anemia, which is a common symptom of lupus.Note that this test does not diagnose lupus by itself. Many other conditions can also cause similar abnormalities.

, Your doctor may do several tests that confirm an inflammatory condition, though they will not definitively prove you have lupus. One such test measures your erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). This test measures how fast it takes red blood cells to settle at the bottom of a test tube in one hour. A fast rate can indicate lupus. A fast rate can also be symptomatic of other inflammatory conditions, cancers, and infections, so it is not an absolute test, either.Another test that is non-specific for lupus but can test for inflammation is a C-reactive protein (CRP) test. This liver protein can indicate the presence of inflammation, but there are many other conditions that can cause this protein to show up.

, Since no blood test is exclusive to lupus, doctors usually perform a range of blood tests to narrow down the diagnosis. Symptoms usually must match at least four out of the main eleven symptoms that doctors look for.Other possible tests your doctor might use include: A blood test measuring your erythrocyte sedimentation rate. This test measures how fast it takes red blood cells to settle at the bottom of a test tube in one hour. A fast rate can indicate lupus. A fast rate can also be symptomatic of other inflammatory conditions, cancers, and infections, so it is not an absolute test, either.An antibodies to phospholipids (APL ) test. An APL test looks for antibodies that attack phospholipids, and they tend to be present in 30 percent of patients with lupus.
An antibodies to Sm test. This antibody attacks the Sm protein in the cell nucleus, and it is present in about 30 to 40 percent of lupus patients. Moreover, it rarely shows up in people without lupus, so a positive result almost always guarantees a lupus diagnosis.
An anti-dsDNA test. Anti-dsDNA is a protein that attacks double-stranded DNA. Roughly 50 percent of lupus patients have this protein in their blood. It is very rare in people without lupus, so a positive result almost always results in a lupus diagnosis.
Anti-Ro (SS-A) and Anti-La (SS-B) tests. These antibodies attack the RNA proteins in your blood. It is more common in patients with Sjögren's syndrome, however.

, Urine tests monitor the kidneys, and damaged kidneys can be a sign of lupus. You might be required to provide a urine sample so that the doctor can do a urinalysis. This test looks at your urine for extra proteins or the presence of red blood cells., Your doctor might order an imaging test if they think that you have a form of lupus that affects your lungs or heart. A traditional chest x-ray might be ordered to look at your lungs. An echocardiogram will look at your heart.A chest x-ray can reveal shadows in your lungs, which could indicate areas of fluid or inflammation.
An echocardiogram uses sound waves to measure the beating of your heart and to detect possible problems in the heart.

, If your doctor suspects that lupus has damaged your kidneys, they may do a kidney biopsy. The goal of this biopsy is to obtain a sample of kidney tissue. They will assess the condition of your kidneys based on how much damage has occurred, and what kind of damage it is. Doctors can use this biopsy to determine the best treatment for lupus."

Learn what lupus is.,
Understand the three primary types of lupus.,
Identify the causes.",How to Diagnose Lupus3," Lupus is an autoimmune disease, which means that it causes the immune system to attack healthy parts of your body. Again, it mostly affects the organs, such as the brain, skin, kidneys, and joints.The disease is also chronic, which means it lasts for the long-term. It causes the body to become inflamed as the immune system attacks healthy tissue. There is no cure for lupus; however, treatments can ease the symptoms.

, When people refer to lupus, they usually refer to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This type of lupus affects your skin and your organs, especially your kidneys, lungs, and heart. There are other types of lupus, including cutaneous lupus erythematosus and drug-induced lupus.Cutaneous lupus erythematosus only affects the skin and does not threaten the other organs of your body. It rarely develops into SLE.
Drug-induced lupus can affect the skin and your interior organs, but it is induced by the use of specific medications. It usually goes away once those medications are out of the patient's system. The symptoms associated with this form of lupus are typically rather mild.

, Although it has been difficult for doctors to understand lupus, over time they have identified its characteristics. Lupus appears to be triggered by a combination of your genes and your environment. In other words, if you have a genetic predisposition for lupus, environmental factors can trigger it.Common lupus triggers include medications, infections, or contact with sunlight.
Lupus might be triggered by sulfa drugs, drugs that make you more sensitive to sunlight, penicillin, or antibiotics.Physical conditions that can trigger lupus include infections, the common cold, a virus, being exhausted, getting an injury, or emotional duress.
It is the ultraviolet rays from sun that can trigger lupus. Ultraviolet rays from fluorescent light bulbs can do the same thing.

Create a blog.",How to Become an Autodidact," To become an autodidact, you’ll need a few supplies. Learning doesn’t happen in a vacuum; you need some tools to help you along the way. To start off, get a notebook, pen, and maybe a nice cup of coffee.Get a small notebook that you can bring with you everywhere. This will be useful to write down observations or ideas as well as topics for further study as you think of them.
You’ll also want easy access to the internet. This is a great source of information, so having a smartphone or some kind of device that allows you to access the internet whenever you want to look into a topic will help you become an autodidact.;
, Ask yourself why you are learning about a certain topic, how much you hope to learn, and when you want to finish. This is an important step as actually putting this information down on paper would make the plan more concrete and push you to keep at it without giving up.Chart out how many hours a day you can set aside for learning and try and stick to the timetable. You could do weekly assessments and see if the timetable is effective and reevaluate if it isn't.

, You must decide on what to focus on. Knowledge is vast and it is not possible to learn everything. Select smaller sections of topics to begin with so that you can easily acquire all the knowledge on that given subject. Once you have mastered this piece, then you can move on to another topic or to a more inclusive view of a larger subject.For instance, if you are planning to learn history, then it would be best to pick a time period or a particular country. This way you can concentrate on certain aspects and not be bogged down by the magnitude of information.
Choose topics that you are passionate about.

, There are many learning resources available like books, the Internet, documentaries, and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). It is not realistic to expect yourself to learn by being constantly involved with all these resources. So, pick one or a combination of the resources for yourself.For example: to learn about the government of India, you could choose ten books and a MOOC. Or you could learn only with books. Or you might want to go through articles and essays available online.

, With this method, you’ll essentially be studying a topic by learning about it from different perspectives. To begin, you’ll need to make a list of books that relate to a certain topic you’re interested in studying.You could begin compiling your list of books by searching for the topic on websites like Goodreads or Amazon.

, It doesn't matter which book you read first unless you have a specific order in mind from the offset. For example, you may want to start with a book that offers a broader view of the topic before getting into more nuanced aspects of the subject. When you are finished with that, move on to the next book on the list. This is how swarming works. You reading everything on a certain topic from different authors' perspectives.If you decide to start studying the Civil War, you might want to begin with a book that gives a broad overview of the war in general before moving on to books that discuss individual aspects of the war like the Battle of Gettysburg or the problems with Civil War prisons.

, Note taking allows you to process the information you gathered while reading. This way you can question yourself about how well you understood the topic and also remember pertinent information.Maintain a glossary in your notebook for words and concepts related to the subject you are learning about.

, You should be constantly adding to your reading list on a topic as you encounter new sources of information. If you want to read everything written about a topic, you’ll need to be on the lookout for new material to enlighten you.You could decide what to read next either from the works cited in a book you finished or from a new Google search. Or you might choose what to read next based on some new concept you read about in the last book.

, Many colleges and universities offer Massive Open Online Courses, which are free online courses you can register for to learn about various topics and subjects. They are offered in various languages and at various times in order to reach the widest audience possible.Enroll in as many MOOCs as you can on your desired topic and engage fully in the course. Do all the readings and participate in online discussions for the class. This is a great, free way to learn more about a subject.

, Watching documentaries allows you to see some of the information dramatized. They can also give you more clarity on what you already read or might read in the future and help you remember it better. You can get documentaries at your local library or through a service like Netflix.There are many documentaries that offer visual depictions of historical events that will help you to visualize the topic more clearly.
There are also many historically accurate films you can watch to broaden your understanding of a topic.

, Another great way to learn about a subject is by watching TED talks. TED is a nonprofit organization focused on the fields of Technology, Entertainment, and Design which hosts talks intended to spread ideas on innovative subjects. The invited speakers are usually leaders in their field and have some new take on a subject or some inventive idea that they speak about in their short presentation.You can search the TED talks website by topic, category, speaker, language, date, or keyword. So it is easy to find something informative on the topic you wish to study.

, One of the best ways to learn about a topic is by going to the place where it actually happened or where there is some kind of monument or official location celebrating the subject.For example, if you’re interested in learning about French culture, consider spending some time in France so you can experience the culture firsthand rather than just read about it.
You could also visit museums dedicated to your topic. For example, if you are studying the life of Ernest Hemingway, you could consider visiting the Ernest Hemingway Museum in Oak Park, Illinois, or the Hemingway House in Key West, Florida.

, Sometimes official organizations have newsletters that they send out to subscribers interested in their topic. They usually cover news regarding the topic, upcoming events that might be of interest to followers, and other important updates related to the subject.


Such newsletters might be sent out biweekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.
For example, if you are interested in studying American literature, you might consider subscribing to the Modern American Literature (MLA) newsletter or the American Literature Association (ALA) newsletter, or even an author-specific newsletter like the Walt Whitman Review or the Henry James Review.

, Jot down any ideas you might have about the subject before you start learning. When you are in the middle of learning about your topic, try to brainstorm and summarize your knowledge again to see what you’ve taken away about the topic so far. And when you have finished reading everything you want to about the subject, take stock of your new knowledge by brainstorming again.This will help you synthesize all of the knowledge you’ve acquired, but it will also allow you to keep track of how far you’ve come during the process.

, As you are learning new things, it’s important that you write them down so that you can refer back to them at a later date. This will allow you to maintain your new knowledge more effectively. Reading something once won’t necessarily make it stick in your mind forever, but the act of writing and reviewing a piece of information will help log it in your long term memory.Write down interesting facts you learn and your observations about them. You can take notes regarding where the information came from – giving the name of the book and page number in case you want to go back to the original source later.

, Another good way to keep track of your newly attained knowledge is by keeping it organized in some kind of online forum. This way, you’ll have access to it wherever you are – even if you leave your notebooks at home.Invite your friends to read them and comment on it. You could start up a discussion there. The best way to learn something is to share your knowledge with others.

, According to a number of studies, people who eat high quantities of garlic are at a reduced risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as:


Colon cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. It may also be beneficial in the treatment of prostate and bladder cancer.It is believed that the allyl sulfides found in garlic may be responsible for these benefits.

, Garlic can be used to prevent and treat colds, as it is packed with antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal properties.


It also contains a large number of antioxidants, which boosts your immune system and help your body to fight off the cold virus.
Garlic can also help to shorten the duration of existing colds by helping your body to fight off the cold virus. Try drinking a garlic-infused tea flavored with honey and ginger.

, Garlic is also a popular ingredient in a vast array of home remedies, such as:


Soothing psoriasis. Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, garlic is sometimes used to relieve psoriasis outbreaks by soothing inflamed skin.
Clearing acne. Garlic helps to dry out large pimples and kill bacteria on the surface of the skin.
Treating athlete's foot. Garlic's anti-fungal fungal properties make it effective treatment for athletes foot.
Healing cold sores. Garlic's anti-inflammatory properties help to reduce redness and swelling, shortening the duration of cold sores., Make sure the garlic is fresh and from a good producer. The fresher the garlic the better the benefits.

, Put the rest of the garlic in a container in the pantry or freezer to keep it fresh. The fresher it is the more minerals and vitamins are in it and that will provide many more benefits.

, Fresh garlic needs to be prepared in a particular way in order to maximize its health benefits.


Separate the cloves and remove the skin from each, then crush or chop the garlic and leave it to sit for 5 minutes before using it in your cooking.
This sitting period allows an important enzymatic process to take place: a phytonutrient known as alliin is converted into allicin, an active compound which is responsible for the majority of garlic's health benefits.
After the 5 minutes are up, the garlic should be eaten or used as quickly as possible as the allicin will quickly become inactive.
During cooking, add crushed or chopped garlic near the end of cooking time to retain the most flavor and nutritional value.

, Garlic is an extremely versatile herb, and can be used in a wide variety of recipes. Try using garlic in some of the following ways:


Add fresh garlic to salad dressings, salsas and butters to add a fiery and pungent flavor.
Add a few cloves of garlic to trays of roasting meat or vegetables to add a milder, more aromatic garlic flavor.
Use chopped garlic as a base in sauces, soups and casseroles for improved flavor."

Amara is run on a nonprofit basis, and while it is used by TED, it is available for all types of video subtitling. Amara is designed to be easy to use, with the combined length of all four training videos clocking in at less than five minutes. The videos will explain to you how to type, sync, review, and translate, and they are located at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NxoPqYwVwo&index=1&list=PLjdLzz0k39ykXZJ91DcSd5IIXrm4YuGgE.

, There’s no limit to how many TED talks you can transcribe or subtitle. However, you can only transcribe or subtitle one at a time, and you need to finish each TED talk you translate within 30 days. Also, you have to translate at least 90 minutes of material before you can review and grade other translator’s material., TED translation is an open-source project. That means, like Wikipedia.org or wikiHow.com, that anyone can participate, and correction is outsourced to the TED translation community. So while you can submit anything you like, it is subject to review. Expect to be corrected on your mistakes!

Network with other academics.",How to Become an Academic," Someone who pursues an academic career often works at a university or research institution in a specific discipline such as biology, history, or political science. If you like studying, writing essays, and teaching, academia might be a good choice for you.Investigate your job options. It’s increasingly difficult to find permanent or tenured jobs in academia.Knowing that you can get an advanced degree and work for government agencies or other public and private institutions such as museums, might help you make your decision.
Studying, taking part in academic conferences, and teaching something about which you are passionate can be incredibly rewarding and make academic seem less like a “job.”;
, If you think you want to be an academic, consider meeting someone who is already one in the your desired field or discipline. She can tell you about the realities of academia, answer questions you have, give you tips for getting started, and guide your goals for the future.Inquire how she got into her academic career. Ask about her education and/ or any professional or practical experience she had. If you like studying and striving for specific goals, academia might be a great option for you.

, Consider how being an academic fits into your life.Factors like your goals, time, location, potential demands, and salary can inform your decision and guide your career path. You might want to ask yourself some of the following questions:


How deep is my commitment to this field?Am I willing to potentially move often and continue applying for jobs that may only be for a year?
Am I able to work in an unstructured environment and self-start projects? Working on studies often requires developing your own topic and doing your own research.Are there emotional demands? Academia is very competitive and one can encounter a lot of rejection.It can take a long time to find a permanent position in the field as well.In addition, working with a university faculty can require navigating delicate personal and political situations.
Does being an academic fit your personality? Working with potentially competitive colleagues or navigating different types of students can be a significant part of academia. If you’re interested in working solely as an academic researcher, you may spend a lot of time by yourself in an unstructured environment.
Ask yourself if you’d like to teach and work with students or just with other academics in places like a think tank or government office.How much money will I make? How much academics earn varies according to the discipline and type of job. For example, a full professor will make considerably more than an adjunct professor or lecturer.The amount can also differ according to your experience and job location.You should also be aware that there is strong competition for academic positions in every discipline., You have to finish your Bachelor’s degree to pursue a PhD, which is generally the education requirement for a career in academia.Take classes in the discipline that you’d like to be an academic to give yourself an advantage of getting into graduate programs and make attaining your PhD somewhat easier.


Consider majoring in your preferred academic discipline or one closely related to it. For example, if you want to be an animal behaviorist, you could major in ethology or comparative psychology.If you want to be a historian, you could consider anthropology or philosophy.
Take courses that complement your preferred field of specialization. For example, if want to be an archaeologist, consider classes in history and anthropology.

, Most academic positions require a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) once you’ve finished your Bachelor’s degree or Master’s degree.Having the right degrees ensures to you—and potential employers-- that you have mastered the required information to pursue a career in academia.


Pursue your PhD. Since most academics teach and do research at universities or colleges, you will need a graduate degree. Most institutions require a PhD, though some institutions and disciplines may only require an MA or MS, or even professional experience.Inform yourself about different programs in your specific discipline. Different universities have different disciplines and fields in which they specialize. Figuring out which universities offer the type of degree and experience you want can optimize your educational experience.For example, if you want to be an animal behaviorist, you might want to find specific programs in this field or related fields. Likewise, if you want to be a historian of Europe, you’d want to figure out the best programs for that instead of for American history.Make sure your degree granting institution is accredited, which assures that the quality of your education meets acceptable levels. The US Department of Educations provides a list of accredited universities., Most academics conduct original research and then publish it. Starting with a dissertation and including articles, books, or other media, research is often the bread and butter of any academic.Be aware that the point of “scholarship” is to expand current knowledge of your particular field.
Make sure your research is original and that no one has used your specific topic or method of analysis before you begin. This will require that you master the scholarly literature related to your field.
Choose an area that hasn’t been explored in depth. For example, you could look at something like the impact of wars on the practice of humanitarian aid.Make sure to get any permissions or clearances you need to do your research, especially if it requires using human or animal subjects.
Take copious and detailed notes, as this will help you write up and publish your research.

, One of the primary components of being an academic is publishing your research findings.In fact, sometimes one will hear the phrase “publish or perish.” Aim to publish your research at a rate commensurate to your field.


Begin publishing your research as soon as it is ready, including if you are still in graduate school.
Ask colleagues and friends about what general expectations for publication within your field are. If you work at a university, there may be guidelines on publication expectations.
Aim to publish with the most prestigious academic presses or peer-reviewed journals in your field as possible. This can help you gain exposure and may help complete your file for tenure.

, Many academics who work at universities conduct research and teach students. Getting teaching experience in your specific and possibly related fields can not only make you attractive to potential employers, but also help you master your field and round out your curriculum vitae.See if your university requires being a teaching assistant (TA) as a part of your graduate studies. Consider volunteering to be a TA in a different field than yours to show your ability to be flexible as an academic. For example, if you work on American history, offer to TA a course on African history. This may help you make connections with your own work as well.
Ask if you can teach independent courses in your field.
Volunteer to teach courses that may be less popular. The more diversified your teaching experience is, the more attractive you may be to potential employers.

, Depending on your chosen discipline, consider getting an internship or job that will enhance your coursework with practical experience. Ask if your university or college can help you find internships or jobs that complement your studies.


Be aware that many graduate programs and employers, particularly in health fields or the sciences, may require internships or practical experience to graduate or start a job.Consider doing an internship complementary to your field. For example, it may be difficult to find an internship as a historian or archaeologist. But you could intern in a library or archives, which would give you experience in conducting research.
Get different types of experience to give you sense of what work you could do and what kind of work suits you best. For example, you may want to work for your university astronomy lab during the school year and pursue an internship at a local planetarium in the summer.
Many internships and residencies, like universities, are also accredited. The US Department of Education also offers a list of these programs., Whether you are a student or have finished your graduate education, apply for grants and fellowships from your university and outside institutions. Winning grants and fellowships can not only help pay for your research but also attract other organizations to fund you .


Look for grant and fellowship opportunities at different universities and colleges, research institutions, government agencies, or independent groups. For example, if you are a physicist, see what funding opportunities your university, the National Science Foundation, and the European Physical Society offer.Be aware that some institutions will require that you be a member in order to apply for funding.

, Inform yourself about current research in your discipline and specific field, as well as any related fields. You can do this by attending conferences and seminars, reading journals, and networking with colleagues. This knowledge may help you more effectively do your job and can also make you attractive to potential employers.Read journals from your specifics areas of expertise and those related to it. For example, if you work on the history of cultural heritage, you might want to read publications by historians, anthropologists, ethnographers, and archaeologists. Legal journals may also be of use.
Subscribe to journals related to your specific fields. This can help you stay most current on research through articles and book reviews. You may also find job listings in these journals.
Go to conferences for your specific discipline and field. For example, if you are a quantum physicist, you could attend the American Physical Society’s annual conference as well as that of International Quantum Structure Association.Be aware that staying on top of current research can also help your teaching profile.

, There can be a lot of uncertainty in academia.If you wait until you finish your PhD to find a job, you may have trouble securing even a term position.There is intense competition for academic jobs, so the more prepared you are to apply everywhere and often, the better chance you'll have of securing a permanent job.Start researching universities, agencies, institutions, and organizations with which you may be interested in working at least a year before you defend your doctoral dissertation.
Ask your doctoral advisor, professors, colleagues, and friends for advice on where, when, and how to apply for academic jobs.Search job posting on academic Internet databases or job portals, research at your university’s career center, and attend job fairs at conferences to find other opportunities.

, Most academics work at places like universities and research institutions. Because competition for academic positions is strong, apply to as many positions as you can in your field or related fields. This may increase your chances of securing a position.


Prepare yourself for rejection. Competition for academic jobs is very high and it’s very likely you’ll have several rejections. Remember that the decision is not personal but that you’re likely in a pool of other very qualified candidates.Search the websites or publications of professional academic associations every day. New jobs may appear daily.
Check online listserves specific to your discipline or field.
Talk to your advisor, professors, or colleagues if they’re aware of any job openings.
Submit material requested by the position ad. This often includes a cover letter, CV, writing samples, and proof of ability to obtain funding.

, You may prefer a professional position with a business to a job at a university or may not have had any luck on the academic market. There are a multitude of options for academics at places like think tanks, government agencies, or museums.Look for professional positions in academic publications, newspapers, professional recruiting sites, and or by asking headhunters.
Submit letters of interest and ask about career opportunities at places that interest you. See if you can set up an informational interview.

, Meeting and talking with academic colleagues or professionals from your field or related disciplines can expand your ability to find a job as well as increase your knowledge. Go to conferences, establish a local seminar, and join professional organizations to network with fellow academics.


Join organizations in your specific discipline and field. For example, if you are a historian of modern Germany you might want to join the American Historical Association and the German Studies Association.
Go to conferences. Make sure to attend panels related to your work and any social events offered. These can help you meet new people who share your interests.
Set up regular meeting or seminar meeting for colleagues in your field and discipline or related disciplines in your local area.

Be smart.,
Be a good leader.,
Be approachable and friendly.","How to Be Smart, a Good Leader, and an Approachable and Friendly Classmate","



Study! It can be boring, but you need to study if you want to be smart.
Read non-fiction books! You will learn new things by reading informational books. If reading nonfiction books is extremely boring for you, read online articles or just read fictional books and still learn new words.
Listen up in class! You need to be paying attention if you're going to learn anything and become smarter. If you're sitting beside someone that you either usually talk to or he/she is talking in class to the point where you can't pay attention, talk to the teacher about getting a new seat. If your teacher says no, tell the person to be quiet.;
,


In a group project, take charge! Sit down and tell everyone to give their ideas. This way, you'll be able to have everyone speak, and they'll know subconsciously that you are capable of being the leader. After everyone has given their ideas, give your opinion of the ideas and let others speak their opinions. If you are really against the idea, have a vote and see who is for and against the idea. Sometimes, the leader needs to let others get their way. Then, ask the group who wants to do what. If there are two people who want to do the same thing, let someone work on half of the task and the other person do the other. If this is not possible, it's best for either you to choose or to have them simply do rock paper scissors. If there are tasks that no one has volunteered to do, even if you don't want to do it, say you'll do it yourself. If there are more tasks than there are people, take up the extra tasks unless someone else offers to do them. Finally, get everyone's phone numbers so you can call them and be sure they are working on the project and to get a report on how they are doing.
If there is someone without a partner or not in a group, offer to let them join, even if they are a so-called ""loser"". This will make the person feel accepted, and you will, even if it's not at the moment, feel good about this decision.
If there is someone that is not completing their task, don't be afraid to confront them and tell them to get their game on! If there isn't much time left for the person to do their task alone, offer to go over and help them! There's nothing worse than when someone doesn't get their task done and everyone ends up with a bad grade after all the hard work they've done.

,


Give out compliments! Don't tell fake ones, though. Be genuine! They will take you more seriously and feel much better about the compliment you gave them.
Be sure to have good hygiene! Nobody is approachable when they smell! So be sure to brush your teeth twice a day, brush your hair, wear deodorant (very important), and take a shower every day if possible. Also, wear clothes that fit you!
Always have a smile on your face and good posture. A smile makes everyone feel happier, especially if it's directed at them. Be sure it's not fake, though, or they will be able to tell and will feel sad and think you are being ""fake nice"" to them. Good posture tells people that you have confidence, and that makes people feel comfortable around you.

If you're struggling in a particular subject, ask your parents about hiring a tutor. You can also talk to the teacher about the issues you're having and ask for help.;
, Aim for four years of math and science courses in high school. Medical fields require a lot of scientific and mathematical knowledge. Having a good deal of math and science courses on your college application can help you get into a quality school.If your school offers Advance Placement (AP) courses, sign up for these.
In addition to taking high level math and science courses, study hard for any standardized test you take. High marks on the math and science portion of the ACT or SATS can help set your application apart.

, Nurses engage in a lot of hands on work in the hospital. As a CNA, you need to work as a nurse for a set number of years. Therefore, it's a good idea to get some experience working in a hospital setting. Look into volunteer programs at a local hospital to work on building your experience early on.You can call a local hospital and ask if they take volunteers. You can also ask to shadow a nurse for a day so you can learn about the career.
You may be able to get a job in a hospital, even out of high school. You may be able to do basic work, like assisting a nurse with things like cleanup. You may also be able to work in an administrative role, such as working the front desk.

, You want to make sure a CNA instructor is the right career for you.

You will usually receive a Bachelor's of Science in nursing. A four year degree can help you become a better teacher down the road, but may be more expensive. A 2 year degree is enough to become a registered nurse, if money is an issue for you.
You will receive both theoretical and hands-on training during nursing school. You will often take lecture-based classes on anatomy, ethics, and things like adult and newborn care and elder care. You will also learn in a laboratory setting for science courses, and go into a hospital for clinical rotations where you'll practice with actual patients.

, If you want to become a CNA instructor eventually, start gaining experience now. Work on taking on extracurriculars and jobs in college that can help with your CNA instructor application.


As administrative duties are so important to becoming a CNA, you can try to apply for administrative jobs. Try working as a secretary or working the front desk of a hotel.
You should also look for opportunities to teach. Start tutoring fellow students. Ask a professor or teacher whether you can TA for a class.

, After finishing nursing school, you are required to take what is known as the NCLEX-RN exam. This is an exam that tests you on all the basic knowledge necessary to become a registered nursing assistant. Prior to your exam date, study hard to assure you receive passing marks.Read books and articles on how to improve test taking skills, especially if you're prone to anxiety. Test taking skills are key to passing the exam, and going into the exam relaxed and confident can help.

, The night before the exam, get a good night's sleep. Wake up in time to have a healthy breakfast, as you'll want to be alert and energetic for the exam.Try to stay calm in the exam room. Remind yourself it's okay to be nervous, but do not let your nerves inhibit your ability to do well on the test. Take it one question at a time and go at your own pace. Do not worry about what others are doing.
In the event you do not pass the exam, you can retake it. Retake policies vary by states. In some states, you must wait a set period before retaking the exam. When applying for the exam, check retake policies so you will have a game plan ready in the event you do not pass the exam.

, After you pass the exam, contact your state's nursing board. They can provide you with information on how to finalize your license, and also provide information on other requirements your state may have. Specific requirements vary by state. In some states, further action, such as a criminal background check, will be needed to become a registered nursing assistant after passing the NCLEX-RN exam., Requirements vary by state, but in most states you will need to work as a nurse for 2 to 3 years before you can become a CNA instructor. Get a job in a hospital, nursing home, or other place where CNAs are required.Talk to past contacts about employment.

, Make the most of your employment as a nurse. You should work towards gaining experience that will make your CNA instructor application stand out.


Look for leadership experience. If you volunteer for a local organization, take on leadership roles there. If there is some kind of organization of CNAs in your hospital, take an active role there.
You should also look into teaching experience. You can return to your nursing school and volunteer as tutor or work as a TA. Much of your work as a CNA instructor takes place inside the classroom, so teaching experience is vital to doing a good job.

, Each state requires a specific CNA instructor training course. You can contact your local nursing board, or ask at your place of employment, for details on the course you need to take. The course should prepare you to instruct future CNAs.The course is usually not long. You usually have to complete a set number of hours for training, after which point you will be certified as a CNA instructor.

, Once you're ready to apply for jobs as a CNA instructor, work on putting out a solid resume. A resume should highlight all relevant experience that makes you qualified to become a CNA. It should also include the certifications you've accrued over the years that make you legally able to teach.Choose a legible font for your resume, and keep formatting neat and consistent. If you're unsure where to start, you can look at sample resumes online.

Include any special skills you have, such as skills with a particular type of hospital technology.

, Once you have your resume together, you can begin the application process. Send your resume out to a variety of places looking for CNA instructors. You can find jobs on online job boards, especially job boards catered to medical positions. You can also call local hospitals and nursing schools and inquire about CNA instructor positions., Networking is one of the best means to find a job, so do not hesitate to take advantage of past contacts.

Show you are listening throughout the interview. Give non-verbal cues, such as smiling and nodding, to show you are paying attention. At the end of the interview, ask an open-ended question like, ""Why do you like working here?"" or ""What does an average day look like here?""

, Once you've gained a position, your career can begin. Work hard at being the best CNA instructor possible so you can have a long, fulfilling career.Care about your students. Be willing to explain concepts in easily understandable terms, and reach out to students who are struggling. Be willing to provide one-on-one support when necessary.
Take care to be well organized. CNA instructors have a lot of administrative duties, so make sure to keep track of any paperwork you receive.

Ask questions.",How to Be an Educated Man," Find a newspaper that you like, and read it daily. With the advent of the web, this is actually a very easy task. Reading your local news is not enough, so try to focus on news at the country and world level. You want to know as much about the wider world as possible. You can even try reading several different daily newspapers. You might want to read commentaries on the news as well.


You should read a variety of publications. Don’t limit to yourself to one country’s newspaper. Here are a few significant international publications:The India Times
Le Monde
The Asahi Shimbun
The New York Times
The Guardian
Washington Post

;
, Jot down notes about areas of the world that you are interested in. These notes can be a solid foundation for your later research. For example, let’s say that you have just read an article about ISIS. If you write down details about the countries ISIS occupies, such as Iraq and Libya, then you can find out more about how the current situation started.


Stay critical. Do not necessarily take everything you read at face value. Notice the biases and omissions of different newspapers instead of simply taking in talking points.

, Tune in to a news radio broadcast. The BBC and NPR are both good places to get solid world news. Since both are publicly funded, they may not be as biased as other news sources.News radio is also helpful because you will receive guidance on how to pronounce names of important regions and people.

, Magazines like Harper’s Magazine, The Atlantic, The Economist, Der Spiegel, and The New Yorker are good places to find out about what’s happening in the world. You can probably find copies at your local library, but you can also opt to subscribe to the magazines you enjoy. These magazines will give you details about the events you have read about in the newspaper. They often run long-form articles that focus on a specific region or topic.


These magazines have online versions as well. Peruse their archives and don’t simply focus on the news of the day. A piece on classical music from the 1930s might lead you to a composer you’ve never heard of before. The more of these articles you read, then the more you will broaden your general knowledge.
Writers in these magazines often write books as well. These books supply even more information about the topics that you have read about in magazines.

, Look at art pieces and engage with what you see. Try to take your time with several pieces. As you look at these art objects, try to comprehend what makes them special and individual. This should take time. Art appreciation is about contemplation.Engage with each art object with a different lens. A painting is different from a photograph and vice-versa. You should not look at a contemporary work in the same way that you would look at a classical one. Therefore, a contemporary oil painting deserves a different way of seeing than an oil painting from three hundred years ago. Remember that periods matter, as do movements.
Take a tour. The guide will tell you important details about significant pieces of artwork. Listen carefully, even if you have seen the piece before, you might find out a novel fact about the artwork or the artist.
See if they have take-away guides. These can also give you vital information about the museum’s collection.

, Immerse yourself in both contemporary and classic literature. Fiction can make you more empathetic by showing you the perspectives of other people.Start with classic literature. For example, Plutarch’s Lives is a compendium of stories about Greek and Roman men who lived interesting lives. Each story examines both the positive and negative qualities of these men.Observe the characters in these stories, and absorb the lessons in these tales.

, Philosophy will give you the tools to discuss questions about morality and free will. By reading philosophy books, you will be able to examine your own life and thought more clearly. This can aid in decision-making.


Read foundational works of philosophy. Start with Plato’s Republic. This fundamental work of philosophy consists of dialogues between Socrates and his students as they attempt to figure out what the perfect society would look like. As they design their hypothetical city, they discourse on free will, morality, and belief.

, When you read these books, make sure to keep a notepad handy so you can scribble down notes about the themes and ideas in these texts. You don’t want to get bogged down in every last detail. Writing down the most significant portion of what you’ve read is a great way to avoid becoming lost as you try to tackle these important works.

, Try to watch art-house films. There are many excellent films out there. Take the opportunity to watch a few of them. If it helps, try to pick one director and watch as much of their filmography as possible. Then, read criticism about films that you have seen. When you do this, you will be able to pick up on how that director decides to edit and shoot their films.


Read criticism. Read magazines like Sight and Sound and Cahiers du Cinema. Both have contemporary art-house film reviews and essays. They also publish articles about older, classic films by film scholars. The AV Club is also a great resource on films both old and new. Individual critics’ websites can be helpful as well.

, Of course, you probably listen to music. However, if you don’t already listen to a variety of different genres, you should try listening to a type of music that you haven’t listened to before. For example, if you mainly listen to rock music, you should try listening to classical. Or, if you only listen to classical, try listening to rock music. You want to have a diverse range of musical tastes. This shows that you are willing to explore.

, Get into conversations with people who have learned, whether through school or work, a great deal about life. Speak to them, and try to understand how they obtained that knowledge. Ask them questions about subjects that you don’t understand.


Talk to people from a variety of professions. Education takes its form in a variety of ways. An educated man realizes this. Your mechanic can as knowledgeable as your professor.

, Find out if a scholar or writer is giving a talk in your neighborhood. Go to the talk and listen to what they have to say. Often, after a talk, a question and answer session is held. Not only will you learn about a subject, but you will also be able to ask the lecturer questions directly.


Again, try to take accurate notes. This will make it easier for you to come up with good, stimulating questions that will allow for an invigorating discussion. Of course, don’t tire yourself writing down every word. Remember, you just want to mark down key concepts and ideas.

, During the course of your conversations, you will almost certainly end up disagreeing with the person you are conversing with. Try to understand their viewpoint. This does not mean that you need to agree with everything you hear. This would be foolish. However, an educated man does not dismiss someone based on a disagreement. Actually, arguments and debates show that you are willing to entertain ideas that are different from your own. They help you to develop your own point of view.


If you disagree with a perspective, you could say: ""I see why you would think this. However, I have a different take on the matter.""

, The mark of an educated man is a calm exterior.Don’t be quick to anger. For example, don’t start screaming because someone has angered you, simply react calmly and try to resolve the issue. You don’t necessarily need to disguise your emotions. You might be angry but don’t let that feeling affect the way you behave.


If you find yourself becoming angry, try to center yourself. Meditation is a good way to do this.

, Don’t raise your voice. You should still talk to people, but you do not want to be loudest person in the room, as this can make it seem like you are trying to call attention to yourself. However, you don’t want to be too quiet either. If you are very quiet, you may seem timid. An educated man will aim to strike a balance in his speech.

, An educated man is well-mannered and gentle. Try to avoid seeming arrogant or braggadocios. Contribute to the conversation by putting forth your point of view, but do this selectively. After all, you don’t need to show off your learning in every social situation.

, When you don't understand something, ask for an explanation. Don’t be afraid to do this. This shows that you are willing to learn. It is better to make a mistake while learning something new than to remain in ignorance due to a fear of embarrassing oneself.


An inquisitive mind is an intelligent one. If you did not understand a point, say: ""Would you mind explaining your last point again?""

Find a brave friend or family member to taste test your new creations.",How to Be a Great Cook," If all you've been doing is opening cans and ripping over packages of instant food, it's time to get daring and dip your fingers into food-from-scratch. Don't worry––there are plenty of recipes which explain exactly what to do in order to create real food that tastes great.;
, Go to the cookbook section and borrow some cookbooks that tickle your fancy. Try to stick with less complicated recipes to begin with though––you don't want to be put off before you've even started.


Basics cookbooks are very good books to begin with. These books tend to explain terminology and techniques, as well as providing samples of simple but essential recipes. You can learn a lot from even just one such book, and then graduate onto cookbooks that seem like favourites to you.
When reading a cookbook, check out how recipes are written and look for the basic terms and methods. Also notice that particular types of food (for example, bread, soup, meat, cake, etc.) have specific requirements in common to many recipes within that type of food.

, There are recipes everywhere on the internet, including on wikiHow. You have so many choices that it is important to work out which sites you like and trust instead of spending all day collecting recipes, so be discerning in your selection. It also helps to find recipes that allow comments; that way, you can see what others say about the recipes and what changes or additions they suggest.


Get to know the food bloggers. There are bound to be some you love because they cook the sort of food you like and share interesting anecdotes that make reading their blog worthwhile. You can usually subscribe to such blogs to get regular updates and when you're game, you can also share comments about your experiences of the recipes they're suggesting.

, Cooking shows are all over the TV nowadays, so it won't be hard to find one you like. This can help you learn techniques, find food of interest to you and maybe even get fired up about improving your cooking skills.


Warning: Cooking shows can be addictive. Try to keep them in perspective and ration the TV viewing.

, Learn what motivates and inspires other cooks. Observe them and ask questions. This can a fun and socially engaging way to learn more about cooking.

, Get started today. It doesn't matter if it doesn't work, you're learning and you'll learn faster by doing than by thinking about it. Expect to make mistakes and some stuff that doesn't taste so great. And for now, don't worry how it looks––work on how it tastes to begin with. Indeed, some people never get beyond how it tastes, and that is just fine because everyone loves good tasting food!


A word of advice: Don't try anything that requires expensive ingredients, has a very long list of steps, or is notoriously difficult at first. Give yourself a chance!

, That way, the errors aren't so costly and you can repeat until you get it right. And have fun in the process!

, That way, you won't get frustrated and you won't be stuck at a hot stove or cranky mixing bowl for more than a few minutes at a time.

, Taste the food you make, then practice how to make it taste better. A great cook can tell by mere taste what else needs to be added to improve a bland or strange tasting dish and most of this comes from sheer practice and innate decisions. On your side is the fact that you care enough about food to give this a go, so you'll get the hang of flavoring food in no time.


It really helps know what kinds of flavors you like and try to get them in your dish.

, There are basic techniques for repairing mistakes, such as thickening or thinning a food, lessening saltiness, and turning a failure into a completely different dish (with nobody the wiser). That said, some mistakes can't be fixed, such as burnt food (the taste goes all the way through). Learn when to simply throw out something and try again and when you can completely transform an error.

, In order to be a great cook, you need to be confident. Sometimes, being nervous can spoil your dish. Fake it until you make it (or bake it) and something good is bound to come out!


Some people truly believe that emotions get cooked into food. Hence, it would be advisable not to cook when you're angry, if you follow this belief.

, Ask this person to give you honest feedback and to make suggestions for changes. Be prepared to accept constructive feedback; you can't improve your skills without this.

Add 4 oz.,
Use anchovies to add the umami taste to a variety of dishes.,
Add soy sauce, fish sauce or seaweed flakes to Asian recipes to activate the umami taste.,
Create the umami taste from making miso soup.,
Add cured ham or bacon to any dish to activate the umami flavor.,
Add green peas to a dish to add a natural umami flavor.,
Add mature or dried mushrooms to a dish to produce the umami flavor.,
Buy umami paste to use in a combination of any number of casserole or pasta dishes.",How to Add Umami to Your Cooking," (113 g) of pungent cheese, like Parmesan, to the top of a pasta dish. There is approximately 0.42 oz. (12 g) of glutamate in 4 oz. (113 g) of Parmesan cheese. It will add a balanced savory flavor to bitter or sweet pasta dishes.;
, Salty, cured fish are rich in glutamate. For example, the classic Caesar salad places dried anchovies on top of the salad leaves, croutons and dressing to impart extra flavor.


You can also make or buy umami butter to place on top of beef steak, poultry or fish. It can be created by combining anchovy paste with butter.
You can enhance pasta sauces by adding anchovy paste to tomato paste when producing your homemade pasta sauce. The salt and oil inside the anchovy will boost the vegetable and fruit flavors in the sauce. This is also a great addition to pesto.
4 oz. (113 g) of tomatoes also contain 0.0007 oz. (0.02 g) of glutamate. This is most easily released by the addition of alcohol to the tomatoes. Traditionally, wine is added to a tomato sauce to release the umami flavor; however, it can be done more efficiently and effectively with the addition of vodka.

, These store-bought condiments are available in stores in either the condiment or Asian food section. They can be added during cooking or just after.

, Miso soup is made with dashi broth, created by heating water and adding edible kelp and shavings of fermented tuna. You can buy miso soup mix in stores, as the original ingredients are hard to find in western markets.

, The salt-curing process creates a savory flavor that pairs well with eggs, pastas, sandwiches and many other kinds of recipes

, Green peas contain a high amount of glutamate and they can be added as a side dish or in a casserole to create a natural, low-sodium savory flavor.

, One of the most common ways to do this is to add either white or black truffle oil on top of a dish or in the sauce.

, This paste is usually made from mushrooms, tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, balsamic vinegar and black olives. You can use it in the following ways:


You can use umami paste as a condiment. Spread a thin layer on crostini, burgers or sandwiches. You can also mix it into dips and mayonnaise.
Rub umami paste onto meat, poultry or fish, just as you would a salt rub. The taste will be incorporated into the meat through the roasting or cooking process.
Squeeze a half tsp. or tsp. (2.5 to 5 g) of umami paste into stir fries, casseroles, risotto, pizza sauce, pasta sauce, soup and stew.
Squeeze a small amount of umami paste into a heating pan. Add a small amount of white wine and stir well. This will create a sauce that can be added on top of vegetables or meats or used like a bouillon.

Pick what's in season.,
Check the prices on frozen and canned.,
Check out the weekly deals.,
Compare prices every time.,
Buy in bulk.,
Use coupons.,
Apply for SNAP or WIC.,
Find a farmer's market or local farms.",How to Afford Healthy Food1," When fruits and vegetables are in season, they tend to cost less. Often, grocery stores will run sales on what's in season because they know customers expect certain fruits and veggies at certain times of the year. As an added bonus, when things are in season, they taste better.In fall, look for produce like pumpkins, winter squash, cabbage, and apples.
In the winter, opt for winter squash, cabbage, and other root vegetables.
Springtime is great for produce like beets, leafy greens, spring onions, and asparagus.
Summer is a good time for watermelon, corn, and berries, just to name a few. You'll likely notice the cheapest produce prices in summer. Also, because produce is cheaper this time of year, you can buy extra and freeze it or can it yourself.;
, While you may prefer fresh fruits and vegetables, you can often save money by opting for frozen or canned instead. These options have the same health benefits, though be sure to pick ones that don't have added sugar or salt.Check your proteins, too. Frozen chicken may be cheaper than fresh, and canned salmon and tuna is likely cheaper than fresh fish., Most grocery stores run weekly specials, which you can learn about through their weekly ads. When something is on sale, that's the time to stock up on it. Most protein can be frozen and saved for later, for instance, so if your store is running a sale on boneless, skinless chicken breasts, buy some to use and save for later., You probably already know to check for the lowest prices on the items you're buying. However, you may get stuck in a rut buying a certain brand and assuming it's the cheapest, when prices change all the time. Check each time you buy.Look up and down, as grocery stores tend to put the most expensive items at eye level.
Keep an eye on store brands, as they tend to be cheaper.

, While buying in bulk can come with a higher price upfront, it'll be cheaper overall. For instance, buying a large can of quick oatmeal is much cheaper than buying a box of the instant packets. Add some fresh fruit to create your own flavors.You can also buy some items in bulk bins at health food stores. Often these stores will have items like grains, beans, pastas, nuts, granolas, flours, and sugars. You can get just what you need, taking advantage of the cheaper prices without having to buy more than you need.

, Take advantage of coupons when you come across them. However, only use them for the foods you already buy. If you're buying something you don't normally buy, you're just spending extra money that must come from somewhere else.

You can find coupons online, as well as in the newspaper. You can also use a variety of coupon apps to save money.

, If you are low-income, you might qualify for SNAP or WIC. SNAP is the contemporary version of food stamps, and you get your assistance on a debit-type card.WIC is only for women with low income who have young children. Pregnant women also qualify. It's also more restrictive about what you can buy, but it can still help you afford healthy food.Visit your local SNAP office to apply in person, or you can apply online in many states. Check if you can apply online in your state at https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/apply.
To apply for WIC, contact your local WIC office.

, Sometimes, you can find cheaper produce at farmer's market, though you must hunt for deals. Also, driving out to local farms to pick your own produce can make it cheaper, as well. Be ready to use what you buy, though, as farm-fresh produce doesn't tend to last as long as grocery market produce, which is bred and treated to last longer. However, you'll make up for it in flavor.

Some farmer's markets even accept SNAP.

Close and secure the box with cellophane tape on it, and it’s ready for transport.

",How to Pack Food Items Using Air Cushions1," Interleaving allows you to pack several items in 1 box. This is particularly useful for large items like beer and champagne bottles, therefore you should insert one air cushion into the base layer of the box.;
, You may find that organizing it in a particular way will help you fit more into it. Rather than stacking, insert a thin layer of items.

,, Whether it be food, furniture, jewelry, you may end up with void space, therefore you can fill it by layering.

, When small items are placed in a large box, there is usually void space. The air cushion is used as a filler to fill the gap. It is useful for item like cheese tins and packets.

Remove objects that can be broken or damaged during the evening.,
Check for allergies and dietary preferences beforehand.,
Do not overstock your bar.,
Politely decline to serve more alcoholic refreshments to anyone who seems to be drunk; avoid refilling their glass and remove bottles etc.,
Serve coffee and tea at the end of the evening.,
Make sure that there is a safe place for guests to leave their valuables.,
Be the ice melter.",How to Be a Responsible Host," It is better to keep things out of harm's way and avoid potential embarrassment and even injury to guests who might accidentally break something, as well as avoiding you the disappointment of a broken heirloom or expensive item!;
, If possible, ask people about dietary preferences and allergies prior to the event. If this is not possible, ask on their arrival.


Always have some basic back-ups tucked away somewhere for those who are with faith-based food restrictions, vegetarians, vegans, gluten-intolerant, dairy-free, egg-free, and for dieters. It sounds worse than it really is; for example, you can easily deal with all of these people with a single dish such as quinoa salad, roasted or steamed veggies, rice pasta main course, and a fruit salad for dessert is always an easy option!

, Aim for about 1 drink per person per hour. Offer self-serve wine and beer and only leave enough glasses for the amount of guests; more can be washed if asked. Leave plenty of non-alcoholic choices around as well, such as water, juice,and mocktails and sodas. Leave nibbles to distract drinkers from constant drinking. If you wish to have cocktails, serve one with pomp and ceremony at the beginning. You can also consider a single serve of liqueur at the end of the evening.

, from the service area at the end of the main meal. Call a taxi for anyone who looks unfit to drive and reassure them that there car will be safe parked at your home until the following day; offer to collect them even if this is not too difficult for you.

, This is a sign that any more drinking is at an end and it is a means by which to give your guests a chance to revive themselves and prepare to leave.

, If you have any concerns, have guests leave handbags etc. in an open area obvious to all.

, A responsible host fuels the conversation all night and steers like guests to like guests so that they feel comfortable with one another and find someone to converse with. Do notice the wallflower and try to draw them into the discussions. Ask questions and listen actively. Be ready to help others when you can. Finally, smile as much as you can!

Choose cheaper ingredients.,
Make your proteins last longer.,
Go vegetarian.,
Read labels.",How to Afford Healthy Food2," Not all healthy ingredients are expensive. In fact, many healthy ingredients are cheap. Take each category of food you need to buy, and figure out options in each one.

For instance, in whole grains, you can try oatmeal, brown rice, bulgur, popcorn, and whole-wheat bread and pasta.
For vegetables, pick ones like cabbage, leafy greens (like mustard greens, kale, or even broccoli), squash, carrots, and celery.
In fruit, go for cheaper options, such as oranges, apples, and bananas.
In the dairy section, reach for milk and plain yogurt in large containers., Keep in mind that you probably need less protein than you think in your diet. Making your proteins last across several meals will help both your budget and your diet. For instance, if you make a chicken one night, use the leftovers the next night to make a chicken soup. The night after that, use some of the chicken in tacos.Adult women under 30 only need 5 1/2 ounce-equivalents each day, while women over 30 only need 5 ounce-equivalents. Adult men under 30 need 6 1/2, while if you're 30 to 50, you need 6 ounce-equivalents and 5 1/2 if you're over 50.
An ""ounce-equivalent"" is one ounce (28 grams) of meat (3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards)., While you don't need to completely cut animal protein out of your diet, opting for plant-based protein sometimes can help cut costs. Try focusing meals around these vegetarian options, such as having beans and rice one night instead of chili.Some vegetarian equivalents to an ounce of meat include an egg, 1/4 cup (60 milliliters) of beans, peas, or lentils, 1/2 an ounce (14 grams) of nuts or seeds, a tablespoon (15 milliliters) of peanut butter, or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of hummus., While you need to compare prices on foods, you should also compare labels for items you're buying, particularly if you're buying prepacked food of any kind. For instance, if you must have a box of macaroni and cheese, it's best to pick the healthiest one you can find.Look for foods low in sugar and sodium. You should be eating about 2,300 milligrams (1 teaspoon) of salt per day. Also, check for lower trans and saturated fat. Even the healthier fats should only be 20 to 30 percent of what you eat.
Keep serving sizes to 400 calories or less. Also, check to see how many vitamins and minerals the food has.

Decide on your dinners for the week.,
Stick with what you know.,
Create your shopping list.,
Plan ahead when you eat out.",How to Afford Healthy Food3," Making a meal plan is essential to only buying what you need and staying under budget. If you don't already have healthy recipes you love, find some you like online or ask your friends for recommendations.One site you can try is the USDA's What's Cooking website (https://whatscooking.fns.usda.gov/). It has healthy recipes that you can use to plan meals.
Don't forget to plan around your schedule. Opt for leftovers or quick meals on nights you're going to be busy., You may think that eating healthy means you need to try out a bunch of new trendy health foods. While these trendy foods may be healthy, that doesn't mean they're the only healthy foods. Stick to simpler ingredients that you know, even something as simple as a roasted chicken with vegetables and brown rice. You'll be more likely to keep eating healthy, and you'll save money at the same time., Once you've planned out your meals, create a list of the items you'll need. Sticking to a list (and not buying extras) can help you stay on budget, so you can afford healthier food., Meal planning isn't just for eating at home. It can help to make a plan before you go to a restaurant. Look over the menu if it's available online, and compare calorie counts. Many restaurants have the calorie counts available, but you can also use online calorie counters or websites.Consider choosing a healthy appetizer to save money. It will also keep the portion small.
Opt for dishes with lean proteins paired with whole grains and lots of veggies.
Choose veggies or fruit over fries, onion rings, or mashed potatoes.
Ask for a take-out box when you get your food. Split it in half before you start eating, and put half in the box to take home. Splitting it up helps you control your portion and stretch your money.

Grow what you can.,
Create your own snacks.,
Boil up your own stocks and broths.,
Branch out into making other foods.",How to Afford Healthy Food4," Often, having a small garden or even a few potted plants can be a cheap way to get in the veggies you need. Try growing a tomato plant, for instance, or even just a few herbs on your window sill., You can buy pre-made snacks at the store that are a bit healthier than your average chips, such as veggie chips or fruit cups. However, they tend to be expensive, so making your own at home is a more affordable alternative.For example, try making kale chips. Wash and dry kale thoroughly. Chop or tear the leaves into large pieces. Toss them in olive oil, or spray them with cooking spray, and then spread them out on a large baking sheet in a single layer. Sprinkle salt and pepper on top and any other seasoning you want. Bake them at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 Celsius) until crispy (about 15 minutes).
You can also make yourself individual cups of fruits and veggies. For instance, cut up oranges, apples, and grapefruit, and toss them with a tiny bit of honey. Spoon them into small reusable containers so you can grab them any time. You can do the same with veggies. Cut them into bite-sized pieces, and put them in reusable bags. Spoon out (homemade) hummus into individual containers to go with them.

, Stocks and broths are a great way to start out soups, but buying them in cans or cartons can get expensive. Plus, they're often loaded with extra sodium. Making your own at home results in better quality, and it's cheaper, too.You can even make a stock with your scraps. Save the bits of vegetables you have leftover, such as onion skins, the ends of carrots, and the tops of celery. When you eat a chicken, save the bones and the bits of meat. Freeze them in a bag until you have enough. When you do, throw them in a pot and cover them with water. Boil them (covered on low heat) for six to eight hours or until you have a stock with a flavor you like. Strain it, and your stock is ready.
Once you have your stock, you can portion it out in small containers and freeze it.

, Lots of foods besides snacks and broths can be made cheaper at home. For instance, if you eat yogurt often, making your own yogurt might be a good option. For bread, consider investing in a bread machine, so you can make your own bread with the push of a button."

Look around for subscription services.,
Consider kitchen scissors.,
Give a gift certificate to a local food store.,
Give plants.,
Consider giving him/her cultural cookware.,
Buy them a cookbook.,
Take close up pictures of dishes they have made.",How to Give a Gift to Someone Who Likes to Cook," Help out, if you have the chance. Notice if any tools or utensils seem flimsy, worn, or if any task seems to require undue time or effort.


Find out if the recipient is trying anything new. Is he learning how to bake bread? This might be the right time for a dough scraper.
There is a gadget for almost everything. The right tool will be a great help in their cooking. The wrong tool will be just so much unused clutter.
Remember that a worn tool may be worn because it's well used and the right tool for the job. If it's on its last legs, a replacement may be just the thing. If it's an old standby and still going strong, don't replace it.
Keep your ears open for any opinions (good or bad) about the tools they have or don't have. These are often good clues as to what gifts would be well received.;
, If you also cook, there's a good chance you know a dish or two that would be new to your recipient.


Offer to cook it with the person, if you have time. This is especially valuable if the recipe involves any special techniques. Create a small gift voucher or promise note setting out the offer.

Write out the recipe and put at least the non-perishable ingredients together as a mix or kit. One possibility is to put them in a jar.

, The best ingredients may not be something entirely new, but something a little fancier or more expensive than the ones they currently use. Here are some possibilities to get you started:


Salt and pepper. For a gift, look for the fancy, gourmet versions, such as pink Himalayan salt, that your aspiring chef may not have tried yet. Many come in grinders.






Real maple syrup. You could pair it with a pancake or waffle mix, or with a griddle or waffle iron if they don't yet have one.

Honey. Honeys can be as diverse and complex in flavor as wine, depending on what kinds of plants the bees visited. See what your local natural foods or specialty store offers, and get a special kind, or a selection.






Handmade pasta. Include some quality olive oil to round out the gift.
Balsamic vinegar. If you live near a wine region, your local winery should have some excellent choices.

, Homemade bread, jam or preserves, or fresh, homegrown produce all make excellent gifts.


Include a label with relevant dates and ingredients. You might also like to share the recipe, unless it's a family secret!

, A foodie outing can be a wonderful experience as a gift and you get to enjoy the experience too.


Go wine tasting.






Give the cook a day off. Visit a good restaurant together, or cook for the person.

Visit a farmer's market or gourmet market together. Offer to purchase some items there as part of the outing.
Look for local restaurant events in which you get to sample restaurant cuisine portions at great prices; this can make a fun and inspiring outing.

, In many places, it's possible to subscribe to an assortment of things, either on a one-time or monthly basis.


A wine of the month.
A Community Supported Agriculture program (CSA). Here, you support with a local, small farm, buying fresh, local produce (and sometimes eggs and meats).
A cooking-related magazine.

, Good kitchen scissors are indispensable, yet scissors get damaged and lost, and kitchen scissors are often chosen as an afterthought.


Quality knives are also desirable but not everyone is comfortable with giving knives as a present.

, Natural and specialty foods are good choices, if your recipient will use them.


Another useful idea is to give a certificate to cooking classes at a local store or restaurant. Be sure to check for flexibility in the classes so that your recipient can attend at their convenience.

, Even if it's just a windowsill, start an indoor herb garden or supply the seeds, pots, and soil for one.


An indoor salad-growing kit is a wonderful gift for apartment dwellers and winter gifts.

, A wok, chopsticks, and sushi rollers can be a great gift as well.

, Maybe they could make some exotic recipes they've never heard of using that, or even making a classic recipe that's really popular among a lot of people.

, A macro lens or camera set on close-up or food mode works great. Compile the images into a photo book and add in notes or simply blank lined pages for the recipient to write in their recipe for the dish."

Divide the room evenly.,
Decorate together.,
Take turns picking out the items you’ll both be using.,
Set ground rules.,
Keep your areas clean.,
Keep noise levels down.,
Always ask before borrowing their things.,
Stay calm and respectful.,
Discuss problems in a timely matter.,
Spend time apart.,
Seek another person to remediate conflicts.",How to Share a Room," Set boundaries in the space for areas that are yours and your roommate’s. This can mean simply dividing the room in half down the middle, or creating various nooks and sections throughout the room. To create privacy, buy a folding screen or hang curtains to cordon off separate spaces., Go shopping together for things like bedding, curtains, rugs, and wall art. This is a good way to bond and get to know your roommate’s style preferences.If you don’t wish to buy new stuff (or can’t afford to), you can still do other decorating activities together like painting, hanging posters, or organizing your closet.

, You likely won’t agree on every single thing you need for your room. Create a sense of fairness by splitting the design decisions for common items. For example, let your roommate choose the style of the rug, then you choose the curtains., Have a conversation right away about your lifestyle and pet peeves. Decide what time the lights, music, or TV will be turned off at night. Discuss how often you’ll allow guests, how clean you’ll keep your space, and whether you can borrow each other’s belongings.


Create a written roommate agreement that you both sign. That way if someone breaks the rules, you can bring out this contract to help resolve any disputes., Pick up after yourself as often as possible so that your roommate doesn't have to deal with your mess. Place your dirty clothes in a laundry basket or hamper so that they’re not strewn across the floor, and hang towels immediately after using them. If you agreed you would both make your beds every day, do that as soon as you get up in the morning.Trade off doing tasks like vacuuming and dusting. Posting a cleaning schedule on the wall can help you keep track of whose turn it is.

, Be aware of the noise you create when you talk on the phone, watch TV, listen to music, or have a snack, since these sounds can quickly become irritating to someone else. If your roommate is attempting to study or sleep, use headphones with your electronics. And try to find another space outside the room to talk on the phone for long conversations.


Schedule quiet hours, such as 10:00 pm to 8:00 am, so you know exactly what time you need to switch the sound off.

, Unless it’s a common item, like a TV you both share, don’t just start using their belongings without asking first. If they’re not around, send them a quick text to ask permission. If the answer is no, do not attempt to borrow it without them knowing. You don't want to give your roommate any cause to distrust you.If you want to encourage a relationship where you borrow each other’s things, offer yours first. Tell them they can borrow a jacket or use your printer whenever they need it.

, Don’t lose your temper and lash out at your roommate if they do something you don’t like. This will create resentment and likely won’t solve the problem at hand.Take deep breaths and kindly ask them to not do whatever is bothering you. Your roommate might not even be aware that their behavior is irritating.


For example, don’t snap “Be quiet!” at them. Say, “The music is making it hard for me to study. Could we have one hour of quiet time?”

, Don’t allow your frustrations to build over time without bringing them up. The first time after something happens, address the issue within 24-48 hours. This will ensure all the details are fresh in both of your minds and will keep your anger from simmering too long.If there’s a recurring issue, schedule a time to sit down and discuss it. Setting a specific time to have a meeting can show that you’re serious about communication.

, Don’t spend all your time, both in and out of the room, in each other’s company. Everyone needs some alone time, so don’t be afraid to ask for it. Just make it clear that it’s not because the other person has done anything wrong.Try offering a “me-time” trade. You get the room to yourself for an hour, then go somewhere else so your roommate can have an hour alone in the room.

, If you can’t resolve an issue between the two of you, find a third, unbiased person to listen to both sides. If you’re siblings sharing a room, ask a parent to do this. If you’re college roommates, most universities have designated resident assistants who are trained in this sort of conflict resolution."

The plants will eventually be hung from ceiling hooks using twine. Kokedama are traditionally made up of a variety of different plants, so invest in variety when building a kokedama. Stop by a greenhouse and pick up some potted plants to build your kokedama. You can also take in plants from outdoors if you garden., Whether you're using potted plants or outdoor plants for your kokedama, the first step is to remove the plants by their roots. Remove the plant from the pot or ground. Gently use your fingers to remove the soil from around the roots. For plants with very fine roots, rinse them in the sink to remove the soil.When bringing a plant in from outdoors, always check the leaves for bugs and other pests before bringing it inside.

, Take a plastic grocery bag and bucket. Put on some gloves. Use peat moss and bonsai soil for your kokedama. Using a 7:3 ratio of moss to soil, mix your moss and soil together until you have an even mixture.You need enough moss and soil to cover every plant's roots in a ball of soil and moss. The precise amounts will vary depending on how big of a garden you're making.

, Remove a chunk of soil and moss from the bucket or plastic bag. Use your hands to roll it into a thick, firm ball. Make a ball big enough to completely cover a plant's roots. When you're done, set the ball aside., Use sphagnum moss, which you can buy online or at a greenhouse. Wrap the moss around the plant's roots several times until the roots are covered completely. Then, wrap some twine around the plant's roots to secure them.The amount of moss you need will vary depending on how big your ball is.

, Break your ball in half. Sandwich your plant's roots around the ball of moss and soil. Then, pat the ball together again so it's firmly secured around the roots., Wrap a layer of sheet moss around your ball. You can buy sheet moss at a greenhouse or online. Get a full layer of sheet moss surrounding the ball.The amount of moss you need varies depending on the size of your ball.

, Wrap twine around the ball as needed to secure the sheet moss. Tightly circle the twine around the ball until everything holds together. You should be able to lift and move your ball without soil or moss spilling., Take another piece of twine. Use a piece as big as you want considering where you're going to hang your kokedama. Tie both ends of the twine around the twine securing the plant. You should now have a plant on a string you can hang up., Choose a spot in your home to hang your kokedama. Place your plants directly in front of a north facing window if possible. If you don't have a north facing window, hang the plants two to three feet from a south, west, or east facing window., Each day, lightly mist your plants with tap water in a spray bottle. You can also place a tray of pebbles and water underneath the plants to add necessary humidity., You water kokedama plants by soaking them in a bowl of room temperature water for 10 minutes. Drain the soil ball in a colander until it stops dripping and then rehang the plants.Kokedama plants should be watered when they start to feel light and the leaves turn brown.

, Watch your plants closely. When you notice any dead or brown leaves, use a pair of scissors or plant sheers to remove them.Brown leaves that appear regularly are a sign you're not watering your plants often enough.

, As the plants grow, the roots will begin poking through the moss and soil balls. At this point, you need to repot them with new balls. For most plants, this is necessary about once or twice a year."

Use soap and water to remove stains.,
Create a solution with oxygen bleach powder to remove mildew.",How to Clean the Outside of a House1," If possible, wait to clean the outside of your home on a warm, dry day. A windy day will cause overspray, which will come back on you as you clean. If it isn’t possible to clean on a warm day, at least wait for a dry to clean the outside of your house., Begin by making sure all doors and windows are closed. Secure them with tape if necessary. Put duct tape and plastic sheeting over outside light fixtures, vents, and electrical outlets. Move lawn furniture away from the home. Cover plants and shrubbery with plastic sheeting.Make sure kids and dogs are inside while you clean if you’re using a pressure washer.

, Inspect your home before you begin cleaning. Look for stains that can be cleaned without the use of a garden hose or pressure washing. For most stains, you can use a scrub brush, water, and regular dishwashing soap. Scrub the stain until it begins to lift., For tougher stains, like mildew, use a solution made out of oxygen bleach, water, and dishwashing liquid. Put a gallon (3.8 L) of water, one-quarter pound (1 L) of oxygen bleach, and a one-eighth cup (29.6 mL) of dishwashing liquid in a bucket. Dip a scrub brush in the bucket and scrub the mildew until it lifts.Be very careful when handling bleach. Make sure to wear eye protection, rubber gloves, and handle it in a well-ventilated area.

Leave a gift.",How to Make Yourself at Home," When someone suggests that it's okay to ""make yourself at home"", accept that they really mean it and take them at face value. It's actually not very polite to expect the host to wait on you hand and foot and to keep providing you with permission once they've made it clear to treat their place as your own. That can become trying on the host very quickly. So, be at ease with the fact that they trust you this much and are happy for you to help yourself.;
, As well as being accepting, let yourself relax into the situation. Close your eyes. Imagine that you have no worries, no fears, nothing! This can help loosen yourself up.

, This can be easy, as most topics to talk about can be of a recent activities such as a vacation, a personal accomplishment or a job promotion. Remember, your topics are limitless, you just have to start with one and the conversation will flow. By maintaining a conversation you will be able to focus more on the conversation and less on the uncomfortable feeling.

, Take a little look around you. Find the things you like, not dislike. Start up a conversation about what you like. Ask where he/she, bought, found, or received a particular object from.

, Ask about what happened. Ask if everybody had fun.

, If the host has clarified that you can help yourself to certain things, ask for the location and for any special rules, tricks or quirks that you need to be aware of. For example, if your host is happy for you to make your own meals, get your own breakfast and eat snacks, ask where the food and utensils are, what's expected by way of replenishing used foods and if there is anything you need to be aware of when cleaning up, such as special washing methods for fragile items, keeping cupboard doors child-locked, etc.


Don't be afraid to ask again whenever needed. It's better to know than to go ahead and break or ruin something in the house.

, Put food containers back where you found them. Make use of cleaning items to clean up after yourself. For example, use the toilet brush to keep the toilet clean, squeegee the shower after washing and lift bathmats off the floor to dry. Keep doors and windows as you found them, or ask whether it's okay to position them differently.


Ask about water and power restrictions. Don't be greedy about usage; find out in advance.
Ask before making calls using their landline or downloading/streaming content using their broadband. If there are additional costs involved, offer to reimburse them.

, Think about the fact that if you did this at home, you'd have to restore or renew the items/services, and as such, it's a cost to your host. Your host may not wish this but it is polite to offer sincerely.

, Avoid wandering around the house naked, but if your host is happy with PJs till noon, that's fine for you too. If your host eats dinner in front of TV, then you can too but if they prefer the table, then do so along with them. And so on.


If your hosts take their shoes off at the door, do so too.

, Ask if their companion animals have specific quirks, needs or fears and how you can be careful and considerate around them. Offer to help feed the pets if that's something you'd like to do.

, Don't be in their way, don't interfere with their daily plans and make it clear that you don't expect them to be hosting you 24/7. Their comfort level is a priority too.

, After your stay, leave a decent gift with your host, to say thank you for their kindness.

Cut the posts.,
Nail the sideboards to the posts.,
Dig out the grass.,
Place landscaping fabric at the bottom of the bed.,
Place a layer of compost.,
Top the compost with soil.,
Make a grid with strings.,
Plant the seeds.",How to Make a Sandbox Garden," Use a circular saw to cut two to three 4x4’s into four posts. The posts should be twice as long as the height of your bed. Plant the posts halfway into the ground. Use a measuring tape to space out the posts according to the dimensions of your bed.You can have your posts (and sideboards) pre-cut at your local hardware store. Just make sure you know what size you want your garden to be before going to the hardware store.
For example, if you want your garden to be seven inches (178 mm) high, then have four posts pre-cut to fourteen inches (355.6 mm) long.;
, Have four sideboards pre-cut to fit the frame of the bed. The sideboards should be at least six inches (152 mm) high. Use a hammer to nail the sideboards to the outsides of the posts to make your frame. The posts should be inside the frame.For example, if you want your garden to be a 5x5 foot (1.5x1.5 meter) square, then have four sideboards pre-cut to five feet (1.5 meters) long.
Make sure the nails you use are long enough to attach the sideboards to the posts.
If you do not have time to build your own raised bed, then use an existing sandbox as your frame.

, Use a spade to remove the top layer of grass inside of the frame. Removing the grass will allow your plants’ roots to grow deeply into the ground., Cut a piece of fabric that is an inch smaller than the size of your garden frame. Lay the fabric on top of the freshly dug ground. Use your hands and feet to smooth and press the fabric into the ground.For example, if you have a 5x5 foot (1.5x1.5 meter) frame, then cut a 4'10x4'10 foot (1.47x1.47 meters) piece of fabric to fit inside the frame.

, Use a shovel to place the compost on top of the landscaping fabric. Fill your bed a third of the way with the compost and rake the compost smooth., Fill the rest of the bed with nutrient rich soil. Shovel the soil on top of the compost until the bed is full. Then rake the soil until it is smooth., Staple or tape strings lengthwise and across your garden to create a grid. Space the strings five to seven inches apart. The grid will help you plant the seeds evenly and uniformly., In each square, dig a small hole or furrow with a stick or spade per the instructions on the seed packet. Place one or two seeds inside each furrow and cover it with soil. Use a gardening pail to water each seed.Only use enough water to dampen the soil around the seed.

Use a cleaning kit or brush to clean the outside of your hose.,
Work from the bottom to the top.,
Rinse with water if a cleaner was used.",How to Clean the Outside of a House2," You can buy a siding cleaning kit with a nozzle attachment from your local home improvement store. Or, you can buy an automobile brush that will attach to your hose. You can use only water to clean if your house isn’t heavily soiled. If it is, you will need to use a cleanser. A siding kit should come with a compartment to pour the cleanser into the attachment.You can find cleanser specifically made for washing the outside of houses at most home improvement stores.

, Spray your hose at a downward angle. Work from the bottom to the top of the house. Work in small, separate sections at a time., If you used more than water, you will need to rinse off the cleanser. Again, work from top to bottom as you rinse off the house with only water. You do not need to do anything to dry off the house."

Choose a nozzle to pressure wash with.,
Test the pressure washer on a small section of your house.,
Spray downward.,
Move the pressure washer from side-to-side.,
Move from top to bottom if using a cleanser.",How to Clean the Outside of a House3," Nozzles are typically measured in degrees. The spray is stronger the lower you go in degrees. Choose a low setting if you aren’t familiar with pressure washing. A 40-degree angle is good to start with. You can gradually work down to a 25-degree angle if the 40-degree nozzle isn’t getting the job done., Pressure washing can do damage to a house, especially if the material the house is made of is weak or has weakened. Spray the pressure washer on a small, hidden part of the house. Switch to a garden hose or call in a professional if you see any damage done by the pressure washer., Begin pressure washing by spraying at a downward angle. Spraying at an upward angle can cause water to get trapped in the cracks or seams, which can cause damage to your house later on., Hold the pressure washer steadily as you pressure wash. Move the pressure washer from side-to-side in a sweeping motion. You should still be holding the pressure washer at a downward angle. Continue until you have cleaned all of the outside of the house.Do not stop at one spot when using the pressure washer—always continue moving. Stopping in one place can cause damage.

, Water alone should typically be enough to pressure wash the house, but you will need to wash in a different motion if you’re using a cleaner. Spray from top to bottom if you’re using a cleaner. Rinse off the cleanser with water when you are finished pressure washing."

Remove rust from items.,
Restore old china.,
Get stains out of clothing.",How to Use Borax Around the House2," Pour borax powder into a small container and add drops of lemon juice, stirring until a paste is formed. Using a spatula or sponge, apply the paste to rusty objects around the house (e.g. pots and pans) and let it sit for half an hour. Use a scrub brush to scour the rusted area in circular motions, then rinse the item completely to remove the paste. Repeat if necessary., Fill your kitchen sink 3/4 of the way and add 1/2 cup (96 g) of borax powder. Gently place your old china in the sink and let it soak for half an hour. Drain the sink, rinse the borax off of the dishes, and rewash them with regular dish soap., Mix 1/4 cup (48 g) of borax powder to a half a gallon (8 cups) of warm water. Pre-soak clothing or linens stained with oil, grease, or protein-based stains (e.g. blood) in the borax mixture. Let the stained items sit for 30 minutes before washing them normally with laundry detergent."

Kill household insects with borax.,
Remove fleas from carpets.,
Keep mice at bay.",How to Use Borax Around the House3," Borax powder contains boron, a substance that is poisonous to self-grooming insects like ants, silverfish, beetles, and cockroaches. Sprinkle borax powder in areas of your home that insects frequent (e.g. the floor of a storage cupboard), making sure that no pets or children have access to it. Alternatively, make an insect bait by mixing borax with a sweet and sticky substance like honey or corn syrup., Sprinkle borax powder on areas of your carpet that are ridden with fleas. Use a stiff broom or carpet brush to brush the powder deeper into the carpet to reach any fleas that are hiding in it. Let the powder sit for six hours, then vacuum it out.Keep small children and pets away from the area as it may cause skin irritation, or breathing problems in cats.
Note that borax can kill fleas and larvae but will not destroy the eggs.

, To keep mice from certain areas of your house, sprinkle borax powder in a thin line along the bottom of the wall. Mice tend to move along the bottom of walls and will likely avoid areas where they have come into contact with borax, which sticks to their feet. Be sure to avoid sprinkling it on areas of the floor that you may step on."

Evaluate the materials used.,
Check out some architecture books.,
Pay attention to design details and hardware used.,
Scrape through layers of paint.,
Talk to your neighbors.,
Track down previous owners.,
Use a metal detector in your yard.",How to Research the History of Your House1," Over the years, many different types of materials and styles of craftsmanship are used to build houses. The types of materials used can give you some ideas about when the house was built and how long it has been since any changes were made.For example, one place you can look is under the water tank lid of the toilet. If there is a toilet in your house that is original to the house, the date stamp on the water tank lid will give you a good idea of when the house was built. If the toilet isn't original, that date will at least give you an idea when the bathroom was last remodeled.
If your house has a mansard roof, for example, it was likely built in the late 19th century. However, keep in mind that certain styles and housing designs were still being built in more provincial areas long after they had fallen out of favor in urban centers, so the location of your house will be important in identifying the era in which it was built.
Look closely both inside and outside your house, and try to identify building materials used. Bring in an expert if you're unsure what type of wood or stone was used.;
, Go to your local library or research online to find out the design style of your house and when that style was popular in your area. This can give you some clues as to when the house was built.Keep in mind that old houses often have been updated several times to reflect changing trends or the desires of the owners. Your house may incorporate several different architectural styles.
Your house also may have been built at different times. For example, the original house may have been built in one style, and then the owners built an addition in a different style 40 years later.
Even with many decades of additions and renovations, you typically can uncover a core style to your house. This gives you a general idea of the era in which the house was built.

, Cabinetry and design styles go in and out of fashion through the years, and these details not only tell you something about the history of your house, but also give it a unique character.The types of nails and molding used can provide some important clues as to when your house was built.
You can review design books or look online to find other instances of original molding or cabinetry to help date your house. Even if these elements aren't original, dating them can provide clues as to when that particular room was remodeled.

, The walls of an older house may have 10 or more layers of paint. If you don't want to cause too much damage to your house, find an inconspicuous spot and scrape through the layers.A professional can help you analyze the age of the lower layers of paint. The colors used also can provide clues, since different interior colors go in and out of fashion through the years.
The composition of the paint also can be analyzed to link it to a particular era, since paint has been made using different chemical compounds over the years.

, Anyone who's been living in your neighborhood for a long time can help you understand more about the history of your house. Neighbors can be particularly helpful if you're new to the neighborhood.Ask them if they knew the people who lived in the house before you, and whether they can remember any renovations being done.
If they are amenable, you also can talk to them about the history of their house or ask to inspect its details. Since your neighbors' house may have been built around the same time as yours, this can offer you some important clues.

, You typically can uncover the names of previous owners by looking through the deed history of your house. In the United States, this information is typically available at the county recorder or register of deeds.Once you have a name, you can track them down on the internet for free, or through a commercial people-locator service.
Keep in mind that some people may not want to be contacted, and may not want to talk to you. The house may hold painful memories for them, or they may just not want to be bothered. Respect their wishes and avoid infringing on their privacy.
The best way to contact a previous owner typically is by sending a letter. Explain who you are and why you want to contact them. Provide them a means to contact you back if they're willing to talk.

, A metal detector can be a great way to uncover old coins and other artifacts that may add their own unique story to your house and help you learn more about the house's history and its previous owners.


Take care digging up artifacts in your yard. You may want to contact an archaeologist or local historian if you believe you've found something of possible historic significance.

Check the date.,
Feel the bill.,
Look for the security thread.,
Check microprinting.,
Look for color-shifting ink.,
Find the watermark portrait.,
Pay attention to blurry borders.,
Use a counterfeit money detection pen.,
Compare it with another bill.",How to Check if a 100 Dollar Bill Is Real1," The newest $100 bills are “Series 2009” bills, and they have many different security features. Older bills are being phased out of circulation to prevent counterfeiters from fooling people.Nevertheless, older bills are still legal tender, so if you get one you shouldn’t automatically assume it is fake. Check the date on the bill.


The average $100 bill stay in circulation for seven years. Accordingly, most of the older bills should be out of circulation by now. Nevertheless, you might have one or more stored at home that you want to check.;
, U.S. currency has a distinctive feel. The bills are printed on cotton and linen, not paper. Also, bills should have slightly raised ink, which is a feature of the printing process.If you handle currency as part of your job, you should quickly develop familiarity with the feel of authentic money.


Using touch is not foolproof, however. The most successful counterfeiters will bleach real money and then print over it.
Nevertheless, counterfeiters struggle to reproduce the raised printing, so feeling the bill is a good first step.

, A $100 bill printed after 1990 should have a security thread on the left-hand side that is only visible when you hold the bill up to the light. The words “USA” and “100” should alternate on the thread. If you hold the bill up to UV light, then the thread glows pink., Older bills used microprinting as a security feature. Use a magnifying glass to check for microprinting, which will appear in different spots depending on the year the bill was issued.


For example, in $100 bills issued between 1990-1996, the words “The United States of America” should appear on the outer edge of the portrait oval.For bills issued between 1996-2013, “USA100” should appear in the numeral 100 on the lower left-hand corner. You should also see “The United States of America” in the left lapel of Franklin’s coat., $100 bills issued between 1996-2013 employ color-shifting ink. Tilt the note in the light and look in the lower right-hand corner. The numeral 100 should change from green to black., Bills printed after 1996 have a watermark portrait of Benjamin Franklin in the blank space at the right-hand side. The image should be very faint but visible from either side., Real bills should have clear, sharp lines, which are very hard for counterfeiters to reproduce. If you see blurry printing or text, then you are probably dealing with a counterfeit., This pen is sold at Amazon and costs $5. It checks for common chemicals used in counterfeits. However, fraudsters have gotten wise and no longer use the chemicals, so the pen isn’t foolproof.Nevertheless, you can now buy a counterfeit detection pen that has a UV light built into the cap and costs under $10.

, No special security features were used on $100 bills printed before 1990. Accordingly, the best way to check its authenticity is to compare it to another $100.You might have to go to a bank to check if the bill is authentic.


You can also visit the U.S. Currency website and find images of older $100 bills.

Lean the ladder against the gutters near a nail.,
Scoop out leaves and debris that are stuck in the gutters.,
Move the ladder to the next section and continue cleaning.,
Flush the gutters with a garden hose.,
Check the water flow through the downspouts.",How to Clean Aluminum Gutters1," Locate a place on the gutters where a nail holds them to the house. It is best to place the ladder here because the gutter is supported best at the nails. If you place the ladder farther from a nail, the gutter is weaker and may crush.If you can lean the ladder against the house’s main structure rather than the gutters, do this to entirely avoid leaning on the gutters.;
, Use a small garden trowel to scoop out as much of the debris as possible. If you don’t have a small trowel, find an empty plastic bottle with a sturdy handle. Cut the bottom and part of the side out to form a scoop.Set up a large garbage can or a tarp on the ground for a place to dump the leaves as you clean.
Throw the leaves on the compost pile if you have one, or discard them in the garbage.
Lean to your right and left, scooping as much as you can without moving the ladder. Be careful not to lean so far that you get off balance. Ladder safety is always important.

, Since you can probably only reach a few feet to either side of the ladder, you’ll need to move it multiple times until you have removed all of the buildup from inside the gutters.


This is the most time-consuming part of the cleaning process.

, Carry the nozzle of the hose with you up the ladder to the gutters. Use a sprayer attachment, if you have one, to increase the water pressure. Spray the gutters toward each of the downspouts to rinse remaining debris out of the gutters.It may take a while to wash all of the gunk out of the gutters, but it will be worth it to make sure future rain can flow freely through them.

, While the water is running, check each downspout to see if the rinse water is washing down through them. If there seems to be a blockage, use a stick, such as a broom handle, to push the blockage from the top to the bottom of the downspout.


Leave the water running while you push to help move the blockage along. You may need a longer stick, depending on where along the downspout the blockage is.

If your bank isn't part of the network that includes the foreign bank you're using, the fees for using the ATM can make this a less desirable option for exchanging currency.;
, Purchases made with a credit card overseas are no different than they are at home. The credit card company will charge a nominal currency exchange fee. This is another good option for currency exchange if fees are a concern.

, Typically, only very large banks in high tourist locations have foreign currency on hand, and only the most common currencies. However, if you give your bank a few days' notice, it will order the currency you need for a small fee.

,


Traveler's checks can be purchased at your local bank, which will charge a fee. Keep your proof of purchase and check numbers in case you lose them.
One advantage of traveler's checks over cash is that they will be replaced it lost or stolen, making them a good option in places where theft is a problem. However, you may have difficulty finding merchants that will accept them.

, Currency exchange desks at airports carry the highest surcharge for exchange than any other. If exchange fees are not an issue, then the convenience of the exchange counter may appeal to you.

, Larger hotels usually have a currency exchange desk for their patrons. Exchange rate fees are typically only slightly better than airport exchange fees.

, The foreign currency is shipped to the desired location. Converting money this way can be expensive because of the delivery fees.

, Larger banks at your destination will convert your currency to traveler's checks. They will charge higher fees for this service than your local bank.

If your car loan, for example, is a 6% loan, you pay 6% interest each year. Compounding once at the end of the year is the easiest calculation for compounding interest.A debt may compound interest annually, monthly or even daily. 

The more frequently your debt compounds, the faster you will accumulate interest.

You can look at compound interest from the investor or the debtor’s point of view. Frequent compounding means that the investor’s interest earnings will increase at a faster rate. It also means that the debtor will owe more interest while the debt is outstanding.

For example, a savings account may be compounded annually, while a pay-day loan can be compounded monthly or even weekly. 
;
, Assume that you own a $1,000, 6% savings bond issued by the US Treasury. Treasury savings bonds pay out interest each year based on their interest rate and current value.Interest paid in year 1 would be $60 ($1,000 multiplied by 6% = $60).

To calculate interest for year 2, you need to add the original principal amount to all interest earned to date. In this case, the principal for year 2 would be ($1,000 + $60 = $1,060). The value of the bond is now $1,060 and the interest payment will be calculated from this value. 


, To see the bigger impact of compound interest, compute interest for later years. As you move from year to year, the principal amount continues to grow.Multiply the year 2 principal amount by the bond’s interest rate. ($1,060 X 6% = $63.60). The interest earned is higher by $3.60 ($63.60 - $60.00). That’s because the principal amount increased from $1,000 to $1,060.

For year 3, the principal amount is ($1,060 + $63.60 = $1,123.60). The interest earned in year 3 is $67.42. That amount is added to the principal balance for the year 4 calculation.

The longer a debt is outstanding, the bigger the impact of compounding interest. Outstanding means that the debt is still owed by the debtor.

Without compounding, the year 2 interest would simply be ($1,000 X 6% = $60). In fact, every year’s interest earned would be $60 if you did earn compound interest. This is known as simple interest. 


, It can be handy to visualize compound interest by creating a simple model in excel that shows the growth of your investment. Start by opening a document and labeling the top cell in columns A, B, and C ""Year,"" ""Value,"" and ""Interest Earned,"" respectively.

Enter the years (0-5) in cells A2 to A7. 

Enter your principal in cell B2. For example, imagine you are started with $1,000. Input 1000. 

In cell B3, type ""=B2*1.06"" and press enter. This means that your interest is being compounded annually at 6% (0.06). Click on the lower right corner of cell B3 and drag the formula down to cell B7. The numbers will fill in appropriately. 

Place a 0 in cell C2. In cell C3, type ""=B3-B$2"" and press enter. This should give you the difference between the values in cell B3 and B2, which represents the interest earned. Click on the lower right corner of cell C3 and drag the formula down to cell C7. The values will fill themselves in. 

Continue this process to replicate the process for as many years as you want to track. You can also easily change values for principal and interest rate by altering the formulas used and cell contents. 


, The compound interest formula solves for the future value of the investment after set number of years. The formula itself is as follows: FV=P(1+ic)n∗c{\displaystyle FV=P(1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}} The variables within the equation are defined as follows:

""FV"" is the future value. This is the result of the calculation.

""P"" is your principal.

""i"" represents the annual interest rate.

""c"" represents the compounding frequency (how many times the interest compounds each year).

""n"" represents the number of years being measured. 


, If interest compounds more often than annually, it is difficult to calculate the formula manually. You can use a compound interest formula for any calculation. To use the formula, you need to gather the following information:Identify the principal of the investment. This is the original amount of your investment. This could be how much you deposited into the account or the original cost of the bond. For example, imagine your principal in an investment account is $5,000.

Locate the interest rate for the debt. The interest rate should be an annual amount, stated as a percentage of the principal. For example, a 3.45% interest rate on the $5,000 principal value.

In the calculation, the interest rate will have to be input as decimal. Convert it by dividing the interest rate by 100. In this example, this would be 3.45%/100 = 0.0345. 



You also need to know how often the debt compounds. Typically, interest compounds annually, monthly or daily. For example, imagine that it compounds monthly. This means your compounding frequency (""c"") would be input as 12.

Determine the length of time you want to measure. This could be a goal year for growth, like 5 or 10 years, or this maturity of a bond. The maturity date of a bond is the date that the principal amount of the debt is to be repaid. For the example, we use 2 years, so input 2. 


, Input your variables in the right places. Check again to make sure that you are inputting them correctly. Specifically, make sure that your interest rate is in decimal form and that you have used the right number for ""c"" (compounding frequency).

The example investment would be input as follows: FV=$5000(1+0.034512)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}}

Compute the exponent portion and the portion of the formula in parenthesis separately. This is a math concept called order of operations. You can learn more about the concept using this link: Apply the Order of Operations.


, Simplify the problem by solving for the parts of the equation in parenthesis first, beginning with the fraction.Divide the fraction within parentheses first. The result should be: FV=$5000(1+0.00288)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1+0.00288)^{2*12}}

Add the numbers within parentheses. The result should be: FV=$5000(1.00288)2∗12{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.00288)^{2*12}}

Solve the multiplication within the exponent (the last part above the closing parenthesis). The result should look like this: FV=$5000(1.00288)24{\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.00288)^{24}}

Raise the number within the parentheses to the power of the exponent. This can be done on a calculator by entering the value in parentheses (1.00288 in the example) first, pressing the xy{\displaystyle x^{y}} button, then entering the exponent (24 in this case) and pressing enter. The result in the example is FV=$5000(1.0715){\displaystyle FV=\$5000(1.0715)}

Finally, multiply the principal by the number in parentheses. The result in the example is $5,000*1.0715, or $5,357.50. This is the value of the account at the end of the two years. 


, This will give you the amount of interest earned.

Subtract the principal of $5,000 from the future value of $5357.50 to get $5,375.50-$5,000, or $357.50

You will earn $357.50 in interest over the two years. 


, Compounding interest accounts can increase even faster if you make regular contributions to them, such as adding a monthly amount to a savings account. The formula is longer than that used to calculate compound interest without regular payments, but follows the same principles. The formula is as follows: FV=P(1+ic)n∗c+R((1+ic)n∗c−1)ic{\displaystyle FV=P(1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}+{\frac {R((1+{\frac {i}{c}})^{n*c}-1)}{\frac {i}{c}}}}The variables within the equation are also the same as the previous equation, with one addition:

""P"" is the principal.

""i"" is the annual interest rate. 

""c"" is the compounding frequency and represents how many times the interest is compounded each year.

""n"" is the number of years. 

""R"" is the amount of the monthly contribution.


, To compute the future value of this type of account, you will need the principal (or present value) of the account, the annual interest rate, the compounding frequency, the number of years being measured, and the amount of your monthly contribution. This information should be in your investment agreement.

Be sure to convert the annual interest rate into a decimal. Do this by dividing the rate by 100. For example, using the above 3.45% interest rate, we would divide 3.45 by 100 to get 0.0345. 

For compounding frequency, simply use the number of times per year that the interest compounds. This means annually is 1, monthly is 12, and daily is 365 (don't worry about leap years). 


, Continuing with the example from above, imagine that you decide to also contribute $100 per month to your account. This account, with a principal value of $5,000, compounds monthly and earns 3.45% annual interest. We will measure the growth of the account over two years.

The completed formula using this information is as follows: FV=$5,000(1+0.034512)2∗12+$100((1+0.034512)2∗12−1)0.034512{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1+{\frac {0.0345}{12}})^{2*12}-1)}{\frac {0.0345}{12}}}}


, Again, remember to use the proper order of operations to do so. This means that you start by calculating the values inside of parentheses.

Solve for the fractions with parentheses first. This means dividing ""i"" by ""c"" in three places, all for the same result of 0.00288. The equation now looks like this: FV=$5,000(1+0.00288)2∗12+$100((1+0.00288)2∗12−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1+0.00288)^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1+0.00288)^{2*12}-1)}{0.00288}}}

Solve the addition within the parentheses. This means adding the 1 to the result from the last part. This gives: FV=$5,000(1.00288)2∗12+$100((1.00288)2∗12−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.00288)^{2*12}+{\frac {\$100((1.00288)^{2*12}-1)}{0.00288}}}

Solve the multiplication within the exponents. This means multiplying the two numbers that are smaller and above the closing parentheses. In the example, this is 2*12 for a result of 24. This gives: FV=$5,000(1.00288)24+$100((1.00288)24−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.00288)^{24}+{\frac {\$100((1.00288)^{24}-1)}{0.00288}}}

Solve the exponents. This means raising the amount within parentheses to the result of the last step. On a calculator, this is done by entering the value in parentheses (1.00288 in the example), pressing the xy{\displaystyle x^{y}} key, and then entering the exponent value (which is 24 here). This gives: FV=$5,000(1.0715)+$100(1.0715−1)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.0715)+{\frac {\$100(1.0715-1)}{0.00288}}}

Subtract. Subtract the one from the result of the last step in the right part of the equation (here 1.0715 minus 1). This gives: FV=$5,000(1.0715)+$100(0.0715)0.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,000(1.0715)+{\frac {\$100(0.0715)}{0.00288}}}

Multiply. This means multiplying the principal by the number is the first set of parentheses and the monthly contribution by the same number in parentheses. This gives: FV=$5,357.50+$7.150.00288{\displaystyle FV=\$5,357.50+{\frac {\$7.15}{0.00288}}}

Divide the fraction. This gives FV=$5,357.50+$2,482.64{\displaystyle FV=\$5,357.50+\$2,482.64}

Add. Finally, add the two number to get the future value of the account. This gives $5,357.50 + $2,482.64, or $7,840.14. This is the value of the account after the two years. 


, To find the interest earned, you have to subtract the amount of money you put into the account. This means adding the principal, $5,000, to the total value of contributions made, which is 24 contributions (2 years* 12 months/year) times the $100 you put in each month for a total of $2,400. The total is $5,000 plus $2,400, or $7,400. Subtracting $7,400 from the future value of $7,840.14, you get the amount of interest earned, which is $440.14.
, To really see the benefit of compound interest, imagine that you continue adding money monthly to the same account for twenty years instead of two. In this case, your future value would be about $45,000, even though you will have only contributed $29,000, meaning that you will have earned $16,000 in interest.

Visit your local courthouse or county recorder.,
Find a copy of your property's abstract.,
Go to your local municipal planning agency.,
Check city directories and atlases.,
Review survey maps and field books.",How to Research the History of Your House2," At the courthouse, you typically can learn the official lot number or description of the property where your house is located. You may not find correct information using your street address, since these can change over time.Your local or county tax assessor also may have this information within the tax records for your property.
Keep in mind that official record keeping of land and properties typically uses a different system than street addresses with which you're familiar. This system allows you to track the history of your house from the moment it was built.
If you live in a place that has been continually inhabited for hundreds of years, even the property grid/lot system itself may have changed over time. In this case, you may also need to make a trip to your local historical society.

, The abstract records all deeds or other legal transactions associated with your property. These documents typically are located at the county courthouse, although you may have been given a copy when you purchased the home.Review the history of the purchase and selling price. A dramatic increase in the selling price over a short period of time may mean a building or room was added, or that the house was substantially renovated. You can cross-reference with any building permits for additional clues.
If you live in the United States, visit your local or county courthouse to look at the deed registry, usually found in the clerk and recorder’s office. This information is indexed by a lot and block number in a city, and a section, township and range for rural property.

, The government office that issues building permits should have public records pertaining to your house. The building permit can contain a treasure trove of information including the house's original dimensions, construction dates and costs, and the names of the people originally involved in its construction.Keep in mind that you typically must pay a small fee to acquire these documents, including a search fee as well as a fee for your own copy.
If your house is hundreds of years old, you may need to visit the local historical society to find the building permit.

, If you live in a larger city or town, directories and atlases can help you uncover details about your house throughout the past. In many areas, these city directories and maps were in use hundreds of years ago.Directories and atlases also can help you identify changes in street names and other geographical details that you can use to target your research and find more information about your house.
These directories and atlases typically are available at the municipal planner's office. If they are not there, staff typically will be able to point you in the right direction.

, Survey maps and property field books are common sources of information about the history of a property. These typically are located in either local or national archives, and were maintained for tax purposes.Talk to someone at the property tax assessor's office to find out where historical records are kept and how you can access them. Keep in mind you'll typically need to pay a fee to have them retrieved.

Read local newspaper archives.,
Visit your local historical society.,
Search for information online.,
Compile a chronological history of your house.",How to Research the History of Your House3," Your local library typically keeps archives of the local newspaper. If there's more than one branch, the central or main branch usually holds the largest collection.If you live in a rural area with no library nearby, try at the largest city or urban area, or maybe the county seat. That library typically will have archives pertinent to your area.
Search backwards, looking for mentions of construction in your neighborhood or the names of the house's previous owners.
Keep in mind that street names and numbers can change over time, so record any changes you see and the dates so you can construct a chronology.

, Most regions have a historical society that maintains historical records and information about your house and your general neighborhood. Larger cities often have their own historical societies, but if you live in a rural area you may have to seek out the historical society that covers a larger regional area.If you have an extremely old house, such as those commonly found in Europe, neighborhood information may be all you can find to research the history of your house.
If your house is less than 200 years old, the historical society may have a wealth of information, particularly if any of the house's previous owners were well-known in the community or the house was the site of a significant event in local history.
Take care handling delicate old documents, and follow the historical society's rules regarding the care and copying of these documents.

, There are many websites dedicated to preserving genealogical records and property history records, often available for free. You can use these resources to find information about your house as well as its previous owners.For example, if your house is in the United States, you might search for records at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) website. The NARA maintains all official government genealogical and land records, and also has links to other databases with a wealth of information.
If your house is in Ireland or the United Kingdom, you might start your online research at the Building History website, located at buildinghistory.org. This site is maintained by a historian and provides a wealth of resources for researching the history of your house, including deeds, wills, tax documents, and maps, as well as images and information about towns and villages.

, As you uncover information about your house, order it chronologically so that you can map the house's history from original construction to the present. Keeping your information ordered this way also enables you to identify gaps in that history where more research is needed."

If the bill is series 2009, then the serial number should begin with J.
If the bill is series 2009A, then the serial number should begin with L., The new $100 uses raised printing on Ben Franklin’s shoulder. Run your fingers over the spot. You should be able to feel texture., There is a large copper-colored inkwell to the left of the bill’s serial number. Inside the inkwell is a bell, which should change color from copper to green as you look at the bill from different angles.The numeral 100 beside the inkwell should also change color, just as it does on some older $100 bills.

, An embedded thread runs just to the left of Franklin’s portrait. The letters “USA” and the number 100 alternate along the strip, which is visible from both sides of the note.


If you hold the bill up to UV light, then the strip should glow pink.You can also purchase a counterfeit detector which shines UV light, which might be helpful if your business handles a lot of bills. A popular option is the AccuBanker D63 Compact. It costs about $50., Just to the right of Franklin’s portrait is a blue security ribbon. This ribbon is 3-D. Move the bill back and forth and check that you see the number 100 and tiny bells move from side-to-side as you move the bill.This ribbon is woven into the paper, not pasted on. Accordingly, if the blue ribbon is peeling off the bill, then you have a fake.

, Hold the bill to the light and look for a faint image of Benjamin Franklin in the white oval on the right-hand side. You can see the watermark portrait on either side of the bill., Check around Franklin’s jacket collar. You should see the words “The United States of America” in small type.You should also see “USA 100” around the white space that contains the portrait.The words “100 USA” should also appear around the quill pen to the right of Franklin.

Rinse the gutters with a hose.,
Place your ladder at a sturdy point along the gutter.,
Spray a gutter cleaner on a small section of the outside of the gutters.,
Let the liquid sit for about ten seconds.,
Scrub the gutters with a non-metal, rough-bristled brush.,
Wipe the cleaner off with a wet cloth.,
Move the ladder and clean one section at a time.,
Give the gutters a final rinse when they are all cleaned.",How to Clean Aluminum Gutters2," Use a sprayer attachment, if you have one, and spray the gutters from the ground to rinse them. Spray a five to ten foot section at a time, because otherwise the gutters may dry before you have cleaned them.Another option is to spray the gutters down entirely at the beginning so that you can turn the hose off. If you do this, you may want to re-wet the gutters with a damp rag before you spray them with cleaner.

, Gutters are held to the house with long nails, so the sturdiest place to lean the ladder is near one of these nails. Farther from the nails, the gutters are weaker and may crush with too much pressure.Leaning the ladder against the house’s main structure, rather than gutters, is always a good option when it is available.

, Buy gutter cleaner at a home improvement store or a big-box store. General purpose cleaning products, like Simple Green, work well. Also look for gutter cleaners like Gutter Brite, Streak Getter, or Krud Kutter. Hold the bottle a few inches from the gutter and spray liberally.Do not use cleaners with ammonia, paint remover, or anything with abrasive particles because these can weaken and damage the gutters.

, Rather than wiping the cleaner off immediately, let it sit for a little bit so it has time to work. If the liquid begins to run off, wipe it up faster, but the cleaner cuts through buildup better if you let it sit for a few seconds.

, Grab a common household scrubbing brush and scrub the gutters to loosen any stains or buildup. It’s important not to use a metal-bristled brush because it can scratch the gutters or remove protective coatings.Bad stains may require you to scrub for a minute or more, but mild stains will come off quickly after the cleaner has loosened them.

, After you scrub the gutters, grab a bucket filled with hot water. Use an old rag to wipe the cleaner off of the gutters. If anything remains stuck on the gutters, rub at it with the rag. If you can’t get hot water outside easily, use water from the garden hose.

, Repeat the process of rinsing with water, spraying a cleaning solution, scrubbing with a brush, and wiping with a rag until you have cleaned all of the gutters. This entire process can take a few hours or more depending on the size of your house and the severity of the stains on the gutters.

, If you are able to get a hose to reach all sides of the house, stand on the ground and spray water up at the gutters. Rinse any remaining cleaner or residue off of the gutters until they appear clean.

The defined period of time is typically more than one year. It can either be calculated with a mathematical formula or found using spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel. You can also find CAGR calculators on the internet., The mean is the mathematical average of two or more numbers.The formula for CAGR calculates the average annual growth of an investment.

 For example, suppose you invested $10,000 in stocks in 2012, and the value grew to 14,000 in 2013, to $15,000 in 2014, and to $19,500 in 2015.  

 The formula for the CAGR would calculate the average amount by which the stock’s value grew each year.

 The CAGR represents how much an investment would have grown each year as if it had grown at a steady rate. However, investments don’t grow at a steady rate. Rather, they experience peaks and valleys. The CAGR averages all of these changes in value., The growth rate is the amount by which an investment increased in value over a specific period of time. In this case, it refers to how much an investment has grown in a year. Calculations of historical growth rate are often used for estimating future growth.The CAGR does not measure what happened in one year. Rather, it refers to the average annual change in an investment over a period of several years.  


, The term compound refers to the way that compounded interest investments grow exponentially. Investments generate earnings. These earnings are then reinvested and generate earnings of their own. As this process continues over time, investments can continue to grow, even if you don’t add any money to them.In other words, compound interest differs from simple interest in that interest is earned both on the original investment and interest earned, rather than simply on the original investment. 


,  In order to calculate the CAGR, first you need to define the period of time for which you want to do the calculation.  Next, you need to know the beginning value of an investment.  Then, find out the ending value of the investment for the time period.,  Divide the ending value by the beginning value.  Then raise the result to the power of 1 divided by the number of years in the time period.  Finally, subtract 1 from the result.Raising a value to an exponent is done on a calculator by entering the first value, pressing the exponent button (usually represented as xy{\displaystyle x^{y}}), then entering the exponent value and pressing enter. Alternately, you can type the expression into Google using the ""^"" symbol between the base number and exponent. The search engine will solve it for you. 


, In the example above, the period was three years, from 2012 to 2015.  The beginning value was $10,000.  The ending value was $19,500.

 Use the following formula: CAGR=((endingvalue/beginningvalue)1numberofyears)−1{\displaystyle CAGR=((endingvalue/beginningvalue)^{\frac {1}{numberofyears}})-1}

 Using the above formula, CAGR=(($19,500/$10,000)13)−1{\displaystyle CAGR=((\$19,500/\$10,000)^{\frac {1}{3}})-1} 

This equals (1.950.333)−1{\displaystyle (1.95^{0.333})-1} 

This then equals 1.2493−1{\displaystyle 1.2493-1} 

Which solves to 0.2493, or 24.93 percent.




, Create rows and columns in the spreadsheet to display the year and the investment's value that year. Once you have the data entered, create a row where you will enter the formula for the CAGR. Once you enter the formula, Excel will perform the calculations for you.Using the above example, in cell A1, you would enter the word “YEAR.” Then, in cell B1, you would enter the year 2012. Then you would enter the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 in cells C1, D1 and E1.

 In cell A2, you would enter the word “VALUE.” Then in cells B2, C2, D2 and E2, you would enter $10,000, $14,000, $15,000 and $19,500.

 In cell A3, you would enter the letter “n,” where n equals the year count.  In cell C3, under the information for 2013, you would enter the number 1. Then enter the number 2 in cell D3 and the number 3 in cell E3.


, In cell E4, enter the formula ((E2/B2)^(1/E3))-1. Cell E2 is the ending value, $19,500.  Cell B2 is the beginning value, $10,000. Cell E3 is the number of years in the time period, 3. The calculated CAGR for the time period is 24.93 percent., Instead of entering the formula used above, you can use the POWER function to calculate the CAGR. It will result in the same answer, but some Excel users prefer to use functions instead of entering manual formulas.In cell E4, enter the formula POWER(E2/B2,1/E3)-1. The POWER function returns the result of the ending value divided by the beginning value, raised to the power of 1 divided by the number of years. The answer is the same, 24.93 percent.


, The RATE function returns the interest rate over the time period in question. This function looks a bit complicated. But once you understand the elements, then you can quickly create this function on the spreadsheet. Some people like this method because it expresses the result as a percentage instead of as a decimal.The first element in the function is nper, which is the number of years, which is in cell E3.

 The next element of the function is pmt. This would be the payment made each period on a loan or annuity, but we don’t need that to calculate the CAGR. Just leave that space blank.

 The next element is the pv, which stands for present value. But it refers to the beginning value of the investment, which is in cell B2.

 The last element is fv, which is the future value. This refers to the ending value of the investment, which is in cell E2. 

 In cell E4, enter the formula RATE(E3, ,-B2,E2). You need to enter the beginning value, cell B2, as a negative number.  Otherwise you will get a #NUM! error.

 Using this formula, you will get the same answer, 24.93 percent.   


, Suppose you have money in a savings account with a fixed annual interest rate and you also stock in a portfolio with a varying return. Use the CAGR to compare the growth rate of the portfolio investment over time with the growth rate of the savings account.  This can help you to decide which investment is has the higher rate of return over time.For example, suppose you put $5,000 in the savings account for three years, and it had a 1 percent fixed annual interest rate.  At the end of the third year, you would have $5,151.50.

 Suppose the market was very volatile over the same time period, and you had a $3,000 portfolio investment. The value varied widely over the three years, but at the end of that time period, the investment would be worth $3,200.

 If you calculate the CAGR on the portfolio with the formula -1, you get a CAGR of 2.17 percent.  

 Compare the CAGR of the portfolio to the savings account. Even though the market was so volatile, a CAGR of 2.17 percent is a better return than the 1 percent growth offered by the savings account.


, Looking at the CAGR of different metrics over time might provide a clearer picture of a company’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, suppose the CAGR of a company’s market share was 1.82 percent over a five-year period.  But suppose in the same time period, their customer satisfaction CAGR was -0.58 percent. This discrepancy highlights areas in which the company could improve., The CAGR artificially smooths the rate of growth of an investment. Don’t assume that the rate of growth was really that steady. Remember that the market can be volatile. Check the values that go into the CAGR each year to understand how the market fluctuated during the time period in question., No matter how steady the CAGR appears, even if you have checked the annual values, never assume that steady historical growth implies steady future growth. Market volatility and other factors may affect the future growth of the investment. Use other metrics along with the CAGR to evaluate the expected rate of growth of your investments.,  Depending on the time period you analyze, you can get very different results for the CAGR.  Once you calculate the CAGR for a specific time period, look further back in time to see if changing the time period significantly alters your result. You may find a much more modest CAGR over a longer period of time.For example, suppose over the course of five years, a $100,000 investment lost money in the first two years, but then grew significantly in the last three years.  The CAGR for the last three years would be high, because the investment grew.  But if you look at it over a five-year period, you include the reductions in value, and the CAGR would be more modest.

 For example, suppose the $100,000 decreased to $67,000 in year one and to $43,000 in year two.  Then in year three it started to recover and grew to $75,000, then to $92,000 in year for and to $125,000 in year 5.

 If you calculate the CAGR for the last three years, you would use the formula -1 = 42.72 percent.

 However, if you calculate the CAGR for the entire five years, you would use the formula – 1 = 4.27 percent.  This is far more modest.

Identify the values needed to calculate CAGR.,
Input these values in the CAGR formula.,
Solve for CAGR.",How to Calculate Cumulative Growth1," In order to calculate CAGR, you will need a few essential values. This includes the starting value, ending or finishing value, and the period of time over which you wish to measure growth.


Determine the starting value (SV) of an asset, for example, the price paid for a share of stock.
Determine the ending value (EV) or current market value of that asset.
Determine the period of time (T) you want to study, for example, the number of years, months, quarters, etc.;
, After you've gotten your information together, input your variables into the CAGR equation. The equation is as follows: CAGR=((EV/SV)^ 1/T)) -1., After your values have been inputted in the CAGR equation, simply solve for CAGR using the proper order of operations. That is, be sure to calculate the (1/T) first, because it is an exponent, then solve for EV/SV and raise that number to the power found in the first step. Finally, subtract 1 from the number you just found. The result will be your CAGR.


For example, if a portfolio of investments had an initial value of $10,000 that grew to $19,500 over 3 years, you would start with CAGR=(($19,500/$10,000)^(1/3))-1 and simplify to CAGR=((1.95)^(0.333))-1 and CAGR=1.249-1. Your final result would be CAGR=0.249, or 24.9%.

"
Calculate CAGR using an online calculator.,
Calculate CAGR using Microsoft Excel.",How to Calculate Cumulative Growth2," Perhaps the simplest way to calculate CAGR is to use an online CAGR calculator. These programs allow you to simply input your values for SV, EV, and T and will do the rest of the work for you. In order to find one of these calculators, try searching on a search engine for ""CAGR calculator."", Another simple way to calculate CAGR is to used Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet programs will likely perform this function just as well, but may require different formula structures. See help guides for these programs to learn how to perform these functions. In any case, start by inputting your values (SV, EV, and T) into cells in a new spreadsheet. For example, put SV into A1, EV into B1, and T into C1.


The easiest way to calculate CAGR in Excel is to simply enter the CAGR formula into a fourth cell. This requires entering the following into D1 (or any other cell you see fit): =((B1/A1)^(1/C1))-1. Excel will complete the calculations for you and the result will be presented in whichever cell you choose for the equation.An alternate method of calculating CAGR in excel uses the POWER function, which calculates equations using exponents. For this calculation, create a cell for the formula and enter: =POWER(B1/A1,(1/C1))-1. Again, the answer should appear in this cell after you press enter.Additionally, Excel can calculate CAGR by using the RATE function. Input this formula into a new cell by entering the following: =RATE(C1,-A1,B1). Press enter and Excel will display the answer."
"
Identify the values needed to calculate CAGR.,
Calculate future value using CAGR.,
Analyze your result.",How to Calculate Cumulative Growth3," CAGR can also be used to predict future growth based upon a historical CAGR.This is done similarly to calculating a historical CAGR. In order to calculate future value, you will need a few essential values. This includes the starting value, ending or finishing value, and the period of time over which you wish to measure growth.


Determine the starting value (SV) of an asset, for example, the price paid for a share of stock or the current revenues of a company.
Determine the period of time (T) you want to study, for example, the number of years, months, quarters, etc.Enter the CAGR percentage as a decimal. For example, the CAGR percentage of 24.9% calculated in method one would be entered here at 0.249.

, Future values can be calculated using the following formula: FV = SV(1 + CAGR)^T. Simply input the values you have decided on and calculate the future value in a similar way to calculating CAGR. You can either calculate this value by calculator or using a computer.


To calculate this on a computer, use a spreadsheet program and enter the program into an empty cell. For example, a potential calculation in Excel would start with SV in cell A1, CAGR in cell D1, and T in cell C1. To calculate FV, enter the following into an empty cell: =A1(1+D1)^C1 and press enter., When using your CAGR to predict future values, keep in mind that no historical data can accurately predict the future. However, using a CAGR can serve as a somewhat reliable estimate of future growth.Keep in mind also that this CAGR represents an average of the growth of the represented values and will likely be lower or higher within the given year or period of time that you are trying to estimate.

Never add water to grease!

",How to Prevent Kitchen Grease Fires,";
, Some oils can be heated more than others before catching fire. If you are cooking and the oil starts to smoke it's not only nearing the flash point, meaning it's close to catching fire, but it will emit unfavorable flavor and ruin the taste of food.

, Even gas stoves continue to transfer heat when the flame is extinguished.

, Food can fall quickly into the grease and make it splash out, causing grease burns to you or hitting the heat source and catching fire.

,, For example if you are cooking chicken and the grease and chicken are three inches deep, the pan sides should be at least six inches deep.

Have a disaster kit with the basic supplies in your home.,
Right after the storm, avoid driving if at all possible.,
Explore your property and avoid any unsafe conditions.,
If there was some flooding, use the small gas powered water pump to clear your house.,
Now that you know you are safe at home, get ready to hold up there until power comes back and water service is restored and safe to drink.",How to Survive After a Storm," It's a good idea to keep one in your car and another at your place of work. The basic disaster supply kit should hold you for 3 days, but to survive the long haul, you will need much more.


A good kit would have the following: 5000 watt generator which will run for 13.4 hours on 6.5 gallons (24.6 L) of gas. Four 5 gallon (18.9 L) gas cans for the generator. Four 100 foot (30.5 m) extension cords. Small 25cc gas powered mini-water pump. (to remove any flood water from house or yard) several cases of canned goods. (soup, stew, beans, etc) powdered milk and eggs. Fifty 1 gallon (3.8 L) jugs of drinking water. (1 gallon per day per person) a week supply of clean dry clothes sealed in plastic bags placed into large plastic totes. charcoal, lighter fluid, and waterproof camping matches. (enough to grill 7-10 times) A 2 burner Coleman propane camp stove and extra bottles of propane. Light choices, pick more than one. Coleman battery powered lantern, propane powered, and camp fuel powered. Extra batteries for everything. Energizer battery powered cell phone charger. Military MREs (meals ready to eat, bought at army surplus store,,,civilian level bought at academy sporting goods) Chain saw. Plastic painters drop cloths. Large plastic tarps. Elastic straps and nylon rope to tie down/secure things. NOAA weather radio. First aid kit. Sanitation and hygiene items and BABY WIPES. Large Igloo maxcold cooler packed with ice (should keep ice for 7-10 days) 20 extra gallons of gas for your vehicle. Extra supply of Deet insect repellent. A large camping tent, sleeping bags and an air bed w/pump. Camera, cash, loose change, medication, pet food, something to read and some board games.;
, With flooded streets, downed power lines, and no traffic signals, it's just not safe.

, Look for downed power lines, trees, or unstable building conditions. If it's something as simple as tree branches on your house or vehicle, use the chainsaw to cut up and remove the branches, and then the tarps to patch the damage.

, Remember that mold may soon follow so you may have to go to the tent.

, You must keep that generator away from your home when it's running. Carbon monoxide poisoning kills, and even if it's outside, but near an open window, it's deadly. Because you have a few hundred feet of extension cord, get that generator nice and far away. With the double male ended cord you can plug into the generator and then into any outlet in the house. This will power every circuit connected to that wall plug. You can also keep power to your fridge, but you do not have to have it going 24/7... it will keep everything cold enough if you only leave it running for an hour every few hours. Now we have meat! Although you have the ability to use an electric range/stove, why not get out there and grill some of that meat. you have the choice of charcoal, propane, or electric.

Search for damage on the metal.,
Set up a ladder to your roof to examine the top of the roof.,
Identify the types of damage caused by hail.",How to Spot Hail Damage," Check metal roof vents, flashing or metal valleys on the roof to see if there are any dents. Soft metal will show dents, and also indicate the size of the hail.;
,


Check the ridge cap of the roof for dents. This area of the roof will receive the most damage from hail since it is flat and will take a direct hit in a storm.
Look at the shingles. Check the whole shingle, as well as the edges, for signs of damage.

, The 3 major signs of hail damage include bruising, cracking and granules missing from asphalt.


Check for missing pieces in the asphalt of the roof. Look for areas on the shingle that have exposed, black substrate. This means the granules of the asphalt have been compromised or knocked off by something.
Search for bruising in the shingles. Dents from hail are not always completely visible. Run your hand over the shingle to feel for small dimples in the surface. Press 1 of the dimples to see if it has any give. If it does, this is a sign that the shingle has begun some deterioration.
Look for cracking in the shingle. Large hail can make a circular crack if the hail hits it hard enough.

Look outside for a flash of lightning.,
Once you see the lightning, begin counting right away.,
Stop counting once you hear a roll of thunder.,
Divide the number of seconds you counted between the lightning and thunder by five.,

Once you have found your quotient, that is how many miles or kilometers away lightning is.",How to Track Lightning," They can happen very quickly and suddenly, so be very attentive. If the bright light hurts your eyes, look through a translucent curtain to dull the impact of the light, or focus your eyes away from the window so the lightning flashes in your peripheral vision.


Note that faraway lightning will be much more difficult to spot, so keep a steady watch. If you sense the storm is not close to you (e.g. faint thunder) watch more carefully for lightning bolts.;
, Start a stopwatch, count in your head, or use the stopwatch on your phone. Do not stop.

, Listen carefully- distant thunder may be difficult to hear. If you have been counting for a very long time, chances are you missed the thunder. Search for another bolt of lightning and start the process over.

, (For example: 10 divided by 5.) If the dividend cannot be wholly divided by five, you can either round the quotient or divide to a decimal (you may need a calculator).


Before proceeding, make sure you didn't accidentally make a minor mistake or miscalculation.
If you want to find out the distance of lightning in kilometers, divide by three. (e.g. 9 divided by 3). You are likely to come across a decimal, so choose if you want an exact measurement or a rough estimate.

, (For example, 10 divided by 5 equals 2, so lightning is two miles away, or 9 divided by 3 equals 3, so lightning is 3 kilometers away.) You can do this as many times as you like, but try to space your countings a minute or two apart, otherwise you will likely end up with roughly the same result.

With time, the miles away of the lightning should either get smaller or larger, depending on whether the storm is moving closer or farther away from you. If you get roughly the same number for a extensive period, check your work to make sure you didn't have any miscalculations.

Leave the blanket in place for at least 15 minutes.,
Call the fire department.",How to Use a Fire Blanket1," Fire blankets are generally stored in small bags with two white tabs hanging down. Pulling on the tabs will quickly release the blanket, allowing for quick access in the event of an emergency., You do not want any flame or smoke to hurt your hands. Roll the corners of the blanket over your hands to protect them. You can also use flame retardant gloves if you can get them on time to deal with the situation promptly., Once you have the blanket secured over your hands, place it over the flames. Do not throw it, but lay it down gently. Start with the nearside of the flames and move in. Throwing the bottom of the blanket on the far side first can cause flames to creep up over the blanket, worsening the situation., If the flame was started by any heat source, such as an oven, stove burner, or space heater, turn the heat source off. This will decrease the amount of time it takes for the fire to suffocate.


Expect some smoke to run through the blanket. This is normal. It is not a sign the blanket itself is on fire or not working properly., Leave the blanket at the heat source until flame is suffocated. This should take about 15 minutes. Do not attempt to move or touch the blanket until it's cool again., Call the fire department. If you can't get the fire out yourself, you need emergency assistance. Even if you do get the fire out, you need to contact the fire department to make sure the flame is fully extinguished and there's no chance lingering embers or heat could cause another fire."

It's best to store fire blankets in the kitchen, as this is where most home fires break out.
The sooner you can get to, and use, a fire blanket, the better the chances are of containing the fire., Fire blankets are not designed to be reused. It can be dangerous to use a fire blanket again if it's already been used to fight a fire. Wait until a fire blanket is room temperature to the touch before disposing it. Just to be safe, it might not be a bad idea to douse the fire blanket in water before disposal., You should never be without a fire blanket or extinguisher in the event of an emergency.

Follow the rescuers' instructions carefully.",How to Survive an Abduction or Hostage Situation," If you can escape the initial abduction attempt, your ordeal ends right there. However, the first few minutes of a hostage-taking situation or an abduction are the most dangerous, and they become more dangerous if you resist. While in many cases, the potential for immediate escape outweighs the danger of resistance, there are times (if there are multiple armed attackers, for example) where escape is not realistic and therefore not worth the risk. Think rationally and be cooperative in this sort of situation. The first few minutes are often the best time to resist since there are probably people around you depending on where you are. If this is the case and there are others around you, this is the best time to fight back in a way that will gain others' attention and perhaps provide you with their help. After they have you where they want you (in a car or such) there will most likely be no one who can respond to your petitions for rescue.;
, Your adrenaline will be pumping, your heart will be pounding and you will be terrified. Calm down. The sooner you can regain your composure the better off you will be immediately and in the long run.

, Right from the start, you should try to observe and remember as much as possible in order to help you plan an escape, predict your abductor's next moves, or give information to the police to aid in a rescue or to help apprehend and convict the kidnapper. You may not be able to use your eyes - you may be blindfolded, but you can still gather information with your senses of hearing, touch and smell.

How many are there?
Are they armed? If so, with what?
Are they in good physical condition?
What do they look and/or sound like?
How old are they?
Do they seem well-prepared?
What are their emotional states?


Observe your surroundings:
Where are you being taken? Visualize the route the abductors take. Make note of turns, stops and variations in speed. Try to gauge the amount of time between points. Try counting between each turn, e.g 128 left, 12 right. If you are familiar with the area, this can give you an advantage.
Where are you being held? Take in as much detail as possible about your surroundings. Where are the exits? Are there cameras in place, a lock on the door or other security precautions? Are there any obstacles, such as a large couch? Try to figure out where you are and gather information that may be helpful if you decide to escape.


Observe yourself:
Are you injured or wounded?
How are you bound or otherwise incapacitated? How much freedom of movement do you have?



, There are a variety of motivations for abduction, from sexual assault to ransom demands to political leverage. How you interact with your captors, and whether or not you risk an escape, should depend at least partly on your captors' motivation. If they are holding you for ransom or to negotiate the release of prisoners, you are most likely worth far more to them alive than dead. However, if you've been captured by a serial killer or sexual predator, or if you've been abducted in retaliation for some political or military action, your abductor likely intends to kill you. Your decision of if and when to attempt an escape should be made based on this information.

, Be positive and remember, most kidnapping victims survive - the odds are with you. That said, you should prepare yourself for a long captivity. Some hostages have been held for years but they kept a positive attitude, played their cards right and were eventually freed. Take it one day at a time.

, Be calm. Cooperate (within reason) with your captor. Don't make threats or become violent and don't attempt to escape unless the time is right (see below)., It is generally psychologically harder for a person to kill, rape or otherwise harm a captive if the captive remains ""human"" in the captor's eyes. Do not grovel, beg or become hysterical. Try even not to cry. Do not challenge your abductor but show him/her that you are worthy of respect.

, If you can build some sort of bond with your captor, he/she will generally be more hesitant to harm you.


If your abductor is suffering from a form of paranoid psychosis, it's best that you appear non-threatening, but also avoid doing anything that could be construed as manipulation (such as attempting to befriend them), as individuals experiencing paranoid delusions will likely assume you are yet another person conspiring against them. If they feel they are losing control, they may react with a violent outburst. Do not attempt to convince them that their delusions are unfounded, as they may become enraged, and either way it is unlikely they will believe you (from their perspective, their delusions make perfect sense and seem like reality).

, You may think your abductor is a pathetic, disgusting individual. While captives in movies sometimes get away with saying such things, you should keep these thoughts to yourself. In addition, as in most conversations with people you don't know, politics is a good topic to stay away from, especially if you are being held by terrorists or hostage-takers that are politically motivated.

, Care about what your captor has to say. Don't patronize them, but be empathetic and they'll feel more comfortable around you and more benevolent toward you. Being a good listener can also help you gather information that would be useful for an escape or to help police apprehend the abductor after you're freed.


Appeal to your captor's family feelings. If you have children and your captor also has children, you have a powerful bond already in place. Your captor can probably ""put themselves in your shoes,"" realizing the impact their abduction or death would have on their family. If you have pictures of your family with you, consider showing one or more to your captors if the topic comes up.

, If you are held with other captives, talk to them as much as is safely possible. If you look out for each other and have others to talk to, your captivity will be easier to handle. You may also be able to plan an effective escape together. Depending on the situation, your communication may have to be covert and if you're held for a long time you may develop codes and signals.

, Keeping track of time can help you establish routines that will enable you to maintain your dignity and your sanity. It can also help you plan and execute an escape if you can detect patterns of when your abductor comes and goes and for how long he is gone. If there are no clocks available, you will need to make a conscious effort to keep track of time. If you can see sunlight, it will be fairly easy but otherwise you can listen for changes in activity outside, make note of differences in your captor's awareness level, try to detect different food odors or look for other clues.

, Think about what you'll do when you get back home. Hold conversations in your head with friends and loved ones. Do these things consciously and you won't be going crazy - you'll be keeping yourself sane. Captivity can be boring and mind-numbing. It's important to challenge your mind so you can remain sane, but also so you can think rationally about escape. Do math problems, think of puzzles, try to recite poems you know, remember the lyrics to songs; do whatever you can to keep yourself occupied and mentally sharp.

, It can be difficult to remain in shape in captivity, especially if you're restrained, but it's important to do so if possible. Being in good physical condition can aid in your escape and keep you in good spirits during your captivity. Find ways to exercise, even if it's just doing jumping jacks, pushups, or even pushing your hands together or stretching.

, If you're settled in for a long captivity, gradually ask for small accommodations. Request a heavier blanket, for example, or a newspaper. Keep requests small, at least initially, and space them far apart. You can make your captivity more comfortable and make yourself more human to your captors.

, If you are held with other captives, you don't want to stand out, especially not as a troublemaker.

, If your captors decide to kill you, you need to know as soon as possible so that you can plan an escape. If they suddenly stop feeding you, if they treat you more harshly (dehumanizing you), if they suddenly seem desperate or frightened, or if other hostages are being released but your captors don't appear to intend to release you, be ready to make your best move. If they suddenly stop hiding their identities after wearing masks etc, this is a very strong sign that they are planning to kill you, so escape as quickly as possible.
, When is the right time to escape? Sometimes it's safest to just wait to be freed or rescued. However, if the perfect situation presents itself - if you have a solid plan and are almost certain that you can successfully escape - you should take advantage of the opportunity. You should also attempt to escape, even if your chances are not good, if you are reasonably certain that your captors are going to kill you.

, Hooray - the cavalry is here! Before you get too excited, keep in mind that aside from the first few minutes of an abduction, the rescue attempt is the most dangerous time in a hostage situation. Your captors may become desperate and attempt to use you as a shield or they may simply decide to kill any hostages. Even if your captors are taken by surprise, you could be killed by the actions of police or soldiers, who may use explosives and heavy firepower to enter a building. When a rescue attempt occurs, try to hide from your captors, if possible. Stay low, and protect your head with your hands, or try to get behind some kind of protective barrier (under a desk or table, for example, or in a bathtub). Don't make sudden movements when armed rescuers burst in.

, Your rescuers will be on edge, and they will most likely shoot first and ask questions later. Obey all commands they give. If they tell everybody to lie down on the floor or put their hands on their heads, for example, do it. Your rescuers may even restrain you with zip-ties or handcuffs while they discern who are hostages and who are the kidnappers. Remain calm and put rescuers at ease.

Check the value of your bonds online.,
Cash matured bonds first.,
Cash immature bonds selectively.,
Ensure that you can cash the bonds.",How to Cash Savings Bonds in an Emergency1," You can do this using the calculator at the U.S. Treasury's website. Have your bonds handy when you go to the website. Select the series and denomination of your savings bond from the designated drop-down menus. Enter the issue date of the bond in the appropriate field and click ""Calculate.""


The following page will show you the current value of the bond. Change the date field to see what that same bond would be worth if you cashed it in at a later date.;
, Cash in savings bonds that have already matured before any others. Matured bonds have reached their maximum value and are no longer earning interest. The amount of time it takes for a bond to reach maturity is based on the bonds' series, but most bonds have a base maturity period of 20 years.

, If mature bonds won't cover the cost of your emergency, cash the immature bonds that have come the closest to their earning potential. Start with the oldest bond first; in most cases the earliest savings bond will be closest to maturity, unless your bonds are from multiple series.


Check the interest rates each bond is earning. The rate of the interest was determined at the time you purchased the bond. The easiest way to find out the rate is to use the calculator on the U.S. Treasury's website.
Series EE bonds, from the 1980s and 1990s, have an extended maturity of 10 years beyond the 20-year base. These savings bonds accrue interest for a total of 30 years, and so have the potential to be worth more than their face value.
Consider time of year for bonds bought before May 1997. These bonds accrue interest every 6 months, so you will lose half a year's interest if you cash them right before they have completed a cycle. Cash them for your emergency if they have recently completed a cycle.

, After you have determined which bonds you would like to cash, make sure that you are eligible to cash them. Bonds that are too recent might not be available to cash in an emergency. EE, E, and I savings bonds cannot be cashed until they have matured for a full year. However, if you live in an area that has been affected by a natural disaster, you may be able to cash your bonds early.If your area has been affected by flood, fire, hurricane, or tornado, check the Press Releases section of the US Treasury website to see if you are eligible to redeem bonds that are less than a year old.
If you co-own a bond, you can cash the bond independently of its co-owner.
If you are currently in another country, you will need to sign your request in the presence of the appropriate official. This official could be a US diplomatic or consular representative, an officer of a foreign branch of a bank that is incorporated in the US or US territory, or a notary.if you are in a country that is not included in the Hague Convention, a U.S. diplomatic or consular officer must approve the official's character and jurisdiction.
If you are not a US Citizen, you will also need to fill out IRS Form W-8BEN.

Pack a one person tent.,
Build a shelter from branches or debris.,
Build a snow cave.,
Keep shelters small if it's cold.",How to Build a One Person Emergency Shelter1," A lightweight, portable tent takes up little room in your car. Setting one up is much easier and faster than building a shelter from scratch, if you end up lost or caught in a storm.


This is also a good solution if you may need to leave your home at a moment's notice. Keep food, water, and fuel in the car as well, or in a handheld pack as portable as you can make it.;
, Even flimsy material can greatly increase your odds of survival in stormy or wintry conditions. Refer to the linked article for full instructions, or follow this quick checklist:


Clear a patch of relatively dry ground. Insulate it with a layer of branches or dry clothing. A good rule of thumb to have is 0.91 metres (3 ft 0 in) or more of debris in autumn and fall and about 0.30–0.91 metres (1 ft 0 in–3 ft 0 in) of insulation in warmer weather and 0.61 metres (2 ft 0 in) in rainy weather.
Cover this with a simple lean-to structure. If you have time and rope, lean branches against together and tie them together. If not, just lean branches, cardboard, or anything else against a tree trunk or boulder.
Cover the structure with branches or other debris as well as you can for insulation (or a tarp if available). Pine branches with the needles facing down trap additional air pockets for insulation. A top layer of leaves or trash increases rain resistance.

, Even a bare field of snow can provide shelter if you are able to put in a few hours' work, and the snow is packed enough to form a structure. Pile up the snow into a hillock large enough to fit you, leave it two hours to harden, then dig out a tunnel into the interior.


Pack a compact snow shovel to make this more feasible in emergency situations.
If the snow is too powdery or if temperatures are too high (which could cause a collapse), dig a trench in the snow instead and cover it with a tarp.

, Whichever type of shelter you use, it should be just large enough to fit you. The less space there is, the faster your body heat will warm it. In warm conditions, you want a big shelter so it will keep you protected and cooler than a shelter that is a few centimeters/inches from your face.

Get your papers together.,
Take the bonds to a bank or credit union.,
Cash your bonds through the mail.,
Sell your bonds online at the Treasury's website.",How to Cash Savings Bonds in an Emergency2," Bring identification, such as your passport, driver's license, or social security card. Make sure the name on your bond, your bank account, and your ID match. If your name has changed, bring name change certification or expired forms of identification that include your old name.If you have inherited a bond, you may need to present a certified copy of the death certificate. Call your bank ahead of time to determine their requirements.If you are cashing a band for a child of whom you are the legal guardian, you must bring a copy of the child's birth certificate or other identification materials., If you have an active bank account, you should be able to cash your bonds at your bank with little interference. If you have no active accounts, contact the bank ahead of time to ask their policies on savings bonds. The bank may refuse to cash the bonds, or they may only be willing to cash a certain amount. They might request additional documentation as well.

, Mail the savings bonds to the federal government if you can't find a banking institution to cash them locally. Contact the Treasury Retail Securities office closest to you. Obtain a PD F 5179-1 form from them. Fill out the form and have your signature certified by a notary public. Most banks provide notary services for members. If not, check your local directory for notary republics in your area.


Mail the form, along with the bonds you wish to sell, to the government via certified mail so you have tracking services and proof of delivery.
The Treasury Department will send you a check for the value of the bonds you sold.

, You are allowed to convert some bonds paper to electronic form and sell them online, without having to mail in the physical copies. If you have an electronic bond, you can cash it online. If you would like to convert your paper bonds to electronic bonds, make a TreasuryDirect account and follow the instructions from there."

Construct a long-lasting shelter.,
Learn how to survive nuclear fallout.",How to Build a One Person Emergency Shelter2," No quickly constructed shelter will help you from winds at this strength. Instead, go to a basement, or failing that to a room near the center of a building with no windows.

, A shelter is usually not the best option for an earthquake, although you can prepare in other ways. Earthquake survival is based on two main strategies:


If the tremor is mild and there is a relatively open space outside (no tall buildings), walk to it through the nearest exit. Do not use elevators.
If the tremor is violent or you cannot reach an open space safely, drop under or next to sturdy furniture and hold on.

, If you own a house and are committed to disaster preparation, dig out a basement or dig a bunker. Stock this with emergency supplies in case ordinary services are disrupted. You can also get a FRS or ham radio (you need a license though) for communication.

, An underground bunker is your best bet for protecting yourself from radioactive fallout. In general, the safest areas are indoors, with as many walls and thick furniture between you and the outdoors as possible. Insulating the walls with as much dense material as you can find will protect you further.Seal all vents using duct tape and try to close all doors.

Many landslide-related deaths occur while people are asleep.If you are with other people, work together to keep one another awake.
Watch and listen for warning signs of nearby landslide, including sounds of falling debris or changes in water clarity or flow. It is imperative that you familiarize yourself with landslide warning signs, especially if you live in an at-risk area. Keep reading to learn more about landslide warning signs in detail.;
, Using a battery-powered radio or television, listen to your local news station for updates about the weather. Be alert to warnings about intense rainfall, which can trigger landslides., Sometimes, your local law enforcement will order an evacuation, but other times, they may not be aware of a landslide until it is too late. If you think a landslide is imminent and it is safe to leave, evacuate immediately. Contact your neighbors and your local police or fire department to warn them of danger.Be sure to bring your animals with you.
Don't forget to bring your emergency kit, which contains essential items like food, water, and medication. You'll learn how to make one in a later section.

, If you need to drive to leave a dangerous area, proceed with caution. Beware of flooded roads, collapsed pavement, fallen debris, and washed-out bridges. DO NOT cross flooded streams--instead, turn around and try to find an alternative route., If it isn’t safe to leave the building, but you believe a landslide is imminent, move to the building’s second story, if possible., Landslides move very quickly--much faster than you can run or walk. Trying to outrun a landslide is futile. Instead, remove yourself as fast as you can from the path of the landslide.Before crossing any bridges, always look upstream to see if a landslide is approaching. If this is the case, do not cross the bridge and move out of the path of the landslide.

Stay home.,
Create a safe room.,
Fortify your house.,
Stay informed.",How to Avoid Danger During Civil Unrest1," Most experts agree that the safest place to be during a civil unrest incident is in your home. Staying home keeps you out of the chaos and also allows you to defend your location, if you need to. Don’t go back out to find out what’s going on, and don’t delay getting home if you’re out.You can and should prepare for emergencies, such as civil unrest, bad weather, or any other mass incident. Staying home will allow you to effectively utilize your resources while keeping you safer from danger.;
, A safe room is a specially-designed room in your home that meets Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) standards and is virtually impenetrable to external problems, such as weather incidents, fire, or looters.FEMA’s guidelines primarily ensure that your safe room is weatherproof. You can, however, fortify your room for additional standards, such as fireproofing or bulletproofing.

, Many experts agree that you should also fortify your home, whether you choose to install a safe room or not. Fortifying your home means that you strengthen its barriers, just in case the unrest incident spills over to your location.Invest in a security system that includes outside cameras. This will offer you an additional line of defense.
A popular, basic fortification is replacing standard windows with impact-resistant glass.

, One benefit of our digital age is that we can stay connected pretty easily and have 24-hour access to the news. Make it a point to read up on or listen to what is happening globally, nationally, and locally. Staying informed about current events and any situations that may potentially devolve into civil unrest gives you more time to ensure that you and your family’s safety.Many news organizations have applications for smart phones that will send you alerts if big news is breaking in your area.
Make sure that you don’t just rely on the internet for your information. If a civil unrest situation persists, you may lose internet and cell access.
Consider purchasing a battery-operated or hand-crank operated radio to stay informed if you lose electricity.
A police scanner will allow you hear police radio traffic, which will alert you to any situations long before they are broadcast by the media.

Talk to a geotechnical expert.",How to Be Safe During a Landslide2," Your local community should have a designated public shelter. Go to the shelter if your home is unsafe or the authorities have called for an evacuation.To find the shelter closest to you, text SHELTER + your ZIP code to 43362 (4FEMA). For example, if your zip code is 56789, you would text SHELTER 56789.

, Landslides may recur in the same location. Avoid this area and seek shelter., You should not enter the area where the landslide occurred. However, if you can see people who are trapped or injured in the area, notify the authorities immediately., Infants, the disabled, and the elderly may experience extra difficulty in emergency situations. If it is safe to do so, help your neighbors with special needs. Remember that neighbors with large families may require additional assistance as well., Report any damaged utility lines, roadways, and railways to the authorities. If you are in a building, examine its foundation, chimney and surrounding land to determine if the structure is stable. If the area appears unsafe, leave immediately., Landslides often destroy vegetation. Without vegetation, the area is more susceptible to erosion and flash flooding, which can lead to another landslide. Replanting the affected area helps prevent future landslides., If your property was damaged in the landslide, consider talking to a geotechnical expert to reduce landslide risk. The expert can evaluate your property and determine what modifications, if any, should be made to ensure your safety."

Sticking doors and windows could also indicate warping that precedes a landslide.Broken water lines or other utilities may also be a warning sign.

, Sunken roadbeds and leaning fences, telephone poles, and trees can signal an imminent landslide., A faint rumbling sound that gets louder and louder could indicate an approaching landslide. Sounds like cracking trees or scraping rocks may signal moving debris from a landslide., A sudden increase in creek water levels is a warning sign, as is a sudden decrease in water levels despite recent rain.If you live near a waterway, check the water’s clarity. A change from clear to muddy could mean a landslide is imminent.

Make an emergency kit.",How to Be Safe During a Landslide4," Proper land use-procedures dictate that you should not build near mountain edges, steep slopes, or natural erosion valleys. These areas are prone to landslides., Landslides tend to happen in the same area where they have occurred before. Talk to local officials about landslides in your area. If you are in an at-risk area, consider getting a site analysis of your property. This will help you determine any necessary corrective measures.You should be especially attuned to landslide warning signs if you live in an at-risk area.

, Retaining walls, channels, and deflection walls can shield your property from landslide debris and divert debris flow. If your live in an area that is vulnerable to landslides, consult a professional to see what should be done.Beware—if your channels or deflection walls cause debris to flow into a neighbor’s property, you may have to pay for damages.

, If your area is vulnerable to landslides, talk to an insurance agent to see if your insurance covers landslide-related damage. Although landslide insurance is not usually available, some flood insurance policies cover damage from landslide flows., An emergency kit contains the essentials that your household will need during an emergency. Make your kit in advance so it is ready at a moment’s notice. Your kit should contain enough food and water to last for at least 72 hours, as well as supplies like medications, flashlights, batteries, cell phones, copies of personal documents, and cash.Remember that landslides can cut off services like electricity, sewage treatment, gas, water, and telephones. Pack supplies in your kit that will allow you to deal with these outages.
Choose food that is non-perishable and can be prepared during power outages.

Stockpile resources.,
Form a network.,
Locate a place to meet.,
Practice your plan.",How to Avoid Danger During Civil Unrest2," Whether the civil disturbance is brief, lasts for days, or even weeks, you’ll need access to basic necessities. This especially important because you won’t be able to go out and replenish your supplies. Plan ahead, think about what your family needs (not wants), and stockpile appropriately.


Make sure that you have enough water for every member of your family. The average adult drinks one half gallon per day, and children, sick people, and pregnant women drink more than that. It’s safest to store pre-packaged water, and don’t forget to account for your pets too.Store enough food for your family to survive several days, and remember to consider dietary restrictions, such as Celiac Disease or allergies. Opt for foods with the most nutrition and longest shelf life, such as canned vegetables, stew, and powdered milk. Some foods may even be stored indefinitely.Keep a 30-day supply of medications on hand, if you can, and keep them together so that you can easily stick them in your emergency kit if you need to. It’s also a good idea to make a list of all medications your family takes and the dosages.
Make sure that you have a fully-functional first-aid kit in your supplies.
Have emergency cash on hand in small bills., Having a group of people that you can trust, prepare with, and share resources with is invaluable. Should the unrest remain uncontrolled, your group will rely on one another for survival, as you won’t have access to supermarkets or drugstores., Work with your network, family, and friends to decide where you’ll all meet should civil unrest persist. Remember, cell service will likely not be good in the area, so make sure that you all know exactly where to meet, how to find one another, and when you’ll go to that location.For example, you might decide that if a state of emergency is declared, your group will meet at the predetermined location within an hour of the announcement.
Or you may decide that if roads become blocked, you’ll meet up so that you can evacuate safely.

, Don’t wait until there is a civil unrest incident to find out if your plan to avoid danger and stay safe is effective or not. Practice your plan with your family and your network so that you can work out any kinks and modify your plan as needed. There are emergency plans available on the internet for download that can serve as a good template from which you can develop your own plan."

Secure your home.,
Check your locks and windows.,
Know the law.",How to Avoid Danger During Civil Unrest3," If rioting is imminent, secure your home and business. Rioting often brings looting, and looters can pillage and destroy your property. Make sure your doors are locked, and board up all your windows. Remove small valuables to a safer place if possible, since determined rioters will get in just about anywhere.

, First-floor windows are more vulnerable than others, and doors without deadbolts are less secure. It’s possible that civil unrest incidents can spill over to other areas, such as your house, and you need to ensure that you have adequate locks on all of your doors and windows., It is important to know local laws governing self defense, no matter how you plan to defend yourself and your home. You don’t want to find yourself in trouble after the unrest has been controlled because you violated the law. This is equally important if you are in another city, state, or country.

Register your trip.,
Have a plan.,
Know security protocols.,
Get travel insurance.",How to Avoid Danger During Civil Unrest4," Let your Embassy or Consulate know your trip details so that they can keep you informed if any civil unrest situations occur. Often, they can help you evacuate, should it be necessary, and assist you with resources. Also, they can help you get in contact with your family back home so that you can let them know you’re okay.Every Embassy or Consulate has a website or phone number that you can easily locate on the internet.
When you contact the Embassy or Consulate, ask if there is any additional information or precautions that you should be made aware of.

, You likely won’t know the area very well if you’re travelling abroad. Take some time to learn the layout of the streets, official evacuation routes, the Embassy location, ATM locations, hospital locations, and any other relevant potential sources of assistance.You can typically get maps of travel destinations from your travel agent, from a bookstore, and online so that you can learn the area before you even begin your trip.
Many hotels and local governments offer free maps of the area for travelers. This is a great resource that shows you the layout of the city and, because they’re geared toward travelers, also show landmarks, which can be helpful to know in times of civil unrest.

, Often, local governments will have security protocols for civil unrest incidents that apply to locals as well as travelers. Learn these security protocols so that you don’t put yourself in extra danger and are able to take advantage of any protections the government might offer., You might think that travel insurance is just for missed flights or medical emergencies that happen while you’re on your trip. And while most travel insurance has a specific exclusion for civil unrest, there are policies that you can purchase that will cover this event. If you think that you’re going to an area where unrest is more likely, it is worth the extra work to insure your trip."

Avoid public transportation.,
Don’t fuel the fire.,
Know the official evacuation routes.,
Seek assistance.",How to Avoid Danger During Civil Unrest5," Because streets may be gridlocked, crowded, and potentially violent, avoid public transportation, especially bus and train stations. These places may become hopelessly – and dangerously – crowded if there is even a threat of impending civil unrest. Airports can also become swamped, potentially dangerous places, so it's best to call the airport or your Embassy in advance to check on the situation there.

, Survival experts agree that if you do need to leave your home, do so quietly. Don’t attract attention to yourself, keep your head down, be quiet, and don’t get involved in the unrest. You don’t want to put yourself in unnecessary danger or delay your evacuation., If you live in a weather-incident prone area, your local government may have pre-established evacuation routes. These may be a good option for you, but more than likely they will be at a standstill with everyone trying to leave en masse. It’s a good idea to ask if the state or county has any secondary evacuation routes mapped out and to keep those in mind as well., Whether the civil unrest incident was brief or lasted for weeks, your life will be disrupted to some degree. After the situation is controlled, relief organizations may come into the area to offer food, water, and medical treatment. While it’s still safest to stay home, seek assistance from hospitals and relief organizations if you need it, only when it’s safe to do so."

Assess any safety risks.Take a moment to look around the environment and identify if there are any dangerous objects or hazards.,
Make adjustments to the child's environment to ensure their safety.,
Calm your self.,
Calm the child.,
Give them some quiet time and space.,
Discuss how to make amends.,
Discuss what they will do next time.,
Tell them how you feel.",How to De Escalate a Child in Crisis," Some examples of safety risks are:


Sharp objects
Cords that could become tangled around the child
A set of stairs that could be fallen down
A hot stove or fireplace;
, If you identify safety concerns do what you can to remove them from the child's crisis area. Some things you can do to ensure safety are:


Move dangerous objects to a high shelf or secure cupboard
Stand in front of sharp corners
Physically move to another room - the child may follow you to keep your attention

, This step is easy to skip, but it is very important for a successful outcome.


Take deep breathes
Remind yourself that you can resolve this safety and effectively
Feel the contrast between your calm demeanor and the child's out-of-control one
Let go of planning how you will resolve this
Let go of thinking about discipline or consequences
Let go of worrying about how much time it is taking or may take

, Each situation and each child is different so you must think on your feet and be creative. Their initial escalating behavior may have been attention seeking or manipulative, but a child who has become out-of-control is not doing it to be malicious or cause trouble on purpose. They are acting out because they are not being fully understood and they are angry. Some things you can try are:


Sit near them and speak soft reassuring words.
Let them destroy something that you are okay with (ex: break all their Legos apart, rip all the sheets off their bed, stomp grapes on the sidewalk, etc.)
Tell them you would like to help them but can't do so until they calm down.

, A child who has calmed their body down still needs to calm their mind down. They are likely ashamed of causing such a scene and may be upset or embarrassed about some of the damage they did. Do not proceed to yelling at them or discussing consequences until they have had time to rest and get back to a more stable state of mind. Make sure to tell them you are proud of them for calming down, that you are not mad, and that everything is okay. This will feel counter-intuitive, but shows the child that their acting out didn't phase you and that you are strong and capable of handling stressful situations.

,


Ask the child what they need to do to make it right.
Make sure they clean up any thing they destroyed or damaged.
Have them apologize to anyone who may have been hurt or scared by their actions.

,


Have the child brainstorm what might work better to get what they want.
Come up with more ways to express their anger that are safe and appropriate.

, Make sure you tell the child how their words and actions affected you. If a certain location, person, time of day, activity or object played a role in their out-of-control behavior make sure you discuss it. Did they loose some of your trust? Are you going to stop bringing them to the store because of their inappropriate actions? Will you need to be present next time that particular friend visits? Is their baseball bat no longer a safe toy? Finally, tell them you care about them and will be there for them no matter what happens.

Avoid exposure.,
Be prepared.,
Move to fresh air.,
Flush your eyes.,
Remove exposed clothing.,
Rinse thoroughly with cold water or a neutralizer.,
Wash with soap and water.,
Get medical treatment.",How to Deal With Riot Control Agents," RCA exposure is painful and can be fatal. Avoid exposure if possible by staying away from riots, protests and demonstrations. If you are committed to the cause espoused in a protest, don't let the threat of RCAs deter you from participating, but if you see police donning gas masks, or if you see RCAs being deployed, get away quickly. If you don't have a compelling reason to be at a protest, don't go: RCAs do not discriminate between protesters and passersby, and it's simply not worth the potential suffering just to satisfy your curiosity.;
, Wear clothes that cover as much of your body as possible, and cinch them down at the cuffs. Gas masks are effective against RCAs, but only if they are working properly--used masks purchased online or in military surplus stores may not function well, and older gas masks have been rumored to have asbestos filters. **This is an un-substantiated claim that has spread widely - HOWEVER, older, US-MADE canisters have been confirmed to have CHROMIUM toxicity. Also, NUMEROUS claims are made as to the ""shelf life"" of gas masks. ACTIVATED CHARCOAL, the filter element effective against CN/CS gas, HAS AN INDEFINITE shelf life. ** If you don't have a gas mask, you can use a respirator that covers the nose and mouth--make sure you use filters approved for use with paint thinners and other toxic gases. Alternatively, soak a bandanna or other cloth in apple-cider vinegar or lemon juice and tightly cover your mouth and nose with it. Bring airtight goggles to protect your eyes. Swimming goggles work fine as long as they have a good seal. If possible, don't wear contact lenses. Prepare and carry a solution of water and baking soda (the solution should be about 5% baking soda) to neutralize the chemicals on the skin. Avoid wearing oil-based creams or sunscreens, as these aid absorption of the RCAs.

, The key to minimizing both the severity and duration of the effects of RCAs is to limit exposure. The best way to do this is simply to get away from the chemicals.


Walk quickly, do not run, from the area where the chemicals were released. Running may instigate panic in others. As soon as you detect the release of riot control agents move away as quickly and directly as possible. If the chemicals are released in front of you, you should walk quickly straight behind you to get out of range. Try to get upwind of the point of release.
Avoid visible clouds. RCAs deployed in canisters explode into smoke-like clouds, and clouds can also drift and accumulate, especially in low-lying areas or near the ground. Stay away from these clouds, as they have the highest concentrations of the RCA.
Get to high ground. RCAs are heavier than air, and the highest concentrations thus tend to be near the ground. Don't get down on the ground--it's good to stay upright anyway to reduce your risk of being trampled--and try to get to the highest point possible. This could be up a hill, atop a wall, etc.
Leave the building in the case of indoor release. If RCAs are deployed inside a building, get out as quickly as possible. The chemicals don't dissipate as they would outdoors, and the high concentrations can be extremely dangerous with prolonged exposure.
Get inside if possible. While rarely possible under the circumstances, it may be helpful to get inside a relatively airtight building if RCAs are deployed outdoors. Make sure doors and windows are closed, and try to get to an upper floor. Be aware, however, that if the gas already entered the building through an open window, or if a ventilation system is bringing it in unfiltered, you will need to evacuate the building and get to fresh air. Fresh air, especially if a breeze is present, is preferable to the stale indoor air if you have already been exposed to an RCA.

, If your eyes are burning or if your vision is impaired, do not rub your eyes. Remove contact lenses and flush your eyes thoroughly with cold water for at least 10 minutes. Do not put the exposed contact lenses back in.

, Once you are out of range of the gas take off all your clothes that may have been exposed (this usually means everything down to your underwear). If you are wearing a pullover shirt, cut it off rather than bringing it over your head. Do not put these clothes back on. Seal them in a plastic bag and leave the the bag at the scene--hazardous waste specialists generally come to clean up after RCAs are deployed--or take it with you so that you can clean the clothes later.

, Hot water opens the pores, which causes more of the RCA to be absorbed through the skin. Rinse your whole body in cold water for 3-5 minutes--a shower or hose works perfectly--but do not scrub or apply soap yet. Touching your skin will spread the chemicals and rub them in. If you have a neutralizing solution, such as the baking soda solution mentioned above, apply this liberally all over your body, paying special attention to exposed areas or burning, red, or itchy skin. Many RCAs can be rinsed out of the eye with milk. Fill a shot glass about half full with milk, hold it up to the affected eye and tip your head back, blinking a few times to make sure you rinse well. As your rinse, whether with water or neutralizing solution, try to position yourself so that the water runs directly off each part of your body, instead of trickling down from your head to your toes. The water that comes off your body will be contaminated, so make sure not to get it in your eyes or on other people.

, Shower with warm water and soap only after you have thoroughly rinsed with cold water. It's important that you shower; do not take a bath.

, In many cases, you will not need medical treatment, but if symptoms persist once you are thoroughly clean, if you experience severe symptoms or loss of vision, or if you experience pain in your chest, see a doctor or other health professional immediately.

Stock up on emergency supplies.,
Have an emergency family plan.,
Secure your property.,
Know what you are up against.,
Have emergency names and numbers on-hand.,
Know who you can trust.",How to Prepare for a Catastrophe," After 9/11 many American families have created special emergency kits to help them survive in the event of another tragedy. Regardless of the threat, an emergency supply kit can help you to stay alive during the early days following an outbreak or disaster. Items you should include:


Water. One gallon per person per day. If it’s possible, maintain at least a three day supply.
Non-perishable food. Choose food that is easy to open, easy to store that does not attract bugs (or zombies). Also, select items that provide enough calories and nutrition to sustain life for several hours such as energy bars, peanut butter and nuts. If you have a baby, maintain a week’s supply of formula or baby food. Since you probably won’t be able to run your dishwasher, keep a pack of plastic forks, spoons, paper plates, paper towels and plastic cups on hand.
Prescription and non prescription medication. Since you can’t anticipate when a disaster or zombie attack could possibly happen, always keep an extra month’s supply of prescription medicine on-hand. Non prescription medicine should include pain relievers, antihistamines and anti-diarrhea medication.
First aid kit. You don't want to be bleeding all over the place regardless if you are running from zombies or trying to survive a natural or man-made disaster. Pack bandages of all sizes, blister bandages and a few ACE bandages. Include antibacterial cream to avoid infection.
Toiletries. Most likely your electricity will be disconnected, so maintaining supplies that will keep you clean (and smelling fresh) will be vital to your survival. Include deodorant, waterless shampoo and antibacterial waterless hand soap. If you have a baby, don’t forget diapers and wipes.
Tools. Put yourself in the shoes of a Boy Scout and think about the tools you might need to survive in the wilderness. Pocket knives, duct tape, flashlights, bleach, batteries, candles, matches and a hammer are a good place to start.
Pet supplies. Don’t forget about the family pet. Same rules apply to Fido in terms of food, water and medication.
Generator and gas. In the event you lose electricity following a disaster, keep a few cans of gas in the garage and have your generator primed and ready to go at any minute. Test your generator every year to ensure it’s still in working order and have it flushed after each use.;
, Chances are you will be taken by surprise during a disaster of zombie-like proportions and in order to stay one step ahead, gather the troops and have a “what if” discussion. Review the family’s daily schedule and identify a “go to” safe spot in the event of a disaster like a zombie attack. Determine how you could come together as a family once the area has been deemed safe or cleared. Could you walk home if necessary or will you require car, bus or train transportation? If you typically ride public transportation and there is no way you can walk home, identify a peer who has a car and find out if you could get a ride, should disaster strike. You should also consider what to do if you can’t locate a member of your family. Who will be elected to go on the search and when? Ultimately your best bet would be to communicate by cell phone, however you can’t depend on the network to be up and running--that’s why a solid emergency plan is imperative.

, During emergency situations, ""good"" people can do terrible things. In addition to having to worry about the usual dangers lurking outside, anarchist looters may try to move in and take what’s rightfully yours. Think about what it will take to secure your home and personal property from harm’s way.


Examine all locks on windows and doors. Do you have any doors or windows that don’t close properly or are broken? Have all entryways to your home evaluated by a professional to ensure that no one could forcefully enter your home?
Lock cars and secure recreational toys such as motorcycles, boats and jet skis.
Bring in outdoor items that could be used as weapons or could become air born. Looters (or angry zombies) could use items such as large potted plants and lawn furniture to smash windows. Also, during a hurricane or tornado, those items could become flying ""missiles"" and create endless amounts of damage.

, Every disaster situation is different and hopefully government agencies are communicating with the public every step of the way. However, during the early days following an outbreak or disaster the public is often on their own. Examine your unique situation and consider the safest way to conduct yourself until help arrives.


Look for dangerous patterns within the community. If you know that you will be in the most danger at night, don’t go outside at that time. Be hyper-aware of your surroundings and never let your guard down while in public or outside.
Make your trips into the community brief. In addition to being worried about being eaten during a zombie attack, most disasters will wreak havoc on structures--power lines may be down and on the ground and building materials may line the street. You could actually survive the disaster but then be electrocuted because you didn’t see the downed power line on the sidewalk.
Practice safe behavior. If you could become infected with a deadly disease or be attacked on the street, don’t spend your day hanging out in the town’s square. Use your common sense and make every effort to avoid trouble.

, From national to local government agencies; many have planned for a variety of disaster scenarios and should have a hardwired plan ready for implementation. Stay informed by trying to contact your local officials first and then state and national groups if you don’t get answers immediately.

, You don’t have to be suspicious of the little old lady down the street, but it’s good to know which neighbors will have your back. Keep a list of emergency friends and family members near your emergency kit. You may want to have a discussion or an agreement with neighbors before disaster strikes to know how you can help each other.

Contact your local weather bureau if you aren't familiar with the local climate or want to be certain.;
, Designate an interior room as your shelter, without windows and with the most distance between you and the outside.

, Stock enough nonperishable food and bottled water to last for at least three days or longer. Store other food related items such as utensils and can openers as well.

, Collect plenty of spare clothing, weather gear, blankets, shoes, etc. to store in your shelter. Since tornadoes often strike at a moment's notice, you won't always be wearing the right clothing when you need to make use of the shelter.

, These are the last items you'll want to forget in the event of a tornado.

, The items and materials inside it can help you attend to minor injuries in the aftermath of a tornado.

Clean the lint filter after every use.,
Replace your foil accordion vent pipe with a rigid metal pipe.,
Clean inside, underneath, and behind the dryer.,
Avoid drying items that have been exposed to combustible materials.,
Check to make sure that there is space between the dryer and the wall.,
Avoid running the dryer while you are away or asleep.",How to Reduce Laundry Room Fire Hazards1," Lint is highly flammable, so allowing it to build up in your dryer’s filter is dangerous. Before you start a load of laundry, make it a habit to pull out the lint filter and wipe it clean. You also need to check around the vent pipes and ducts to make sure that they stay clear of lint.Don’t throw the lint on the floor because it will continue to be a hazard; instead, take it to the trash can or keep a small can for lint in the laundry room.
Pop off the vent where it hooks into the dryer to check for built-up lint.Lint is so flammable that it’s a common ingredient in fire-starting recipes.Keeping your lint filter clean will also allow your clothes to dry faster.
If you live in an apartment building with a shared laundry facility, ask your landlord if they can post signs reminding people to clean the lint filter.;
, Many dryers have a foil vent pipe that can collect lint that easily gets stuck in the folds of the vent, becoming a fire hazard. You can prevent lint build-up by replacing the vent pipe with a sturdy metal vent, which will not collect the lint., Lint and other debris can build up in the spaces surrounding your dryer. Heat or a spark from the dryer can ignite the flammable materials, causing a fire. You can reduce the risk of fire by dusting and sweeping around your dryer once a week to keep it lint free.If you live in an apartment with a shared laundry facility, check the area around the dryer to see if it's clean. Talk to your landlord if you see a lot of lint debris around the dryers. Say, ""I noticed that there's usually a lot of lint around the dryer. Did you know that that's a fire hazard?""

, If you’ve gotten oil, grease, or gasoline on a piece of laundry, don’t put it in the dryer because the heat could cause the item to catch on fire. Instead, line dry the items to keep your laundry room safe.If you use a shared facility in your apartment complex, ask your landlord about posting a sign or sticker reminding people not to dry items that have been exposed to combustible materials.

, Your dryer needs clearance from the wall so that air can circulate around it to cool it down. If the heat cannot escape, then it can easily overheat. Additionally, your vent pipe needs space so that it doesn’t get bent or compressed. If it does, the lint could build-up., Dryers are the most dangerous when they’re unattended because it’s easier for something to go unchecked. Turn off your machine if you have to leave the home or are about to go to bed. It’s better to have damp clothes than to have a house fire.

Call a professional to install new appliances.,
Look for frayed wires and damaged cords.,
Avoid using an extension cord.,
Watch for signs of damaged machines.,
Get your machines checked annually.",How to Reduce Laundry Room Fire Hazards2," When you purchase new appliances, it can be tempting to save money by installing them yourself; however, you may not install them correctly, which could result in hazards. Call a handyman or hire representatives from the store where you purchased your appliance to install the appliances for you. While it’s an added upfront expense, it will help you keep your home safe.

, Frayed wires and damaged cords can not only start a fire, they can also cause electric shocks. Unplug affected cords and immediately repair or replace them.Keep laundry and other materials from building up around the cords as this could create a fire hazard or disguise your damaged cords.

, Extension cords can only handle so much wattage before they overheat and become a fire hazard. Additionally, they are meant to be a temporary solution to an electrical need and are not meant to be relied upon regularly. You should always plug your appliances directly into a wall socket.You should also never plug an appliance into a two-prong outlet. Make sure that you are using an outlet with a surge protector., A damaged washing machine may leave you with soapy or sopping wet clothing, while a broken dryer won’t be able to completely dry your clothes.


Machines can get damaged by items left in pockets, so remember to check them while you load the machine., Ask your handyman to do a maintenance check on your machines once a year to make sure that they’re in good working order. This will allow you to repair your appliances before they become a hazard."

Read the care labels on your clothing.,
Hang your clothes in a safe location.,
Use your iron safely.,
Avoid piling laundry on the floor or appliances.,
Avoid storing combustible materials near hot appliances.",How to Reduce Laundry Room Fire Hazards3," If you care for fabrics incorrectly, then you could create a fire hazard. For example, some materials cannot be placed in the dryer. Make sure that you read all of your clothing labels so that you do not accidentally create a hazard., If you line dry items, make sure that they are located away from heat sources, such as your dryer, iron, or radiator. If the clothes came in contact with the hot appliance, they could become a fire hazard.Even if they don’t catch fire, you could damage your clothes.

, Because your iron is small, it’s easy to overlook it; however, irons are still a source of heat. If you accidentally leave a hot iron laying with the hot side down, it could ignite the item it’s on, especially if it’s on your ironing board.


Always check your iron to make sure that it’s turned off before you walk away.
Make a habit of not leaving your iron with the hot side down.
To stay safe, unplug your iron between uses.

, Piles of laundry can create a hazard by overheating a power cord, hiding damage, or falling behind machines. Instead, store both clean and dirty laundry in either laundry baskets or a hamper.

, Items like paint, stain removers, gasoline cans, or chemicals need to be stored away from your hot appliances, such as your dryer, iron, hot water heater, or radiator.If you can store the items elsewhere, it’s best to relocate them to an area that doesn’t have so many heat sources.

Take a nap.",How to Not Get Bored when the Power Goes Out3," If it is still light outside, use your power outage as an excuse to go outside and get active. Your mind will focus more on moving and breathing, and less being bored. If it is dark outside, you can still do some simple exercises inside, such as stretches or yoga. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Bike ride
Jogging
Jumping jacks
Stretches or yoga
Walk around the block
If you live in a good neighborhood and the weather is nice, send the kids outside to play., Having no power at home is a great opportunity to get out of the house and do other things. If the people you are visiting don't have power either, be sure to bring along some candles, games, and snacks. You can have a fun game night while you wait for the power to come back., Is there anything in your house that needs painting or repairs? Does your bathroom need thorough scrub? So long as there is enough daylight, there is plenty you can do in your house. By the time your power is back, you might even have a sparkling-clean bathroom and a freshly-painted bedroom.

, If the weather is decent, you can always pack your car, and go on a road trip. You don't have to go far. You can even go to the park or the library. If there is a big city or national park close to you, you can drive there and spend the day exploring. By the time you come home, the power might already be back.

, When all else fails, you can always take a nap. You may end up having a great, exciting dream.More importantly, you will wake up feeling refreshed and energized. You may have more motivation to do things you'd usually find boring (such as cleaning), or you may get some ideas for new projects (such repainting your cabinets or working on a painting).

Have some source of light ready.,
Keep your electronics charged at all times.,
Have some arts and crafts items on hand.Try to keep everything in one box.,
Have some special toys that the kid only gets to use during blackouts.",How to Not Get Bored when the Power Goes Out4," This includes things like flashlights, electrical lanterns, batteries, candles, lighters, and matches. When choosing candles, try to get a pillar candle. They will be less likely to get knocked over, and will last much longer than stick candles.


Batteries expire. Check your stash every year and throw out any that have leaked or expired.
Candles made from liquid paraffin are smokeless and odorless. They are great for indoors.Get some of those solar-powered garden lights. Charge them during the day, then use them at night. You can hold them, or prop them up in jars.
Glow sticks don't offer much light (at least not enough to read by) but they can be fun to play with.

, This way, when the power goes out, you can still use your electronic readers, music players, and movie players. You might even want to get one of those portable chargers for your electronics. This way, when your electronic runs out of battery power, you can plug it into the portable charger, and enjoy it for a little bit longer.

, This way, you will have everything on hand during the next black out. If you have small children, consider making this a ""special blackout box."" Young children seem to find anything that comes out of a ""special"" box more exciting to play with.Listed below are some crafty items you might want to consider having:


Sketch books, coloring books, activity books, or notebooks
Pens, pencils, coloring pencils, crayons, or markers
Scrapbooks and scrap-booking supplies
Glitter and glue
Glow-in-the-dark paints
Colorful yarn, knitting needles/crochet hooks

, This will make the toy feel like new each time the kid plays with it.Some examples of special toys include:


A special light-up toy that the kid can draw on or play with
A packet of glow-sticks is a safe bet for just about any child
Glow-in-the-dark paint and glitter will make even nighttime crafting fun
Arts and crafts kits

Ask for details of the abduction.,
Take down the child’s information.,
Ask for information about the suspected abductor.,
Request information about the abductor’s vehicle.,
Determine that the child has been abducted.,
Identify the child’s risk of bodily injury or death.,
Check that you have enough descriptive information.,
Confirm the child’s age.,
Get the form.,
Complete the Reporting Agency Information.,
Submit the form.,
Enter data into the National Crime Information Center system.",How to Request an Amber Alert," You will want to know where and when the abduction took place. Also try to get other relevant information about the abduction which could aid in finding the child:the identification of any witnesses
whether the person reporting the abduction suspects the child is in serious danger
why the child is in serious danger;
, You will need detailed information about the child before you can issue an alert. Accordingly, you should request from the child’s parents the following information:name
age and date of birth
height
weight
sex
race
eye color
hair color
what the child was wearing
any other unique physical characteristics
a photograph of the child

, You also need detailed information about the suspected abductor. Gather the following information:name
age and date of birth
sex
race
height
weight
eye color
hair color
what the suspected abductor was wearing
any unique physical characteristics
a photograph of the abductor, if one is available

, The abductor might be identified by the vehicle he or she drives. Accordingly, you should gather this information as well:make
model
year
color
license plate number and state
any other descriptors for the car

, Before submitting the AMBER alert, law enforcement should reasonably believe that the child has been abducted. This is a judgment call you have to make.However, your state might have specific guidelines. For example, in Texas, an abduction occurs in the following situations:if the child is abducted by a parent or legal guardian, the abduction was in the course of an attempted murder, or
if the child is 13 or younger, he or she was taken without permission by someone unrelated and more than three years older or by another parent or legal guardian who attempted to commit murder at the time of the abduction

, You can only issue the alert if you believe the child faces serious risk of bodily injury or death. The danger must also be “imminent.”This means that it will happen very soon.Accordingly, you should look at all of the information that you have and decide the child’s level of harm.
The purpose of this requirement is not to overburden the AMBER alert system with regular abduction cases where the child does not face substantial bodily injury or worse.

, An alert will only be effective if the descriptions of the child, the abductor, and the abductor’s vehicle are sufficiently detailed that law enforcement will be able to find the child.Remember that AMBER alerts can be sent out over the radio, Department of Transportation signs, digital billboards, and other mediums.Law enforcement and public citizens who see the alert need to be able to identify the child or abductor without a photograph. For this reason, you need sufficiently detailed information.

, You can only send an alert if the child meets your state’s age criteria. The age will vary depending on your state. However, the federal government has required that states honor each other’s requests if the child is under 18.For this reason, most states have an age limit of 17 or younger.

, There should be a form for you to fill out and send to your state agency. You should ask someone in your department for the form. Alternately, you could look online to see if your state’s form has been published.

, Each state’s form will be different. However, you will probably need to enter information about your department. Enter the following information legibly:whether this is an initial request or an update
the agency’s name and contact information
the name and title of the investigating officer
the investigating officer’s cell phone number
a phone number for media inquiries

, The form should tell you how to submit the AMBER alert request to your state’s centralized office. Typically, you can email the form or fax it. Look at the form to find the email address and fax number.If you email the form, then make sure to keep a copy saved to your desktop so that you can refer back to it if you need to.

, Not every jurisdiction requires this step. However, entering the information into the FBI’s database will allow the alert to be broadcast across state lines.


Be sure to flag the case as “child abduction” after entering the necessary information."

Pay attention to astronomers’ predictions on any possible collisions with earth.,
Move away from coastal areas.,
Move into a bunker or fortified structure and outfit it with an energy source.,
Purchase enough food, water, medicine, and other supplies.,
Buy weapons and ammunition for after the impact.,
Ration your food and water.,
Limit your generator usage and only use it if necessary.,
Listen to the radio to stay in communication with society.,
Keep yourself physically healthy.,
Keep your mind active and stay mentally healthy.,
Make sure the environment is safe before going out into the world.,
Scavenge for additional supplies and food.,
Prepare to defend yourself from desperate survivors.,
Move to a fertile place near the equator and plant vegetable seeds.,
Create a governance system for your new society.",How to Survive a Comet Hitting Earth," NASA currently has astronomers that track comets that are flying in our solar system.As a result there’s a very good chance they will know if there is a large object about to collide with us. By listening to their predictions you can develop a real sense of how much time you have to prepare.


Check back with the NASA website as they constantly update close calls.
Make sure to prepare well in advance. Sometimes astronomers know about potential impacts on the earth only a couple months beforehand.;
, Because the earth is made up of 71% water, there’s a greater likelihood that the comet will hit a body of water.If this does happen, it could mean that giant tsunamis would be created by the initial impact and they would likely destroy our coastal cities. Additionally, there would be an increase in water vapor entering our atmosphere which would cause heavy rain, which could cause landslides and flooding.The tsunami in India in 2004 killed 150,000 people in a single day with many more left missing.The results of a tsunami from a large comet impact would be even worse.
Even if you had an impenetrable bunker near the coast, massive flooding would mean you could never leave it.

, An underground bunker isn’t only the best for the time of impact, it will also protect you from environmental hazards after the comet has hit. When the comet hits, dust, soot, and water will shoot up into our atmosphere, making it cold for months to years.For that reason, make sure you also outfit your bunker with an energy source for heat, like a generator and enough fuel to last while the dust in the atmosphere settles. If you're unable to get a bunker, make sure to fortify whatever structure you're going to be staying in so that it can withstand the blast. Buildings that have strong foundations and are lower to the ground are better.


If you can't find a bunker, try to find another location that's going to be unaffected by the impact. This could be a cave or another natural structure that would shield you from the initial blast.
There are many different bunker options available, but the best ones for a comet impact will have an air filtration system and be made of strong material.
Bunkers can be expensive and range from anywhere from $20,000 to a million dollars and upwards., If the comet does hit on land, dust and rock particles flying into our atmosphere will make it too dangerous to go outside for months to years. Make sure that you have enough food that’s able to stand the test of time. A radio, handheld transceiver or walkie-talkie, and flashlights are other important pieces of gear you should stock up on.


Make sure to stock your hide-out with canned food, dried goods, non-perishable foods, and bottled water.
If there is more than one person staying in your location, make sure that you increase the amount of food you are storing accordingly.
The average calorie intake for men is 2,500 calories a day and 2,000 calories for women., You may be more concerned with withstanding the destruction of the comet impact itself, but you also need to be conscious of the possible dangers of other people after the dust settles. If you are fully prepared for a comet impact and others are not, people may want to steal your resources. You should be ready to defend them unless you have enough to go around.


Don’t go crazy on purchasing guns, make sure that you have things like food, water, and shelter before spending money on protection.
A semi-automatic rifle and a pistol with enough ammunition should be more than enough firepower.

, The amount of time that the repercussions of a comet impact would negatively affect the outside environment varies on a variety of factors, like how large the comet was, where it impacted, and how close you are to the site of impact. Because of this, rationing your food and water may be crucial for your survival, as there’s no concrete amount of time you will need to sustain on your food stores.


Dried legumes, canned beans, and dried meat products provide the most protein and can be stored for a very long time. Nutrient rich grains and potatoes can also provide needed calories, so make sure to be stocking up on these kinds of food.As a rule of thumb try not to dip below 500 calories a day. While humans are capable of surviving without food for up to 40 days while hydrated, not eating enough will deteriorate your body and mind.Make sure you are eating the right kind of foods so you don’t suffer from malnutrition.

, Your generator will be a lifesaver for many things while you are in your bunker. You can use it to produce heat, cook food, and power lights. Because most generators run on fuel, it’s important that you limit it’s usage because it’s likely you will have a limited amount of fuel in your bunker. If you aren't in a bunker, a generator may still work, but there's a good chance that main power grid will be down.


It’s a good idea to have more than one generator in case your primary generator breaks.
Equip your hide-out with generator repair kits for possible repairs that will be needed.

, There may be efforts from the government to try to help people during this catastrophe. Make sure to listen to the radio to see if there are any updates or initiatives that can benefit you. If there are people on the radio, they will likely be able to give reports on the environment outside.


Don’t believe everything you hear. Early reporting is notoriously inaccurate at times, so wait it out until you hear unified reports.The National Weather Service broadcasts emergency broadcasts on the VHF public service band which require a special radio receiver. These channels range from 162.400 to 162.550., Any physical ailment while you are hiding out can develop in life-threatening illness because of the lack of medical care available. A small cut could get infected, or a cold could develop into a chest infection. For that reason you should attend to any medical issues as soon as they arise.


While you ration your food and water you’ll probably want to keep physical activity low, but you should also make sure not to become frail while in your bunker and try to get exercise in if your food stores will allow it.

, It will be very easy to be negative during such a catastrophe, so make sure that you keep an active mind. Solitary confinement has been proven to have negative physiological affects on people, so it's important that you use what you have around you to stay mentally acute. Reading books, talking to other people, and doing activities will ensure you aren't stagnating and keeping your mind healthy.Isolation has multiple negative effects on your mental health, so having people with you is a good idea if you want to stay mentally healthy., Use a portable air monitor to test the air outside and make sure that the levels are normal before venturing there. You also need to make sure that any fires or flooding caused by the comet have subsided. Acid rain is also a potential result from massive fires putting pyrotoxins into the air, which would make going outside deadly.Have a reason to go outside, like you’ve run out of food or supplies or hear about other groups of people who survived and want to join them.

, Whatever the comet did not destroy can be salvaged for use, like food, batteries, water, or anything else you’d find useful from abandoned stores and houses.


Make sure that you are not stealing from anyone and that the goods have been abandoned by their previous owners to avoid confrontations.
There is a chance that the location you try to scavenge in has already been sorted through depending on the length of time you’ve been hiding out.

, If you’ve managed to survive the comet impact, there’s a good likelihood that others have as well. Hunger breeds violence and people will want to your steal supplies in order to survive.Always try to resolve things peacefully, not violently.
There may be other groups willing to share resources as long as you share yours.
Always approach people cautiously, but not in a hostile manner.

, Non-perishable and canned food won’t sustain you forever, so you will have to get used to hunting and gathering your own food. Designate different people based on their strengths to search for food. Moving near the equator will be warmer and if the dirt is fertile, this will allow you to begin to grow food for consumption.


Having more people in your group will allow you to search for food more effectively.
Moving near a large body of water will allow you to fish.
Use survival guides to determine what foliage is good to eat and what is poisonous.

, A popular vote is a direct democracy and would work so that everyone had a voice in matters that affect the group. While having a final decision maker or leader is conventionally how smaller groups tend to act, having everyone’s voice be heard will hopefully ensure less fighting in your group.


As your group gets larger, the governance system becomes more critical.
Make sure to hold everyone to the same standards.

"
"
Remain calm at all times.,
Make sure that the social order really has broken down, rather than some local disturbance, such as a riot, uprising, or strike.,
Take measure of your overall surroundings.,
Consider storing 2 weeks to 3 months supply of items that will make your life easier during a period of social breakdown.,
Consolidate your immediate support networks: friends, close coworkers, family, and neighbors.,
Venture out to procure your needed supplies.,
Having secured your supplies, it will be time to consolidate things back at home.,
Having created your small community, secured a supply of resources, and taken charge of its leadership, you will be well prepared to wait out the social breakdown until the rule of law is restored.

,
If it is truly catastrophic, resulting in national destruction and a regression of civilization, you will need to take further steps to ensure that your community becomes the nucleus for the rebirth of society.

",How to Survive a Breakdown of the Social Order," There may be lots of frightened, desperate people wandering in the aftermath of a breakdown of the social order: this is the greatest danger of all. Do not give in to panic -- it impairs rational thinking and adds to the overall chaos.;
,


If you have access to media, check local radio and television news stations, or dial to an emergency station. The government, if communications systems are still functional, should be broadcasting emergency information alerting its citizens of the danger.
Remember: a social breakdown is not caused by a specific disaster, but arises out of the actions of individual people

,


Ask yourself: What resources do I have access to? What do I need? Where do I go to get what I need? What don't I need? A clear list of essentials is vital to making a solid survival plan.

, If you are stockpiling supplies, you may not want to make it publicly known. You don't want everyone converting your house into the new local grocery store.


Warm clothing is essential if you live in a climate where it gets cold. Electricity and natural gas may become unavailable for weeks. Have good coats, warm blankets sleeping bags, winter boots, gloves, hats, etc.






Water: If you can stay warm your next essential will be drinking water. The water pressure may fail for any number of reasons. Of course, your hot water heater is one source of drinking water but it may be filled with sediment. Consider storing water in food grade containers in case of an emergency. 5 gallon (18.9 L) containers can be moved if needed. 55 gallon (208.2 L) barrels are great but impossible to move in an emergency. Store 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water per person per day. A family of 4 will need at least 120 gallons (454.2 L) to survive 30 days.






Sanitation: You're warm and have plenty to drink. The next essential is keeping clean or sickness will quickly become devastating. If there is no water pressure, the toilet can be flushed by dumping a gallon of water into the bowl after use. Try to use old dish washing or bathing water. Don't waste your drinking water. If there is no water or functioning sewer establish a latrine or a waste bucket far from sleeping eating and living areas. Use a bit of that drinking water to wash hands. It is worth it to stay healthy.






Defense: Often, in social breakdown, there are people who may be very dangerous and violent due to the lack of law enforcement. One must defend what resources they have from theft. During the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Korean business owners were able to defend their businesses with firearms from being looted and burned by rioters. Owning a weapon and sufficient ammunition may be critical for survival. Also, one must know how to maintain and use the weapon in case a situation might arise. Just make sure that the weapon is legal and if applicable, registered.







,


No man is an island; it is crucial to remain connected to a community if one is to survive a breakdown of government. Make sure that your loved ones are safe by keeping them close by.

,


Be aware: in the immediate aftermath of a disastrous breakdown of the social order, if you are in an urban area, there will likely be many, many people looking for the same thing. Looting will be rampant and widespread, and in the chaos, you may not be able to reach your ideal supply centers.






Have contingencies in mind: cast your net wide, but locally. Do not venture too far from your base of operations in search of needed supplies, and if other people are willing to fight you for it, back away. The key is to be adaptable and to survive.







, This will call for you to become an effective leader: oftentimes even a well-prepared group can break down due to internal tensions.


Keep a level head and try to be fair and impartial in dealing with difficult or stressful situations between people.






You will all be under a great deal of stress: try to encourage stress-relieving activities, such as plenty of exercise, board games and puzzles, reading, and investing time in learning useful practical skills.






Delegate resources efficiently and according to need. Although some will obviously want special treatment, remember to keep in mind that your resources are limited. If necessary, use triage.






Give everyone a useful task. Idle hands are the devil's plaything.






Resolve arguments before they can occur. If you sense tension or anxiety growing between two people, try to get the issue out into the open before it can turn into a potentially deadly confrontation.






If conflicts are unavoidable, try first negotiating a compromise: speak to each person involved on a personal basis -- don't try to be a dictator. Calm spirits by speaking in a firm, but soothing tone. If the situation continues to degenerate, get friendly, neutral parties to restrain the combatants.

Store the water.,
Treat stored water if you intend to keep it longer than 6 months.,
Label and cycle water.,
Learn how to treat water if needed.,
Store where it is easy to access.,
Know where else to get water from in an emergency.",How to Store Water for Home Survival," Add up the following to work out how much water you need to store (for a minimum of 3 days, preferably for longer) - each figure is daily:


For drinking, each person should have 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of potable water
For personal hygiene, each person should have 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of potable water
For sanitation (toilet), each person needs 2 to 7 gallons (7.6 - 26.5 liters) but this doesn't need to be potable water (drinkable water). If you are able to dig a pit toilet in your backyard, this level can drop a little provided you cover personal hygiene needs (hands, and cleaning up any fecal matter from the skin, such as for babies and diarrhea sufferers).
Don't forget pets. They will also need clean drinking water.;
, Don't leave an air gap.

, It is recommended that you have a variety of containers of varying sizes. While a tank or barrel of water might be a fantastic source of storing a lot of water, what if you have to take only what you can carry to go and survive somewhere else? What if older, frail, or sick people are left to fend for themselves and have to carry heavy water loads? A mixture of container sizes is better for covering all possible eventualities.


Choose food grade plastic for water storage containers, or storage tanks made for storing rainwater. Don't use plastics that will contaminate the water.
In the USA, you can use FDA approved DOT #34 opaque containers.

, The length of time water can be stored is dependent on the container used, the temperature, the ability of light to get to it, etc. Contaminated water is no good to you, so follow these guidelines:


Use opaque containers for water. If you are buying bottled water as a back-up, revolve it every few months and replace with newer stock and either use the old stock or water your plants with it.
Store all water away from light. Don't give algae and other lifeforms the chance they're waiting for to grow.
Store the water away from anything that could contaminate it such as pesticides, fungicides, insecticides, gasoline, paint, or any other chemicals.
Don't store the water where it can freeze outside. An ice block isn't going to be useful when you have no heat to melt it. One exception to this is those living in a hot climate can store some of the water in the freezer as it will melt in the heat.

, If you don't want to treat the water, cycle it with fresh water and dispose of the stored water (or use it to water the garden).

, You need to date each bottle of water so that you know when it needs to be cycled. One rhythm that it's good to get into is changing your water supplies at the same time as placing new batteries in your smoke alarms and changing the clock for daylight savings.

, Water from the mains won't need treating, just cycling. Water from sources that are not treated can be treated as follows;


Use four drops of unscented household bleach per gallon of water (1 drop per liter of water).
Mix through well.
Alternatively, use a solution from a camping store or disaster preparation store that is made just for the purposes of treating water. Read up to find the one best suited to your needs and preferences.

, Think of storing it in different parts of the house in case there are problems getting to it, such as a collapsed or shut-off area. Having some in the garden shed or garage might be a good idea too.

, There are some other possible places to get water from in your home:


The hot water cylinder and header tanks contain potable water if supplied by mains water
Toilet cistern water is safe if you haven't used a chemical cleaner in it
Swimming pool water can be used for washing and sanitation but never drink it
Rivers and streams near your home can be used for fire-fighting purposes only; they are highly likely to be contaminated.

Seek medical attention at the onset of symptoms.",How to Survive a Chemical or Biological Attack," The flu vaccine that is currently used for seasonal flu will not work against any Chemical or Biological Attack. New strains of the virus require new vaccines, and these can take months or years to develop and even longer to produce and distribute on a large scale.;
, Should a pandemic of any kind flare up, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other governmental and non-governmental organizations will provide information on the spread of the disease, as well as updates on vaccines or other medications, tips for keeping yourself safe, and travel advisories. The WHO and CDC, as well as various national governments, already have websites in place to provide useful planning information to the public. Newspapers and TV and radio broadcasts will also help disseminate critical warnings and advice.

, While the current vaccine won't protect you from every flu or any other ""new"" strains of the virus, it can help you stay healthy (by protecting you some flu virus strains), which may in turn help your body to fight the virus better if you do become infected.

, In past Chemical or Biological pandemics, many victims succumbed to secondary pneumonia infection. While the pneumonia vaccine cannot protect against all types of pneumonia, it can improve your chances of surviving the pandemic. The vaccine is especially recommended for people over the age of 65 or those who have chronic illnesses such as diabetes or asthma.

, Two antiviral medications, Tamiflu and Relenza, have shown the potential to effectively prevent and treat avian flu. These are both available only by prescription and will probably be effective only if taken before infection or very shortly afterward. It should be noted that additional testing is necessary to determine how effective these drugs really are against avian flu. Furthermore, mutations in the avian flu virus may render them ineffective in time.

, Hand washing may be the single most powerful defense against avian influenza and many other infectious diseases. If pandemic strikes, you should wash your hands several times a day. Make sure that you use proper hand washing technique.

, Since it's probably not feasible to wash your hands every time you touch something that may carry the virus, you should carry an alcohol-based hand cleaner with you at all times. These cleaners come in a variety of forms, and can be used any time you need a quick touch-up. Keep in mind, however, that the use of these cleaners is not a substitute for thoroughly washing your hands, and they should only be used to supplement hand washing.

, Right now, the only documented way to become infected with avian influenza is by coming into contact with infected birds or poultry products, and these routes of infection will continue even if the virus mutates so that human-to-human transmission becomes the greatest threat. Avoid handling any thing the infected has already touched, and try to prevent domestic animals (such as house cats/dogs) from coming into contact with Infected. If you work in proximity the dead or living infected, for example--take precautions such as wearing gloves, respirators, and safety aprons. Cook all foods thoroughly, to 165 °F (74 °C) throughout, and exercise proper food-handling techniques, as you would to protect yourself from other threats such as salmonella. Proper cooking kills the most virus.

, The most effective way to prevent becoming infected is to avoid exposure to infected people. Unfortunately, it's not possible to determine who is infected and who is not--by the time symptoms appear, a person is already contagious. Social distancing, deliberately limiting contact with people (especially large groups of people), is a reasonable precaution to take in the event of a pandemic.

, If you're sick or if others at your workplace have become sick, you should stay away from your workplace even in the absence of a pandemic. Given that people will generally be infected and contagious before they exhibit symptoms, however, during a pandemic it's essential to stay away from places, such as work, where you have a high probability of being exposed to an infected person.

, A pandemic can last for months or even years, and waves of intense local outbreaks can last for weeks, so it's not like you can just take a few sick days to protect yourself from workplace infection. If possible, try to arrange a work-from-home situation. A surprising variety of jobs can now be accomplished remotely, and employers will likely be willing--or even required--to try this out if a pandemic strikes.

, Any parent knows that kids pick up all kinds of bugs at school. Avoid public transportation. Buses, planes, boats, and trains place large numbers of people in close quarters. Public transportation is the ideal vehicle for widespread spread of infectious disease.

, During a pandemic, governments may cancel public events, but even if they don't, you should probably stay away from them. Any large gathering of people in close proximity creates a high-risk situation.

, The most virus can be spread through the air, so in the event of a pandemic it's a good idea to protect yourself from inhalation of the virus if you're out in public. While surgical masks only prevent the wearer from spreading germs, respirators (which often look like surgical masks) protect the wearer from inhaling germs. You can buy respirators that are designed for one-time use, or you can buy reusable ones with replaceable filters. Use only respirators labeled as ""NIOSH certified,"" ""N95,"" ""N99,"" or ""N100,"" as these help protect against inhalation of very small particles. Respirators only provide protection when worn properly, so be sure to follow the instructions exactly--they should cover the nose, and there should be no gaps between the mask and the side of the face.

, Gloves can prevent germs from getting on your hands, where they can be absorbed directly through open cuts or spread to other parts of your body. Latex or nitrile medical gloves or heavy-duty rubber gloves can be used to protect the hands. The gloves should be removed if torn or damaged, and hands should be thoroughly washed after removal of gloves.

, Some Illnesses can be spread if contaminated droplets (from a sneeze, or spit, for example) and then enter the eyes or mouth. Wear glasses or goggles to prevent this from occurring, and avoid touching your eyes or mouth with your hands or with potentially contaminated materials.

, Gloves, masks, tissues, and other potential bio-hazards should be handled carefully and disposed of properly. Place these materials in approved bio-hazard containers or seal them in clearly marked plastic bags.

, If a pandemic strikes, many of the basic services we take for granted, such as electricity, phone, and mass transit, may be disrupted temporarily. Widespread employee absenteeism and massive death tolls can shut down everything from the corner store to hospitals.

, Discuss emergency preparation with your family. Make a plan so that children will know what to do and where to go if you are incapacitated or killed, or if family members cannot communicate with each other.

, In the developed world, at least, food shortages and disruption of services will likely not last more than a week or two at a time. Still, it's essential to be prepared for such an event. Store a two-week supply of water for everyone in your household. Keep at least 1 gallon (3.8 L) per person per day in clear plastic containers.

, Opt for non-perishable foods that don't need to be cooked and that don't require a lot of water to prepare.

,, The effectiveness of antiviral medications decreases as the illness progresses, so prompt medical treatment is imperative. If someone with whom you have had close contact becomes infected, be sure to seek medical care even if you do not display symptoms.

Know how to survive extreme natural situations.",How to Survive," Is your house sturdy enough to stand up to heavy winds, flooding, and extreme temperatures? Shelter is a basic survival need, so make sure yours is up to the task of keeping you and your family safe no matter what occurs. Take the following measures to ensure your home will protect you in the event of an emergency:


If you live in an area where earthquakes might happen, make sure your home is earthquake-proofed. If you rent your house or live in an apartment building, talk to your landlord about taking this precaution.
Have a fire safety plan in place. Make sure you won't get trapped in your house if a fire starts. The doors and windows should all open easily. Rooms on the top story of the building should either have an accessible fire escape or a portable fire escape ladder that can be attached to the window and let down to the ground.
Check your home's insulation. Make sure there aren't cracks around the windows in doors that let drafts from the outside in. If the power goes out, you'll need to keep warm air in the house and cold air out, or vice versa.
Consider getting a generator for backup electricity. This is especially prudent if you live in an area with very cold winters; you may need to heat your home when the temperature drops.;
, Whether it's a cellar, a basement, an attic, or another type of storage area, you'll need a waterproof, sun proof, break-in proof room to store your survival supplies.


Line your storage area with plastic waterproof tarps so your supplies don't get damp or moldy.
Make sure there are no cracks or other entryways for bugs, mice, and other creatures to enter your storage area and get into your supplies.
Have shelving in place to keep food and other supplies off of the ground, where they can get more easily damaged.
Install a lock on the door to keep your supplies safe from intruders.

, When disaster strikes, you want to have enough food and water to tide you over until you can get fresh supplies. It's impossible to know how long that will be, so it's wise to have enough food and water to last for at least several months.


Get enough gallons of water to sustain your entire family for a few months. Remember that you'll also need water for hygiene, cooking, and other purposes.Choose nonperishable food items that fill basic nutritional requirements. Canned meat, vegetables, fruits, beans, and soups are good choices. Dried flours, fruits, beans, pasta, rice, and so on will last a long time without spoiling., Go beyond just having a first aid kit and stock up on several months worth of supplies you might need in an emergency. Keep your medical supplies in a watertight, airtight container in your storage area. Make sure you have plenty of the following:Pain medication






Bandages
Rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide
A thermometer
Supplies to make a splint
Tweezers and scissors






Antibiotic ointment







, You'll need appropriate clothing for all types of weather. Stock up on clothing that is waterproof, boots that will protect your feet in the snow, and other clothing that is necessary for survival in your specific environment.


Wool and other wicking fabric is better for survival purposes than cotton, which holds moisture against the skin.






Keep several changes of clothes in your storage area.

, Make sure your car is always in good repair in case you have to leave the area. Have extra canisters of gas ready in the event that gas is inaccessible at stations. Keep your trunk stocked with a first aid kit, blankets, other other essential items you might need if you have to hit the road.

, Having a conversation with your family about what to do in the case of a disaster is one of the best ways to ensure survival. Come up with a plan that works for your area and takes into account the type of disasters you may face - hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, and so on.


Figure out where you can get to safety if you ever have to leave the house in a hurry.
Have a signal you can use to alert your family when it's time to take action. Make sure everyone knows their part to play, whether it's getting the pets to safety, making sure the windows are closed and sealed, filling jugs with water, and so on.
Have a plan in place in case your family members get separated. Make sure people know where to go and how to find each other.

, In extreme cases you might have to leave your home to escape an emergency situation. You won't be able to bring all your stored items with you; you'll have to take what you can fit in a backpack. Prepare a ""grab and go"" pack for yourself, and one for each of your family members. Fill it with enough supplies to last a week or so.


The pack should include a change of clothing, enough dried food to last a week, enough water to last a week, a small water filter, purification tablets, waterproof matches, a small first aid kit, a map of your area, emergency contact information, and a copy of your family's survival plan.
Place the packs in easily accessible locations so that you and your family can grab them and run if you need to.

, You can only store so much water in preparation for a disaster; eventually, you may have to procure your own clean supplies. Fresh water from streams, rivers, creeks and lakes almost always contains pollutants in this day and age, so knowing how to filter and purify water is a very useful and crucial survival skill.


If you don't have a water filter, you can make one using charcoal, pebbles and sand.
When you run out of water purification tablets, boil all of your drinking water.

, Learn what wild plants, berries, tubers, and other natural food sources are available in your area. Take a class from a naturalist in your region, or go to the library and learn about the rich resources in the woods, wetlands or other natural areas near you. Learn about animal food sources as well. Learn how to catch, clean and cook fish.
Learn which insects are healthy to eat.
Learn how to hunt squirrels, rabbit, and deer. Knowing how to field dress animals you hunt is also essential.

, You'll need to know how to find dry moss or bark that will catch fire, lay kindling around it to get it burning hot, and build the fire up with pieces of slow-burning wood. Knowing how to build a fire is a basic survival skill you'll need for keeping warm, cooking, sanitizing supplies, and many other purposes.

, In a survival situation, you might find yourself in the position of providing medical care to someone in need. You'll have more confidence if you take classes and get certified in basic first aid and more advanced procedures.


Know how to administer CPR to adults, children and babies.
Know the proper way to treat shock.
Know how to treat hypothermia.
Know how to save someone from drowning.

, You're not going to be able to make an appointment with a mechanic if you're on the run from some kind of disaster, so it's a good idea to have some basic mechanic skills under your belt. When your car breaks down, there will be no one but you to figure out how to fix it.


Learn how to fix a stalled car.
Know how to stop an engine from overheating.
Review your specific car model and get familiar with how your engine operates.

, Surviving an emergency situation may put you in the position of needing to hike long distances, carry a very heavy load, endure extreme temperatures, perform manual labor, and stay healthy without a lot of food and water to keep up your strength. Keeping physically fit before disaster strikes will put you in the best position to survive.


Build endurance by taking time to walk or run long distances several times per week. Practice taking steep hills and exercising in very hot and cold weather.
Work on building muscle so you'll be able to lift heavy objects and walk long distances with a pack on your back.
Knowing how to swim is also an important skill to have if you're going to be near water.

, Every region in the world has a different type of threat to take into consideration. What sort of disaster is likely to threaten safety in your area? It's important to know what disaster preparedness measures are recommended by your local officials.


Make sure you know what to do if you hear a warning siren go off. Depending on your region, it may mean that you need to take shelter, move to a secure location, or take some other type of action.
If the weather seems threatening, turn on the radio and follow any instructions you might hear.
If officials are advising that you evacuate the area, get to a safe location as fast as you can.

, The severity of storms across the world is escalating. Knowing what safety measures to take in the event a severe storm strikes greatly increases your chances of survival.


In the event of a tornado, take shelter. Get to a secure underground or windowless location; don't go out driving.
If a hurricane strikes, you might need to evacuate to get to a secure, safe place.
To survive an earthquake, drop to the floor, cover your head, and hold on tight until it's over.

, If you end up having to face the elements without secure shelter, you'll need to know how to survive exposure to extreme cold, heat, and other natural occurrences. Do your best to be prepared for the following situations:


If you're in a snowy place, you'll need to know how to survive in the snow and deal with an avalanche. Remember that snow is itself an effective insulator, so making a snow cave to ride out the worst of the snowy weather is a good way to survive.
If you find yourself in a cold body of water, don't use up all your energy swimming; stay still and find something to keep you afloat until someone else comes to your rescue.

Protect yourself from dust and sand by wetting a piece of cloth and holding it over your face.

Protect yourself from the sun to prevent getting heatstroke.
Know how to protect yourself from animal attacks in case you encounter sharks, bears, wild dogs, bees, or other animals that might threaten you.

Look for signs of a tsunami.,
Listen for official communications from authorities in your area.,
Monitor communications during a tsunami.",How to Stay Safe During a Tsunami1," If you’re near the water, you should always be aware of signs of a potential tsunami. If you don’t know the signs and watch for them, you could potentially be taken by surprise by a tsunami. Warning signs include:

Quickly rising or decreasing waters along the coast.
An earthquake.
Animals, such as birds, fleeing in the opposite direction of the water.;
, Perhaps the most effective way of staying aware of a possible tsunami is to be tuned in to local warning systems. You can do this by signing up for text messages, being tied into an automated phone warning system, or listening to loudspeaker announcements in public areas.

The authorities will issue a tsunami watch when a tsunami may exist and could be moving toward your location.
The authorities will issue a tsunami warning when a tsunami has been verified by monitoring stations., While listening for initial warnings or watches is important, it is very crucial that you continue to listen for updates during the event. This is because the authorities may be able to direct you to a safer evacuation route.

Keep your cellphone by you during the event.
Turn your radio on low during the event."
"
Look for cover if you feel an earthquake.,
Gather your family.,
Move to higher ground.,
Follow your evacuation route.,
Wait for authorities to signal an all clear before returning to affected areas.",How to Stay Safe During a Tsunami2," Since earthquakes are one of the most obvious signs of tsunamis, you need to make sure you are safe during that event. If you feel an earthquake, take cover under a doorway, table, or somewhere similar.

Remember to drop to the floor and take cover., After you suspect a tsunami is on its way, you should take a minute or two to organize your family. Make sure you know the location of young children, your significant other, and elderly relatives (if they are with you). Explain to everyone that they should follow you closely.

If you can do so safely, you should also gather pets and bring them with you when you evacuate., Once you become aware of an impending tsunami, you need to immediately move away from the shore and toward higher ground. The pace at which you move to higher ground may have a substantial impact on whether you survive the tsunami.

Try to move at least 2 miles (3.2 km) from the coast or 100 feet (30 m) above sea level. Ultimately, though, the higher and farther inland you go, the safer you will be.
While trees or tall buildings aren’t a recommended way to survive a tsunami, if you have no other option, you should move as high up as you possibly can., While your immediate goal is to move to higher ground, you should try to stick to a pre-planned evacuation route if possible. This is important, as following an evacuation route will limit the chance of you inadvertently putting yourself into danger., One of the biggest dangers of a tsunami event is the chance of continued tsunamis or large waves. Because of this, wait until you get official word from local authorities before you return to low lying areas."
"
Put together a tsunami preparedness kit.,
Plan evacuation routes.,
Familiarize yourself with the area around your evacuation route.,
Create a contact plan with your friends and family.",How to Stay Safe During a Tsunami3," Your kit should include food and water for a couple days, a radio, batteries, first aid supplies, and a flashlight. Your kit will not only provide you with items you may need during and after a tsunami event, but it will give you piece of mind while you are evacuating., Perhaps the most important part of preparing for a tsunami is creating evacuation routes to high points inland. By plotting several different evacuation routes, you’ll limit the amount of time you may have to waste figuring out where to go during a tsunami. Create plans that will take you from:

Work to a safe zone.
Home to a safe zone.
Likely places you may be in your community to a safe zone., Take the time to drive or walk the route several times in advance. Look for alternative ways to cross rivers, streets, or get around major buildings.

By familiarizing yourself with your evacuation route, you’ll be much more likely to be able to avoid dangers like downed power lines or damaged bridges., A contact plan will let you know how and when to communicate with friends or family after you have evacuated. You should also include a place to meet friends and family after authorities have signaled an all clear.Choose a location that is easily accessible and in a safety zone. Possible locations include a friend’s house, a public park, or a landmark.
Make sure you include a timeline for communication in your plan. For example, have a first contact time (maybe 1 to 3 hours after the event), a second contact point (6 to 12 hours after), and a third contact point (a day after the event).

When you breathe in, try to breathe from your stomach, not your chest.,

Scream in a higher pitch.,

Try to avoid tipping your head back to do so.,

Do not utilize this next tip as a first choice.,

Don't be afraid to keep it up.,

Try to avoid gasping.,

Do not stop screaming.,

Though you may feel inclined to breath in through your nose, do not do that.",How to Scream As Loud As You Can (if in Danger)," This requires practice.

Put your hand on your stomach and breathe out, feeling your abdominal muscles contract. When you breathe in, they should expand. It should feel like sipping through a straw.
Imagine drawing air from the bottom of your lungs, not the top. Do this a few times until it feels comfortable and you can do it without pressing a hand to your stomach. A practice scream should feel like something (namely your stomach muscles) is pushing it out of you by contracting around your lungs. It should not hurt.;
, Higher notes are generally more audible. They cause longer soundwaves, which hit people's ears that much harder. Even if you're male, let loose like a little girl. (Don't try to hard, mind you. Forcing your voice into a high note that is incongruous with your usual tone or higher than natural for your voice can cause minor injury.) Also, screaming higher and, if it so happens, shrilly, usually indicates fear more than a macho war cry. You're trying to say ""Help me!"" not ""I'm bad news!"", You may assume that a higher note means ""I should hold my chin higher"", but tilting your head backward can actually put excess strain on your vocal chords and make it harder to produce sound. So don't do it.

Optimum volume is achieved when you hit the perfect note, frequency, and force of exhalation. This is the level at which glass shatters and dogs howl. If you can't get this amplitude, don't sweat it. Usually only professionals can. If you get anywhere close, count it as a success. In the best case scenario, you'll be loud enough to temporarily deafen your assailant. Don't count on it.

, You should try to stay as far away from your attacker as possible, but if you're forced anywhere close to him or her, put your mouth as close to their ear as you can to scream. It's generally painful on their end of things., Even if your throat rips, don't stop that scream. Saving your neck is more important than sparing your windpipe. If you have to stop because you're hit or run out of air, drag in another breath and scream again., Even if it seems to waste time, taking a deep breath only takes about a second, two if you really draw in, and a longer, louder scream is more effective than one that is short-lived and oxygen-deprived., This cannot be emphasized enough. No matter what does or does not happen, is or is not inflicted upon you, keep screaming until help arrives. Even if you manage to incapacitate your attacker, keep screaming.







Of course, if and when help arrives, preferably law enforcement, you can stop the pipework and breathe. If you continue to scream, mostly likely they will assume hysteria has set in or at the very least become irritated.






If you are able to escape, run away screaming while calling your country's emergency number (like 911) on your phone. Scream into that. Police will respond even if it's wordless. If you don't have a phone, yell loudly at passerby to call the police, the person behind you is an assailant, and that it's real, not a joke.

, Your nose IS the most direct passage to the lungs, but don't let that fool you. Breath in through your mouth, as you let more air in that way. When time matters, you want to get the most air in in the shortest time."

Check for and repair any leaks in your home.,
Install water-efficient appliances.,
Turn water off when not in use.,
Reuse water that would have been wasted.,
Water your lawn sparingly.,
Participate in meetings about water conservation.,
Campaign the local government to practice water conservation.,
Patronize businesses that practice water conservation.,
Push for laws to control and clean pollution.",How to Prepare for a Drought," Serious droughts can result in water shortages that could last weeks or months. With proper rationing and conservation, however, you and your household can hold out for several weeks on stored drinking water. If you live in a drought-prone area, it would be a good idea to have a plan in place for what you'll do in the event of a drought. By drawing up a plan, you and your family can be prepared for when a drought does hit.Humans require about 3/4 gallon of water daily just to live. Including water usage for sanitation, you should plan on each person in your household using a gallon of water per day. Keep this figure in mind when stocking or gathering water.Also bear in mind that certain people will require more water than others. Usually children, nursing mothers, and people with chronic illnesses need more than a gallon a day. If you have any of these particular cases in your household, plan accordingly and stock more water.Also keep some extra water stocked in case of a medical emergency. If someone gets sick or injured, they'll need to drink more to stay hydrated. You also will need the water to clean any wounds.Make sure everyone in your house knows the limits on water usage in the event of a drought.
If a situation gets dire and drinking water is getting scarce, don't ration to the point of dehydration. Lost hikers have been found dying of dehydration when they still had water left because they were trying to conserve. Drink what you need to stay alive.;
, Remember that each person in your home will require at least a gallon of water daily. To be properly prepared, have enough bottled water to last your entire household at least a week. This water should be used as a last resort in a drought. Use it only if drinking water gets cut off entirely., Thousands of gallons of water fall on your property every year. Take advantage of this by harvesting some of it. You can stock this rainwater for drought-conditions by using it to water your lawn and cleaning. In the meantime, you can use it to take a good chunk out of your water bill. Installing one is easy.Get a large drum (55 gallons is usually standard) from a hardware store. Get several if you plan on storing the water.
Place the drum under a downspout gutter and run the gutter into the drum.
If you don't have gutters on your house, place the drum under a section of your roof where water usually runs off.
Rainwater must be thoroughly filtered before drinking. You should generally only drink it in an emergency situation after boiling for three minutes., Leaky pipes can waste thousands of gallons of water per year. Not only will this waste precious water if a drought hits, but it will run up your water bill during normal times. Thoroughly check your home for any leaks and repair them to increase your preparedness for a drought.


Check the faucets in your kitchen and bathrooms. Also look at the handles of faucets, since water can escape here as well.Check your toilet to make sure no water is escaping from the back of the tank into the bowl. Add food coloring to the tank. Don't flush and check back in 30 minutes. If there is color in the bowl, you have a leaky seal in the tank and should get it repaired.Take a reading of your water meter. Then wait 30 minutes without using any water and check it again. If there is any difference, you have a leak somewhere. If you can't locate it, call a plumber to investigate., Household appliances often use much more water than they have to. Upgrade certain appliances in your home to water-efficient versions to save money and conserve water in the event of a drought.You can get a low-flow shower head to save water while you shower.
Install a low-volume toilet to avoid wasting water while flushing., It is a bad habit to keep the faucet running when brushing your teeth or shaving. Instead, you'll save a lot of water by turning the faucet off while your brush or shave., There are numerous ways that household water gets wasted. Instead of letting water flow down the drain, collect it and put it to better use.Think about when you run the shower or faucet and wait for the water to warm up. This can take several seconds to a minute, during which time water is running down the drain. Place a bucket in the sink or shower when you do this, then use that water for plants so you don't have to use the hose.

, Over-watering your lawn is a big waste of water. Lawns usually only need to be watered once a week during the summer. Set an alarm to remind you to turn off the sprinkler to avoid over-watering. Also, don't water if you've had heavy rain recently.Some localities, particularly in dry places, have laws about when you can water your lawn and for how long. If droughts are expected, governments may ban watering altogether. Check with your water company or county government to ensure that watering is permitted in your area before watering your lawn.

, Many towns in drought-prone areas meet regularly and discuss water policy. If you're concerned, you should attend these meetings and participate. Do all you can to promote efficient water usage. Give suggestions if you have them and, if you think it's necessary, organize local citizens to campaign for certain changes.Local governments often advertise meetings of this sort. Check local newspapers or your local government's website for notice of meetings.
If you can't find any meetings advertised, try calling your town or city hall and asking if any upcoming meetings will discuss water policy.
It's possible your local government doesn't discuss such issues. In this case, you can form a committee of citizens to petition the government to take action on water conservation. Read Be a Community Organizer for ideas on how to organize fellow citizens.

, Just as you took steps to conserve water in your own home, you can also petition the government to do the same. Organize citizens and call for water-efficient devices and practices in government buildings and offices., For example, some restaurants serve water only upon request, which saves resources. Show your support for these establishments by using their services and telling your neighbors about them., Water pollution is a big problem if a drought hits. The community will have less water it can use in the event of rationing if local rivers, streams, and lake are polluted. It is a matter of public interest to clean up local water sources to prepare for a drought."

Read the manufacturer's instructions.If you have never used your generator before, or if you haven’t used it in a long time, it is critical to read all instructions and safety information provided with the generator.,
Set the generator in a proper place.,
Check the fuel level.Your generator should have some sort of fuel gauge.,
Check the generator’s oil level.Generators need oil to lubricate their running parts.,
Inspect the generator’s air filter.Your portable generator takes in air as part of the combustion process it runs to produce power.,
Flip the circuit breaker off.Your generator will have a switch that controls when it puts out power.,
Turn on the fuel valve.This control determines when fuel flows to the generator’s engine.,
Start the generator.Using your generator’s “START” switch or key, power the machine up.,
Connect your devices.,
Turn the generator off.When you no longer need the generator’s power, or when you need to refuel the generator, you should turn the machine off.,
Keep an adequate supply of fuel for your needs.,
Turn the generator off and let it cool before refueling it.While it can be inconvenient to turn off your source of power when you most need it, trying to refuel a hot generator can be dangerous.,
Inspect your generator regularly.It is important to keep your generator in good working order.,
Buy the right generator.,
Never use a portable generator indoors.Portable generators can produce deadly fumes and carbon monoxide.,
Never operate a generator in rainy or wet conditions.Generators produce electricity, and electricity and water make a potentially deadly combination.,
Never plug a portable generator directly into a wall outlet.,
Store the generator’s fuel properly.Use only approved fuel containers, and store the fuel according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",How to Use a Generator," Before attempting to start the generator, take a few minutes to read over the information provided by the manufacturer so that you understand how to safely operate the machine.


Consider storing safety information with the generator so that it is easy to find when you need it in a hurry.;
, Generators can get hot and noisy, and produce dangerous fumes. Keep the generator outdoors, in a dry location, at least 3 feet away from anything else, and at least 20 feet away from any open doors and windows., Make sure that the generator's fuel tank is adequately filled before starting the machine. Add more of the appropriate fuel, if necessary.

, Following your generator’s manufacturer’s instructions, check the oil level of your generator before starting it up. Add more oil (using only the type specified by the manufacturer), if necessary.

, The filter traps dirt and debris, to ensure that the air the generator takes in is pure. You must inspect the filter before starting the generator. If it is dirty or clogged, clean or replace it according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

, Make sure that it is safely in the “OFF” position before starting the generator.

, The generator needs the fuel in order to run and produce power, but you should not flip the fuel valve on until you are ready to start the generator.

, You should let the generator warm up and run for several minutes before switching the circuit breaker to the “ON” position (check your generator’s instructions to see exactly how long it should warm up).

, Many generators allow you to plug electronic devices directly into the generator.You may also use an approved extension cord. Choose one that is heavy-duty, outdoor-rated, and has a grounding pin.

, First, flip the circuit breaker to the “OFF” position. Then, turn off the machine using the generator’s power switch or key. Finally, set the generator’s fuel valve to the “OFF” position.

, The amount of fuel you can store may be limited by laws, regulations, safety considerations, and storage space.Try to keep enough around to power the generator for as long as you need it.


Check the manufacturer’s instructions for tips on how long your generator will run on each tank of fuel. This can give you a sense of how much fuel to keep on hand.
Use only the type of fuel recommended by the generator’s manufacturer. Using an inappropriate fuel can be dangerous, and can void the generator’s warranty.
Common fuels used for portable generators include gasoline and kerosene., Turn the machine off and wait 15 minutes to refuel. You can minimize the inconvenience by scheduling a refuel of the generator at an off-peak time, such as when your family is asleep.

, Since it may sit unused for long periods of time, you should schedule regular inspections (at least once per year). Make sure that all the parts are clean and that there is fresh fuel in the tank.


Store the generator according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Run the generator for a short time about once a month to make sure that everything is working properly, and that the machine’s parts stay lubricated., If you are shopping for a generator, get one that will supply the amount of power you will need.Labels and other information provided by the manufacturer should help you determine this.You can also ask an electrician for assistance. If you connect devices that use more power than the generator can produce, you run the risk of damaging either the generator or the devices.


If you have a relatively small furnace and city water, you can probably power most household appliances with between 3000 and 5000 watts. If your home has a larger furnace and/or a well pump, you can expect to probably need a generator that produces 5000 to 65000 watts.Some manufacturers have a wattage calculator to help you determine your needs.Generators approved by Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM) have undergone rigorous inspections and safety tests, and can be trusted., When these become trapped in enclosed or partially-ventilated spaces, they can build up and cause illness and even death. Enclosed spaces can include not only rooms inside your house, but also a garage, basement, crawl space, etc. Carbon monoxide is odorless and colorless, so even if you don’t see or smell any fumes, you may be in danger if you use the portable generator indoors.


If you feel dizzy, sick, or weak when using a generator, get away immediately and seek fresh air.Keep your generator at least 20 feet away from any open windows or doors, as fumes can enter your home through these.You can install portable, battery-operated carbon monoxide detectors in your home.These work much like a smoke or fire alarm, and are a good idea to have at any time, but especially when you are using a generator. Inspect these regularly to make sure they are working and have fresh batteries.

, Set your generator on a dry, level surface. Keeping it under a canopy or other covered area can protect it from moisture, but the area must be open on all sides and well-ventilated.


Never touch a generator with wet hands.

, This is an extremely dangerous process known as “backfeeding,"" since it runs power back into the grid.It can harm you, electrical workers trying to repair a system during an outage, and your home.


If you want to have backup power connected directly to your home, you must have a licensed electrician install a power transfer switch and a stationary generator.

, Usually, this means in a cool, dry place, away from your home, flammable material, and other fuel sources.

, You will want to know if a mob is rushing towards your BOL (Bug Out Location).

, Anyone can be your enemy. Don't let anyone you don't know well and don't know if they won't do anything bad into your BOL. Never, ever.

, Music, games and activities can help to keep the morale up.

Gather sufficient supplies to survive for 90 days.,
Obtain and stockpile basic survival (the most important) items.,
Store supplies for just getting by.,
Prepare an emergency kit.,
Keep yourself healthy against everything.,
Plan how to prepare for the messier sides of the long-term.,
Set up a communication system.,
Use diesel-powered vehicles.,
Become a good shot.,

Become less dependent.,
Find a way to generate your own electricity.",How to Survive an Apocalypse1," Surviving after a major apocalyptic event is not going to be short term since the entire country or the world is likely to be falling apart––there are no two ways around that reality. However, hopefully having three months of supplies will get you settled and going with your new self-sufficient habits. The more time you have dedicated to forming a plan when disaster 'does strike, the better. When preparing the supplies, think in two categories: basic survival and getting by, as outlined in the following two steps.;
, Consider storing the following:


Jugs of water
Canned goods
Vacuum-sealed goods
Blanket and pillow
Medications
A weapon that you actually know how to use properly
A knife (in addition to a weapon)
Warm, long sleeved clothing (if your climate requires it)
Carrying bag (for moving and/or fleeing).

, Think about having these items at your disposal:


Batteries
Flashlights
Matches
Pot (for cooking or boiling water)
Plastic eating-ware (plate, mug, spoon, fork)
Rope or twine
Map
Permanent markers (something to write with)
Change of clothes
Can opener
Lighters
Camp stove and propane
Hatchet or axe
First aid book
Sunglasses
Duct tape
Glow sticks
Boots
Extra pants
Smartphone
Water filters
Other comfort items.

, Whether you're on the lookout from cannibals, flesh-eating super-bacteria, zombies, or a meteor, you'll need to think about your health. Here's a list for what you need to put in your emergency kit:Adhesive bandages, such as Band-Aids
Gauze
Medical tape
Antibiotics (not for the zombie virus but for normal bacteria)
Antiviral drugs (not for the zombie virus but for normal viruses)
Ibuprofen (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID))
Acetaminophen/paracetamol (over-the-counter pain relief)
Antihistamine
Aspirin (over-the-counter pain relief)
Laxative
Iodine
Potassium Iodine
Hand sanitizing liquid
Candles
A multi-use tool (aka a ""hobo tool"")
Phone charger (preferably solar)
Wood for burning
Towels
Life jackets, if your area is prone to flooding
Extra warm clothes
Paper towels
Solar charger (see below)
Pet food (enough for 30-90 days)
Tweezers
Plasters
Safety pins
Thermometer
Superglue
Toothpicks/needles.

, You'll be dealing with everything from cuts to dysentery. Hospitals will cease existing and simple problems will seem a lot more daunting. If you or a family member has a specific ailment, stockpile medications for that, too.

, That's a nice way of saying, ""Everybody poops."" To keep hygiene from being an issue on top of everything else, pack the following:


Toilet paper (a couple rolls will suffice)
Menstrual products
Toothbrush and toothpaste
Plastic garbage bags and ties
Shovel or trowel
Bleach
Soap and shampoo

, Everyone in the household and close family and friends should have a communication system to communicate with family and friends. Communicate secret locations with your family members and friends using the radio.


Keep batteries with your radio. The last thing you want is to presume you're prepared when you're really not. And if you have a loved one you're taking care of, make sure they have a radio and you're not keeping both of them for the two of you.
When all else fails, work out how you will contact each other. This is when your permanent markers will come in handy. If the apocalypse strikes and you have left the house, write down where you are going, when you left, and if/when you'll be back on the wall, on a rock, on a nearby car, wherever you can find.

, Hoarding gasoline won't work; the chemicals that once kept it fresh will degrade it in time. After a year or so, it goes bad. Chances are gas stations will run out of gasoline but there could be some diesel left. In addition, all military diesels can run on other fuels as well, from rotten kerosene to fermented leaves. So invest in something that can handle the harder fuels.


In said vehicle, it's equally as likely that you'll be in it when all breaks loose, so pack a survival kit to keep in your car as well. Is there such a thing as being too prepared?
If this isn't an option, make sure you have a bicycle laying around somewhere that's fully functioning. There will be a point when you need to cover large distances in a short amount of time.

, Knowing how to work a gun is going to keep you from either dying or being voted off the island.. And while you're at it, buy a couple (if you haven't already).Regardless of who or what you'll be facing, this is probably a good idea. Anything menacing needs to be kept far, far away. Whatever or whoever your enemy, shooting them will probably increase your chances of not being attacked or eaten.

Unless the apocalypse is due to some bacteria that's floating around in the air. In that case, get a gas mask. The people/zombies/menacing forces will probably still see you as an enemy.



,


Master the art of the snare trap. If you're really scrappy with it, you need nothing but what nature provides you.
If you're on the ocean or near a body of water, get to fishing or fly fishing. Your stock of baked beans and Spaghetti O's certainly isn't going to start spawning miraculously.
Take a hint from Katniss and start honing your archery skills. Once you've got a reason, learn how to make your own bow.

, Take the time to read through wikiHow's disaster preparedness section. Read every novel on every version of apocalypse you can. Even though such novels are ""fiction"", reading about how the characters scavenge for food, retain water, and find shelter might just be the thing to save your life.However, do not rely on these as your only preparation.


Examples of books to read include: The Road by Cormac McCarthy, Lucifer's Hammer by Larry Niven, Alas, Babylon by Pat Frank, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, Stephen King's The Stand, and The Day of the Triffids by John Wyndham are all great places to start (even if the apocalypse doesn't end up coming anytime soon). You've already read The Hunger Games, right?

, If we're all honest with ourselves, what kind of world could we recreate without others?


For most of us, not much. Can you make a battery from a lemon? Or a potato clock? Lowering the bar... how are you at tying knots?

, Taking car batteries and daisy chaining them will act as an energy storage device, but you're going to need to generate power. A generator running on wood, gas or a diesel engine where you can make your own fuel is good, but the real payoff is using renewable energy by making your own wind turbine out of PVC pipes and a car alternator or scavenging some solar panels near a highway. When the events do take a turn for the worst, at least you'll be able to be productive at night and have some of the luxuries of your former life.


Having electricity in your safe house will keep the lights on and keep electronics running. Electricity is important to run power tools, welders, water/fuel pumps, radio equipment as well as charge any portable item or comfort item you may wish to use. It'll be a surprising source of morale, too.

An attic can be dangerously hot on a summer day, So, take care to stay out of the heat as much as possible while you work on getting out of the attic.,
Look around for the attic entrance, typically a small panel or staircase.,
Look for a light switch to turn on so you can see what you're doing, and so (particularly at night) others may notice your presence by light escaping from the attic.

,
If you have a cell phone or other communication device, call for help.

,
Tap several times on the beams and the roof to attract attention.,
If you are feeling weak or sick you should do something quickly to avoid collapsing and cooking.

,
Look for a spot in the ceiling made of soft material only, such as sheet rock (generally the whole ceiling in a house is made of it) or wood strips and plaster.,
Alternatively, pop out a vent or grill to admit fresh air and attract attention, or escape through it if you must.,
Use a tool to escape if you have it and help is not coming.",How to Survive in and Escape from an Attic,"


Generally, stay low and look for a space fresh air is entering. Often, it enters at the eaves and escapes, hotter, at vents higher up.
Watch where you'd escape to. Don't escape to a long drop to the ground or an interior floor; instead, attract attention and be rescued.;
, Pick up and set aside a loose panel, or swing a door or staircase down.


Until you've tried this, you're just in an attic, not really stuck in an attic.
Some attics may have doors into other rooms, or onto a roof.

,,, Use something hard to do the tapping, preferably. Do this every so often.

,, Shift insulation out of the way if possible and stomp or otherwise strike it to break it. Hold onto something so you don't fall through before checking what is underneath. This will open a hole to the room underneath. See what is down there before dropping through.


If the attic has a wall leading to an interior top-level room or an entrance to the roof, try to break that as well.

,


It may be possible to pop out a nailed-on wooden panel. The ones on the ends of a typical roof are probably easier to hit squarely and less securely attached. Do not strike a surface with nails poking through it. Take care not to throw yourself out after the panel.

, If you have a saw, you could even cut a hole (careful, you don't want to be trapped in an attic injured).

Create a Family Emergency Plan document.,
Make an emergency numbers contact list.,
Sign up for emergency services text messages.,
Talk with your power company about what to expect.,
Get a functional weather radio.",How to Prepare for a Power Outage1," Some power outages are planned well in advance, but others are the result of an emergency situation, such as flood or tornado. Before you lose power, sit down with your family and write down what each family member will do in case of an outage. Give each person specific responsibilities, such as gathering flashlights, and discuss how you all will communicate in case the internet or landlines go down.Give these documents to extended family members and friends as well. This will help them to know where to find you and how to contact you in the event of an emergency.Go through as many different scenarios as possible when creating this document. For example, talk about what you will do if it is unsafe to drive due to downed power lines in your area.
Some organizations, like the Red Cross, have downloadable templates available online that you can use to start the process of creating your own customized plan.;
, Print out a list of all important numbers and place this somewhere safe and easy-to-access, such as in an “emergency” cabinet file. This list should include numbers for the power company, the local fire department, hospital, personal doctor, and other emergency agencies., Go online to the website for your local government disaster agency, like FEMA branches, and see if they offer text or email alerts for power outages or other emergencies. This is a great, free way to give yourself a few extra minutes of preparation time prior to an actual outage.


Also, go ahead and sign up for any notifications offered by your power company. Then you will know if they have any planned outages coming up for your area., Before an outage occurs, call your power company and discuss with them what their protocol is in the event of a residential power loss. Ask them how they will contact you and how they go about determining which areas to service first. This may seem like a hassle, but it will be great information to have in the event of an outage.


Power companies recognize that some people rely on electricity to keep critical medical devices up and running. If this is the case for you, alert your company and they will put you on a priority service list., If your outage is weather-related, then you will want to keep a close eye on developing conditions. Cell service may be unreliable during these situations, so a battery or hand-crank radio is your best option. This may seem an antiquated way of getting information, but it actually works really well in storm situations.Many emergency agencies, such as the Red Cross, sell weather radios online.

Know the units.,
Use a Geiger Counter.,
Use a MicroR meter which has a Sodium Iodide detector.,
Use a Neutron REM meter With a Proportional Counter.,
Use an Ion Chamber.",How to Measure Radiation," No measurement is useful if you don't know what the reading actually means. Followed by the magnitude(the number) is a unit.There are many units which are used to measure radiation for different purposes.


In the United States, radiation absorbed dose, dose equivalent, and exposure are often measured and stated in the older units called rad, rem, or roentgen (R), respectively. Sometimes these units prove to be too large to use practically so subunits like mrad (mili-rad which is one thousand times smaller than rad) and μrad (micro-rad which is a million times smaller than rad) are used.
The SI system of measure is the official system of measurement and defines two units to count radiation: gray (Gy) and sievert (Sv).

The conversion is as follows:

1 Gy = 100 rad
1 mGy = 100 mrad
1 Sv = 100 rem
1 mSv = 100 mrem



;
, A Geiger counter has a Geiger-Mueller (G-M) Tube which is filled with gas which creates an electrical pulse which is converted to a reading and shown on the meter. It may also have a speaker which turns each interaction into audible clicks.The common readout units are roentgens per hour (R/hr), milliroentgens per hour (mR/hr), rem per hour (rem/hr), millirem per hour (mrem/hr), and counts per minute (cpm)and is usually specified in the manual and is sometimes visible on the display.


You may also need a zinc sulfide (ZnS) scintillator probe if you meter doesn't have one built-in. The scintillator probe is sensitive to alpha radiation. A Geiger counter is the most popular radiation measurement tool in the field as it provides a relatively accurate and real-time measurement of the radioactivity in the surrounding area.

, As a crystal of sodium iodide creates a flash of white light when struck by radiation, makes it a useful radiation detector. A sensor converts the flash of light to an electrical signal. This is used as a single channel detector to identify a radioactive substance. MicroR meters also give an audible click when it detects radiation, making it useful to point out the direction of a radioactive substance substance.



Portable Multichannel Analyzers are coupled with a multichannel analyzer package and are becoming much more popular and cheap.These instruments automatically display the type of radiation which is present, making them useful when you don't know which type of radiation is present in the surroundings.

, This device, as the name suggests creates an electrical pulse when a neutron interacts with the apparatus.These counters require a large amount of hydrogenous around them to slow the neutrons down as high speed neutrons will just whiz by without interacting at all.

, An air filled chamber with electrically conductive walls along with a central anode which works at a relatively low voltage. When x-rays or gamma rays interact with the air surrounding the anode, electrons are released which are collected by the anode. The Anode then generates a small current which is measured by the meter and is displayed.The machine gives a reading related to the absorption of radiation by air which needs to be converted to a reading related to absorption by tissue

Grab a long-sleeved shirt and some pants.,
Come up with an escape plan.,
Seek shelter.,
Find a food source.,
Go on the defensive.,
Find other survivors.,
Stay positive.",How to Survive an Apocalypse2," If you were out lounging on your pool deck with nothing but earbuds on and iPhone in hand (how else would you be reading this?), you're going to want to put on some layers. Even if the meteor looming on the horizon will send a blast of heat from here to Fargo, you'll be glad you did.


Pretty much any cause for an apocalypse requires long, comfortable clothing.You want a long-sleeved shirt and pants to protect your skin from predators, yes, but also from the sun and treacherous terrain. The apocalypse is no time to work on your tan.
If you have time, grab a pair of boots. If you don't have boots nearby, go for tennis shoes. You may have to break into a dead sprint at any time. If you have the luxury, make sure you're comfortable enough in your clothes and shoes to flee.

, If for some odd reason your house isn't safe to stay in, you'll need to get out as soon as possible. With your map in hand, get out and get out now. Would you do best in the forest? Near water? Are you concerned with privacy and hiding from others or is there not another soul in sight? Your specific situation will determine where you should go.


Again, if you can stay in your house, do so. A shelter is best and friends and family will know how to find you. Make an assessment of your situation. Be as logical and rational as possible. You may want to stay, but is it best for you and your family?

, Even if it's not nuclear, you'll be better off escaping the perils of weather and being exposed to predators by getting and staying inside. But if it's a blast that is putting down the human race, it's doubly imperative that you shield yourself from the radiation as quickly as you can.


Basements are a good place to start. 16 inches (40.6 cm) of solid brick can keep radiation away from you, so you should fairly set there -- not to mention among your own things. One inch (2.5cm) of steel will do it too, but you probably don't live on the Enterprise., You'll probably want this to be from a remnant of your soon-to-be past and not a raspberry bush or particularly lively pond. A grocery store or even recently-deserted houses are your best bet. As you're scrounging, get a candy bar and chow it down. The last thing you want to think about right now is hunger.


And stock up. Don't think in terms of days; think in weeks. Grab a few bags and start scrumping. What can you carry that'll last the longest? Think in volume and weight in addition to preservation. Cans are good, but they're heavy. But if everything is already picked over, don't get fussy; take what you can get.
Water. Get loads and loads and loads of water. Or else you'll be drinking your pee in no time.

, It's safe to assume at this juncture that whatever is out there is not your friend. Find a weapon that you can actually use and start watching your six. When it comes to humans, there is no place for intelligence and culture now -- you do what you need to do.


Don't flash your gun like you do your BMW. Conceal your weapons.You know that scene in Die Hard where Bruce had those guns taped to his back (despite the fact that tape doesn't adhere easily to pools of sweat) and pulled a one-over on that German villain either played by Jeremy Irons or Alan Rickman? That's going to be you. No one's going to pull the wool over your eyes. You're a weapon yourself.

, You've got your food, you've got your weapons, and you've staked out a place to stay. Now it's time to assemble a team a la The Walking Dead. Except that you want a team that is actually useful. When you consider taking on others (they're mouths to feed, after all), assess what they can do for you. Do they know plants? Are they a wizard with a javelin? Are they carrying their own stockpile of food?


Okay, you'll probably want friends so you shouldn't be too picky. If you're not going to assess them for their goods, at least consider their character. Does your gut tell you they're trustworthy?
If you're all alone, keep a look out for lights and fires at nighttime. If you see one or more, consider venturing out yourself to make new best friends, but only if you think the end would justify the means. How far away is the light? How quickly could you get there? What would you be risking by leaving? Are there predators or obstacles in your path? You may be better off being alone, for now.

, This will arguably be the hardest thing, especially if you're alone or wounded. But ultimately this hardship will be easier to handle if you remain optimistic about it. And if there are children with you, all the more reason.


Do not let your ethics stand in the way of your identity. The rules are different now. Just because you decided someone isn't pulling their slack and the team should, therefore, cut their losses doesn't mean you've turned into an animal. Assess your moralities as you see fit, but understand that the world is a much different place now and you must adapt to it to stay alive and fruitful.

Charge your cell phone.,
Disconnect all surge-prone devices.,
Purchase extra batteries or chargers.,
Store electronic information on a flash drive or the Cloud.,
Purchase and learn to operate a home generator.,
Know how to manually release your garage door.",How to Prepare for a Power Outage2," Do your best to keep your phone fully charged before an outage strikes. Try to maintain a full battery by shutting off any unused apps and minimizing the brightness of your screen. Shifting your phone into airplane mode will also help to keep the battery full.When your phone is charged, keep your phone calls short to further conserve the battery and not tie up networks., Before a storm hits, go through your house and turn off all electronic items that could suffer from a power surge. Even with surge protectors, laptops, TVs, and certain appliances, such as stand-alone microwaves, could be damaged if not unplugged., For small electronics that you would like to use during an outage, such as a cell phone, include extra charging devices in your emergency kit. A car charger, for example, can help keep your cell phone powered up. Additional batteries can help keep your flashlights going.If you use a wheelchair or other assistance device, talk to the manufacturer about what non-electric charging options are available., In the event that the power is out for an extended period, there may be some important documents, like insurance coverage materials, that you need to access. Keeping copies of these items on a portable drive or Cloud location makes it possible to access them anywhere.These extra copies can also keep your information safe in the event that a power surge does damage your laptop or other devices.

, Choosing a generator can be a tricky process. It is often best to consult with an electrician who can instruct you regarding how to buy, install, and work your generator. Some generators tie directly into the home power source, whereas others are portable, but provide less overall power. Operating a generator safely is extremely important, as they can put off toxic fumes if not properly ventilated or installed.If you plan to use a generator, go ahead and install carbon monoxide alarms in all rooms and gathering spaces of your home., Many doors operate with electricity and you may want to drive your car even while your power is still off. First you’ll need to locate your door’s release lever. It may look like a plastic handle attached at the end of a rope towards the back of your garage or a metal slide-lever to the side of the doors. Practice lifting this release lever to manually raise your garage door without using electricity.If there are downed power lines in the street, it is generally not safe to drive and it may be better to keep your car in the garage protected.

Customize this kit as needed by including items for specific individuals, such as diapers for any infants.After any emergency situation, make sure to go back and re-stock any items that you used. Also, reassess the items that you’ve included to determine if they were worthwhile or could be replaced.Various disaster preparation agencies, such as FEMA, have lengthy kit packing lists that you can modify to suit your purposes and needs.
Don’t forget to include any pet items, such as cat food, in your kit as well.

, This will give you peace of mind and will help you treat any minor injuries sustained during an outage. Include the following items, at minimum: latex gloves, dressings and bandages, tweezers, scissors, antibiotic and burn ointment, saline solution, thermometer, pain relief medication, anti-diarrhea medications, and extra prescription medications.Go through this kit on a monthly basis and discard any medications that have expired.

, Avoid being in the dark and hungry by fully stocking your fridge in advance and knowing how long the food inside will stay edible. Refrigerators will generally keep their contents cool for up to four hours and a freezer will keep food safe to consume for up to 48 hours if fully stocked, 24 hours if only half-full.Filling your freezer up with ice is a great way to keep the temp down and preserve food longer. Either purchase ice bags or store plastic water-filled containers until they freeze.
As you take food out, test the temperatures with a digital thermometer to ensure food safety before eating., Many gas stations now use electricity to power their pumps, so they will be out-of-commission in the event of a broad power outage. Prepare in advance for this by keeping your car tank at least half-full. Storing containers of gasoline in a safe spot in your garage is another way to keep your car running.Just make sure to never run your car indoors or in any closed area or you risk carbon monoxide poisoning.

, In periods of intense heat or cold, losing power may mean that you need to leave your home and seek shelter elsewhere. If you think this situation might apply to your family, contact local emergency officials to see where shelters would be located in the event of an outage. Also, add weather preparation materials, such as extra blankets, into your home emergency kit., Passing the time without electronic devices might seem difficult at first, but there are actually many ways to stay entertained. Keep a supply of card and board games handy. Pull out a jigsaw puzzle or two. Go through and read those books that you’ve been meaning to catch up on."

Remain calm and do not panic!,
If it is dark, find a light source.,
Don't escape through the hatches in the ceiling.,
Close out any negative thoughts and think positive.,
Press each of the floor buttons one by one.,
Look through the gap between the doors of the lift.,
Check the time.,
Call for help using either an emergency or alarm button located on the elevator's button panel or an emergency phone which should be built into the elevator, usually concealed behind a door under the button panel.,
Before the building shuts down, see if your phone has any reception or internet.",How to Survive Being Stuck in a Lift," You may have heard this a lot of times and it is true that panicking will do you no good. It will cause you to not be able to think clearly and will not make your situation better. Remain calm and remember that this is reality and not a film, and a modern lift is not likely to come crashing down, even if the cables snap.;
, Modern phones can usually be used to for this purpose.

, Luckily modern lifts don't have hatches in the ceiling. Escaping this way would be extremely dangerous.

, Remember that you are still alive, and don't believe it when your mind tells you that the walls are closing in. They are not closing in, they will not close in, and you can still breathe. Just keep it in mind that elevators usually have cameras, so don't do anything which looks stupid and you will regret (imagine what people would think when they view the tape).

, Then, try the ""doors open"" button. If none of the buttons works, the lift is broken, and you need to let someone know about it.

,


If you can see light between the doors, the lift has stopped near a floor, and you should be able to shout for help and be released, as the doors can be opened with a key. Do not try to force the doors open yourself. If the lift starts working again when you are partway out, you could be in for a nasty surprise.
If you can't see light between the doors, the lift has stopped between floors, and no one will be able to let you out if you scream for help. Look for an emergency telephone. If there is no telephone, there should be an alarm button. Press this repeatedly. Eventually, someone should hear you and get help.
If it seems like no one can hear you, don't give up hope! Keep pressing the button, and know that you will be rescued.

, If you have waited for more than half an hour and nobody has come to get you out shout and bang the inside walls of the lift; take off your shoe and bang with that. If there are still people in the building, you must get their help before they leave for the night.


If everyone has left the building, and no one is responding to you, then you'll have to accept that you will be in the lift overnight. If this happens, stop shouting and banging - you don't want to develop sleep deprivation. You are probably tired by now. Make yourself as comfortable as possible, and get some sleep to save your energy. By morning, the building should be full again, and you can try to get some help then.

, It is law in most countries for elevators to have an emergency phone. If none of these options are available, try the next step.

,


If you do have reception, call emergency services. Explain your situation and ask for help. Tell them the address of the building you are in and between which floors you are stuck.
If you have WiFi connection contact a family member or friend. You can go on Facebook and ask a friend that you know will believe you. Tell them that you are in an elevator that has stopped working and ask them to contact emergency services and explain your situation to the police or fire department. Don't forget to tell them what the address is of the building and possibly which elevator you are stuck in. Now, just wait patiently.

Never quit!,
Find shelter.,
Realistically assess your situation.,
Gather your resources.,
Know your ""enemy"".,
Know when to keep moving and when to stay put.,
Make a plan and stick with it.",How to Survive a Living Hell," In order to have any chance at all of surviving to ""tell the tale,"" you must understand that your attitude is the single most important ally that you are likely to have. Above all, your will to live and to ""beat the odds"" will sustain you even when your situation seems utterly hopeless. This basic principle holds true for every situation in which a person is forced to live in a dangerous or outright hostile environment. It doesn't matter if you're in a combat zone, lost in the jungle, or if you've crashed your plane into the side of a mountain or find yourself in an abusive relationship, sheer determination is what separates the survivors from the ""statistics"".;
, A warm, dry place not only keeps you out of the elements and gives you a somewhat secure place in which to plan your next move, but also provides many psychological benefits.

, It is imperative that you remain calm and think! If you let panic overrule common sense and critical thinking, then you set yourself up for a series of mistakes in a situation that leaves little room for error.

, Take stock of yourself and your surroundings. Surviving for a long period of time in adverse conditions means conserving your resources and knowing where and how to gather more. Resources can also include allies (anyone available to you who is trustworthy and willing to help). Don't isolate yourself, accept assistance from allies if it is available. This applies especially if the ""enemy"" is a human or large animal.

, In most survival scenarios the elements (i.e. heat, cold, predators, terrain, etc.), along with hunger and thirst are the antagonists. In other cases, such as combat or an abusive relationship, the ""enemy"" is an actual person or group. In all cases you must learn as much as you can about what or whom you are dealing with.

, This is the tricky part because of the danger inherent in both of these courses of action. If you are relatively sure that someone at least has some idea of where you are then you might want to stay put so you will be easier to find. If you are unsure, then your best course of action might be to strike out on your own and move toward a location that will offer you the best chance of being rescued. You can literally ""what if"" yourself to death about this so trust your instincts and make a decision. Right or wrong, at least you will be doing something to save your own life.

, There are many ways to do this. One way is to come up with three workable plans incorporating the information and resources gathered in steps three through six and then work through a list of pros and cons for each plan. Pick the most feasible of the three and file the other two away as back-up plans. However, it is vitally important that you remember to remain flexible! No matter how good your plan is, it is likely that you will have to adjust to unforeseen circumstances.

If you have friends or family in the area, choose a location that will make it easy for them to visit you.
If you're moving to a new city and don't know anyone, choose an area close to the places you plan on frequenting the most. This may be your job, your school, downtown restaurants, or local parks, depending on your preferences.
Make sure you look into the safety of your new neighborhood. You can investigate by asking locals, looking at local crime maps, and touring the area yourself.;
, Try not to get scared living on your own. There will probably be lots of little things that you will have to learn how to deal with that will be brand-new to you, but try not to get overwhelmed.


When you're on your own, you won't have anyone else to take care of everyday things for you, so you'll need to learn to face your fears. If you're afraid of bugs, try standing up to the next spider you see instead of running away. If you're convinced you'll burn the house down if you try to cook your own meal, start small and learn how to make a simple dish.
Make sure you have proper security at your house or apartment, including outdoor lights, good locks on your doors, and maybe even an alarm system.

, Living alone can be great, and there are lots of things you can do to live alone happily. Take some simple steps like personalizing your space, inviting friends over frequently, and creating a schedule for cleaning and maintaining your home to make living alone more fun and less stressful.


One of the great things about living alone is that you get to make your own rules. If you want to have a giant beanbag chair or a hammock in your living room instead of a couch, there's no one to tell you you can't.

, Living alone doesn't mean you need to be alone all the time. Staying social can make living alone much more enjoyable.Stay in touch with old friends. Even if you're far away from them, talking to someone you've known for a long time can make you feel so much better when you're feeling lonely.
Introduce yourself to your neighbors. Being friendly with your neighbors will come in super handy if you ever need some help with something.
Socialize with coworkers or classmates if you can.
Join clubs or connect with people on social websites like meetup.com.
Try volunteering for a cause you're passionate about to stay busy and meet like-minded people., When you live alone, you have to learn how to manage your finances and plan for the future.


Make sure that you get a house or apartment that you can really afford. Spending all of your income on an apartment will leave you with no money to have fun, which can make living alone much harder, so don't go over-budget.
Budget for the essentials like food, gas, healthcare, insurance, and utilities. When it comes to non-essentials, carefully consider how much you can afford to spend each month.
Try to put some money away in an emergency fund and in a retirement savings account.

, In addition to inviting friends over to your home and getting out regularly, you will also need to learn how to be comfortable spending time alone at your new place. If you're accustomed to living with friends, a partner, or your parents, this might be a bit of an adjustment, but if you commit yourself to being independent, you'll learn how to combat your loneliness.Try to develop hobbies that you can do yourself. You can try anything from working on crossword puzzles to knitting sweaters to watching exercise videos. You're likely to feel more lonely when you're bored, so any enjoyable activity that can be done alone at your home will help keep these feelings at bay.
If you're really feeling lonely, you might want to consider getting a pet. You will not only have a companion, but you'll also be busy taking care of your new animal, so you won't get as bored. If you rent your home, make sure to check with your landlord before getting a pet.
Pay attention to the kinds of situations that typically make you feel lonely and try to make a change. For example, if you tend to feel lonely when you come home from work and watch television until bedtime, fill those hours with a more stimulating activity. If you get lonely because you used to cook elaborate meals for your family and now that you live alone you're eating TV dinners, learn how to cook for one.

, Many people are intimidated by the thought of going out to the movie theater or to a restaurant alone because they think that other people will judge them. The truth is that no one is likely to even notice that you are alone, and you'll still have a great time, so don't worry about going places alone!If you're having trouble getting over your fear, try starting small and working your way up to bigger feats. For example, if you really want to be able to go out to a nice restaurant alone, start by going out for coffee alone, then going to a casual restaurant alone, and finally going to a nicer restaurant.
There are so many things you can do by yourself and still have a great time. Think about seeing a movie or a play, going to a sports game, getting a drink at a local bar, going ice skating, visiting the zoo, going to a gallery, or playing some games at an arcade. There is no reason why you can't enjoy any of these activities solo., Sometimes you might just want some quality time by yourself when you're out, but other times you might really be looking for an opportunity to socialize.


If you want to be alone at a place like a restaurant or coffee shop, you might feel more comfortable having something to do. Consider reading a newspaper or doing a crossword puzzle while you wait for your food.
If you want to meet people, put all distractions, especially your phone, away. Being on your phone will make you appear less approachable to others. Make small talk with people and don't be shy about asking a group of people if you can join them., No matter where you are and what you are doing, be safe and use extra caution when you're alone.This means always being aware of your surroundings and avoiding places that seem unsafe.


Depending on where you are going, you may want to bring a small can of mace with you.
If you're walking to your car by yourself, it is wise to hold your keys in your hands so you will not be distracted by looking for them. You can also use your key as a weapon if necessary.
Be careful about drinking too much and always make sure you have a safe way to get home.

, Once you've mastered the art of going out for an evening by yourself, you might consider going on a trip alone. This will allow you to plan a trip that is perfect for you without having to worry about anyone else's preferences.When you travel alone, you are in control of every aspect of your trip, from where you stay to how long you spend roaming the city each day. Take advantage of the opportunity to plan your dream trip.
Use your social skills to meet people. If you know how to meet people at home, you can meet people while on a trip as well. Use the same cautions as you would at home when meeting new people, and have a great time!

, Getting stressed out will reduce your chances of surviving because you won't be thinking clearly. Take a deep breath and try to think about the situation logically. Try making a list of things you need to do in order of importance. Thinking about survival as a series of manageable tasks can help you stay focused and avoid panicking.Try not to dwell on all of the bad things that could happen. Instead, focus on the proactive steps you will take to prevent bad things from happening.
Resist the urge to feel sorry for yourself or doubt your abilities. Keep reminding yourself that you're up to the challenge and will survive.
Keep yourself motivated by making plans for what you will do when you make it back home.Resilience is just as important as calmness, so never give up!

, If you take some time to properly prepare yourself before any potentially dangerous outing, you will greatly increase your chances of surviving.


Make sure you understand the environment you're in and the particular threats it poses. Surviving in the desert will require a different technique than surviving in the mountains or in the woods.
Think about wildlife that might pose a threat. If bears are a concern, be sure to store your food away from your sleeping area. If snakes are a concern, be extra careful about watching where you step.
Bring the proper supplies, including food and water, appropriate clothing, water purification tablets, a knife and/or hatchet, a fire starter, a first-aid kit, a map of the area, and a compass.
If you plan on being out in the wilderness, consider taking a class to strengthen your survival skills.
Before going out on any kind of adventure, always let at least one person know where you will be going and how long you plan on being out. Make sure this person knows to call for help if he or she can't get in in touch with you., Your main concerns should be getting adequate food and water, protecting yourself from the elements, and preventing illness and injury.



Make a shelter appropriate for your location. Try to keep the climate in mind when choosing the materials to use. If the area is very hot, you will want to make sure your shelter protects you from the sun, but allows a breeze to come in. If the area is very cold, you will want to prevent as much wind penetration as possible.Building a fire will provide warmth, allow you to cook your food, keep predators away, and help you signal for help.If you don't already have one, try making a weapon like a spear to protect you against predators and hunt for food.Find clean water. Staying hydrated is essential, but it's also important to think about the safety of the water you are drinking. Boil or otherwise purify your water to avoid illness.
Forage or hunt for food. Depending on your location you may be able to forage for fruits and nuts, hunt small animals, or fish. Be very cautious about eating any plants or insects that you do not recognize, as they may be poisonous. Always cook your food if possible.
Treat any injuries right away. If you are bleeding, apply pressure to stop it. If you break a bone, you may have to create a splint using sticks and a piece of fabric. Always use antiseptic ointment for open wounds if you have it., Use whatever means you can think of to let other people know where you are and that you need help.If you have a cell phone but do not have good enough reception to make a phone call, try sending a text instead.
Use an emergency radio or flares if you have them.
Use clothing or other items to spell out a message that can be read from above, such as SOS.
Reflect the sun using a mirror or other shiny object to increase your visibility.
Build a signal fire. Try to burn materials that create a lot of smoke, like evergreen boughs, in the daytime to keep your signal visible. The universal signal for help is three columns of smoke.
If you're lost, stay put so someone can find you. If you attempt to find your way out on your own, you may just get lost further in the wilderness."
"
Remain calm.,
Alert others.,
Know the plan.,
Prepare to run.",How to Survive a Public Shooting1," It's natural to panic in an emergency like a public shooting, but panicking causes people to react emotionally rather than thoughtfully.It may seem impossible to keep calm during an emergency, but there are a few things you can do to remain level-headed.


Focus on your breath. Count to three while breathing in, hold your breath to the count of three, then exhale to the count of three.You can (and should) do this while moving to safety, but controlling your breath can help you from hyperventilating or making rash decisions.;
, Once you realize that there is an active shooter situation, you should alert others nearby. Some people may not have noticed that an incident has been unfolding, while others may be frozen with fear. Announce to everyone else around you that you believe there is an active shooter situation, and that everyone needs to get out or hide., It's imperative that you have a plan in place of what to do in case of an emergency. Training and preparation can help you escape to safety, but remember to always have a backup plan. If you can't follow your primary plan, evaluate whether or not you can follow your backup plan., Many people freeze up in an emergency. If a shooter is active, you may feel the urge to remain still and hide. However, experts advise that hiding should only be an option if you cannot safely escape.If you know of an escape route that will keep you at a safe distance from the shooter, resist the urge to freeze up and force yourself to run, as long as you can do so safely.

"
"
Visualize your movements.,
Get out if you can.,
Leave your stuff.,
Use any exit you can.,
Call emergency services.",How to Survive a Public Shooting2," It's important to plan your escape route, and be aware of your surroundings. If there are possible positions along the route where the shooter could potentially ambush you or others, recognize this, and anticipate how you would respond if that were to happen.Most shooters aim at arbitrary targets. The harder you are to see and hit, the safer you will be, so try to be rational and avoid entering into the shooter's line of sight.If you're in the vicinity of the shooter, try to find an escape route that gives you both concealment (to stay out of view of the shooter) and cover (to protect you from bullets)., When an active shooter is in your vicinity, even though you're afraid, it's important to keep moving and to get as far away from the situation and the shooter as possible. Don't stick around to watch or figure out what is going on, but put as much distance between you and the shooter; this will make it difficult for the shooter to shoot you and reduces the chance that you'll be shot by random fire.Note that this is only possible if the shooter has not noticed you, if you're lost in a crowd, or if you hear gunshots from a distance but have not yet seen the shooter.
If you can help others without endangering yourself, try to do so.Try to escape even if others insist on staying. Encourage the other people you pass to leave with you.However, if others are uncertain about running, don't wait for them to decide. It's important that you get out first and foremost., Remember that your life is what's important, not your phone or other belongings. Don't delay your escape trying to grab material items, and if you see anyone else trying to gather their things, tell them to leave their material possessions behind., Take any exit you can to escape, including emergency exits and emergency windows. Most restaurants, movie theaters, and other public places have doors and exits designated for staff (in stockrooms and kitchens, for example), so look for and use these if possible., Once you are removed from the situation and have made a safe exit, call 911 or find someone with a phone to make the call.Stay as far away from the building as possible once you're outside.
Prevent passersby and others from entering the situation. Alert people outside the building of what is happening inside, and advise them to also stay as far away as possible.

"
"
Find a hiding spot.,
Keep quiet.,
Block the hiding spot.,
Stay low and horizontal.",How to Survive a Public Shooting3," Choose a spot that is out of the shooter's visual field and that can provide protection if shots are fired your way. Ideally, your hiding place should not trap you and make you a ""sitting duck."" An ideal hiding place should have adequate space for you to move and escape if you need to.Be quick in deciding where to hide. Try to secure a place to hide as soon as you can.
If you can't find a room with a door that can lock to hide in, try to hide behind something that can conceal your body, like a photocopier or filing cabinet.

, Turn off the lights if there are lights, and be silent. Be sure to turn off both your phone's ringer and its ability to vibrate.Resist the urge to cough or sneeze, and do not try to talk to anyone else who may be hiding near you.


Remember that if you're hiding, the last thing you want to do is have the shooter notice you.Don't call the authorities, even though you may be tempted. If you're in a populated place, like a restaurant or school, chances are that some people escaped or heard the gunfire and will alert law enforcement.

, If you are in a room, lock the door, or block it with something heavy, like a filing cabinet or sofa. Make it as difficult as possible for the shooter to enter the room.Making it difficult for the shooter to get into a room keeps you safe and also buys you time. If you or someone else has called the police, they should respond in a matter of minutes. Even just two to three minutes is a significant amount of time in an emergency situation., Lie on the floor, face down with your arms near but not covering your head. This facedown position protects your internal organs. In addition, if the shooter comes across you in this position, he may assume you're already dead. Laying low to the ground also reduces your chance of being shot by a stray bullet.Keep away from the door. Some shooters will just shoot through a locked door, rather than try to enter it or break it down. Since bullets can go through doors, it's best to stay away from that area."
"
Fight as a last resort.,
Find items to use as weapons.,
Incapacitate the shooter.,
Be physically aggressive.,
Stay committed.",How to Survive a Public Shooting4," Do not try to fight the shooter if you can safely escape or hide from the assailant.Fighting should be a last resort, but if you must fight, it's important to go into full survival mode., Locate anything you can use to hit or harm the shooter, such as a chair or fire extinguisher or pot of hot coffee. Most people won't have armed weapons on hand, so you'll need to improvise and use what you've got around you.You could hold the object in front of your body to deflect the shots or throw it at the shooter.


Scissors or letter openers can be used as a knife. Even a pen could be used as a weapon, particularly since you give it leverage with the back of your thumb.If there is a fire extinguisher nearby, grab it. You can spray the fire extinguisher in the shooter's face, or use the object itself to bash the shooter in the head., Fighting back against the shooter is always a last resort if your life is endangered. If you cannot escape or hide, work alone or with others to fight. Try to find a way to get the gun out of his hands or to knock him down to disorient him.Encourage others to try and help you. Working as a group will give you an advantage over the solitary shooter., If the shooter is very close, you could try to disarm him, again, only if your life is absolutely in danger. Whatever you do, it's important that you act fast and focus on disarming or incapacitating the shooter.If the shooter has a rifle, grab the barrel and turn it away from you while striking or kicking him at the same time. The shooter will likely try to get control of the weapon back, but if you follow his movement he may be caught off guard and get thrown off balance. If you can get the butt end of the rifle as well, then you'll have both ends and can use the weapon as leverage to further kick, knee, or push the assailant.If the shooter has a pistol, try to grab it by the barrel from the top, so that he cannot point it at you. With many models, grabbing the pistol from the top keeps the shot from being fired.
Try to aim high when attempting to bring down the shooter. His hands and the weapon are the most dangerous parts of him during a shooting. Otherwise, try for the eyes, face, shoulder and neck., Even though you may be scared, particularly if you're armed with a broom and you know the shooter has an assault rifle, stay focused on getting that rifle out of his hands and bringing him down. Think of your life and the lives of others he may go after.


Fortunately, your body's natural ""fight"" response should be triggered and keep you alert and focused on staying alive, whatever the costs."
"
Remain calm.,
Keep your hands visible at all times.,
Avoid pointing or yelling.,
Know that help for the injured is coming.",How to Survive a Public Shooting5," If you've escaped the situation, try to breath deeply. Chances are that you may be experiencing feelings of panic or shock or numbness due to the trauma, so it's best to try to get your bearings by centering your focus on your breathing.When you feel able to talk, you should call your family and loved ones to let them know that you're alright.

, Law enforcement's first task is to stop the shooter, so as you emerge from the building or public place, always keep your hands up to show that you are not carrying any weapons. Police are trained to initially treat everyone as a suspect since some shooters pretend to impersonate victims., The police have specific guidelines on how to proceed during a public shooting. Let them do their jobs and don't confuse or aggravate the situation by intervening, particularly since your emotions are likely heightened. Let them do their jobs effectively and take down the shooter., The police are trained to locate and stop shooters and this is their primary goal. They will not stop and tend to the injured, but you needn't worry as paramedics have likely already been called to care for those shot or otherwise hurt during the incident.If you have been shot, try to slow your breathing which can help prevent shock and slow the bleeding. Cover the wound with your hands or a cloth and apply pressure to try to stop the bleeding until you can get medical aid.

A set of clothes. You want to pack light layers so that you can be dressed appropriately for all weather. Instead of packing a bunch of heavy clothes (sweaters, parkas, etc), try to pack light layers like a tank top, short sleeve, and long-sleeve t-shirt.
Food and food preparation. It is suggested to have at least three days of prepared food packed and ready to go in a portable bug out bag.This may include MRE (Meals Ready to Eat) or other non-perishable food items like protein bars, peanut butter, or canned vegetables.You may also want to include simple cooking preparation gear such as a collapsible pot and a utility utensil set.
Water. Include a collapsible water canteen, water filter, and at least three days worth of water. This should be about 3 liters (0.8 US gal).Also include a water filter; modern water filters even come in the form of a survival straw.
Portable shelter. This could be a simple sleeping bag, a bed roll, or a blanket. A tent may be more effective, but may be too heavy or large for a portable bag.
First aid and/or medical kit. Pack medications that you know you will need for a pre-existing medical condition.Pack other essentials like bandages, antiseptics, and gauze.;
, These tablets help stop the thyroid from absorbing radiation. This will be useful in the event of nuclear fallout., Your bug out bag should be packed with mobility in mind. Prepare to have to carry and walk for a long period of time. While it is best to be prepared for what happens, it is also essential that you are able to carry your bag.

Learn how to stop panic attacks.,
Control your breathing.,
Learn how to redirect emotions.,
Learn how to condition your brain to take control of your survival.",How to Survive a Doomsday Event2," Panic attacks occur when your brain is overcome with signals from bodily systems, such as the adrenal gland. These attacks are characterized by physical distress such as shortness of breath, fear, and vertigo. They can be brought on by stressful situations or a psychological trigger from a past event.To avoid panic attacks, try to stay away from smoking or caffeine. (You may be forced to do this in a doomsday scenario in any case.)
Work on controlling your breathing and focusing on taking control of your body.
Understand what triggers your panic attacks and try to acknowledge the stress. If you think through what makes you panic, you can work to mentally overcome or avoid the trigger.

, Studies have shown that you can reduce stress by practicing deep breathing techniques.To practice these techniques you must be in tune with your body.


Try to practice deep breathing by focusing on deep breaths through your nose and out through your mouth. Try and relax further with each breath and develop a consistent breathing routine.
Yoga is also a helpful way to practice healthy breathing techniques. There are many helpful tutorials online to teach you basic yoga techniques. Some basic poses that can help your breathing techniques include warrior pose and sun salutation., Transference, or re-directing your emotions, is the conscious act of cognitively switching off or moving past strong emotion. This takes time and practice and may not be an easy skill to develop.Learn to recognize your emotions first. This may seem difficult. Practice by writing down the strong emotions you feel and what is happening in your environment. This journal will help you to associate situations with emotions.
Then, try to mentally stimulate another emotion. For example, if you know something triggers panic in you, try to embody a sense of calmness. Practicing this will help you do this automatically, although it may be difficult.

, You never want to “space out” during a doomsday event. However, learning to disconnect from your emotions and your racing thoughts just might save your life.


Learning emotional transference will help your brain more efficiently handle emotions. When you are put in a life-or-death situation, your brain is trying to save your life. Emotions and panic may hinder response time. Learning to let go of strong emotions may help your brain better protect your body.

Go underground.,
Stay hidden.,
Protect yourself from the elements.",How to Survive a Doomsday Event3," If you are worried about the fall of civilization or a bombing, your best bet might be to seek shelter underground.This might be a bunker, bomb shelter, or underground shelter. There are many companies that specialize in custom designing and producing these types of shelters.

, History has shown that people panic during doomsday-like events like terrorist attacks or bombings.If you want to keep yourself and your family safe, you may want to consider hiding and staying as remote as possible. This type of surviving is often described as “living off the grid,” and is total isolation from society.

, If you have to escape familiar surroundings, it is important to know how to find shelter from the elements. This includes:


Knowing your local geography in case you have to camp out. Learn about dangerous elements such as land formations and wild animals.
Knowing how to make a quick shelter.Depending on your surroundings, you can use nature around you to build a sufficient shelter like a lean-to, that will help protect your body from the elements.

You should make sure it is in optimal shape, especially if preparing for a doomsday event.Eat healthy foods, such as vegetables, fruits, and proteins to keep your body healthy. You should also exercise to tone your muscles to prepare for long walks or running.

, Keeping your body healthy by exercising is recommended by the Center for Disease Control.You might have to flee quickly or walk long distances. To best prepare you body for this, you should condition it by doing cardio workouts.


Cardio workouts help maximize your body’s blood flow. There are many types of cardio workouts, examples include running, jogging, and rowing.

, One way to stay healthy consistently is to stay current on your health. This includes keeping up-to-date doctors visits, including dentists, optometrists, and general health.

, You never what situation you may find yourself in so it is important to know how to defend yourself from physical threats.Find a local workshop in your area to learn self defense. Sometimes, local police departments will hold courses.
Watch videos online - there are numerous videos that will walk you through basic self defense and training.

Learn to be self-sufficient.,
Grow your own food.,
Learn how to live “off the grid.”While you can, prepare your home for off-the-grid living.,
Learn what plants are edible.,
Learn essential, but often over-looked, home building skills.",How to Survive a Doomsday Event5," You can “homestead” now, which is living as self-sufficiently as possible.This will help you in a survival situation as you will rely less on outside resources.


Homesteading includes raising your own food, like vegetables and animals.
It includes learning to use renewable energy resources, like solar, wind, geothermal, and water.

, Learn how to cultivate your own food from seed so that you are able to grow your own sustenance for long-term survival.


This includes have a store of heirloom seeds.These are non-genetically modified seeds that can be grown and reproduced without modifying them.
Learn to cultivate what grows best in your agricultural zone. For example, corn does not grow best in rocky soil. Learn your soil and climate conditions. Government websites (like the USDA) often have a website dedicated to showing local plant hardiness., This includes:


Power generation -- this can be retrofitted into your original home’s architecture with things like solar panels, generators, wind power, or geothermal power.
Heat generation -- this can be done through a wood burning stove or passive solar gain.
Food generation -- this can be accomplished through raising backyard chickens or having a backyard garden.
Water collection -- water can be collected through rain barrels or a well.
Waste collection -- this can be fixed through a septic system or compost toilets.

, Learning your local ecology can be a huge benefit to surviving. Nature produces many wild-growing medicines and foods in the forms of plants. Learn which plants in your area are good for food and medicine., Ultimately, you are responsible for your own survival. Learn skills that will help make life bearable like basic sewing, cooking, and medical attention.

Use the newspapers.,
Rummage through your camping or outdoor activity supplies.,
Use the barbecue for cooking.,
Put candles to work to make a solid fuel source.,
Make a solar oven for cooking using the power of the sun.,
Burn wood.,
Make fire starters.",How to Make Fuel for Home Survival," If you're an avid newspaper reader, possibly you'll have a good stock of these somewhere in the house. They are excellent for using in a pinch as fuel. The best method is to turn them into logs. See How to make newspaper logs for more details. These can be burned in a fireplace, barbecue, or cut down steel drum, etc.;
, If you're a keen camper for sport or fun, you might have a ready supply of fuels at hand in your gear. Consider using your fuel and camping stove for heating water and cooking hot meals. Avoid using camping stoves for heating as it'll soon run out and do not use them indoors or in enclosed areas; be sure to use with plenty of ventilation.

, If you have a gas or charcoal barbecue, use it for cooking. Again, it's not a good idea to use it for heating as you should ration the heating ability for cooked food and do not use barbecues indoors or in confined spaces.

, If you have plenty of candles in storage, try this method for turning them into fuel sources:


Cut stripes of corrugated cardboard into a width of about 2cm/ 1.5"".
Roll this strip around tightly and squeeze it into a small round can such as those used for fish or small condiments.
Melt the (paraffin wax) candles and pour the melted wax over the rolled up cardboard. Make sure it soaks through and fills any gaps.
Burn when needed. This can be used for cooking, light, and minor heat. It'll last around 1.5 to 2 hours.

, See How to make and use a solar oven for more details.

, If you have cords of wood, use them for making fires in suitable places such as a fireplace, a barbecue, a drum or a fire pit in the backyard, etc.

, If you have some melted wax left over from the previous step, pour it into the hollows of an egg carton. Tear each cube of the carton apart to have ready-to-use fire starters.

Allow people to drink according to their needs.,
Turn off the main water valves.,
Know which water sources are safe and which are not.,
Drink water that you know is not contaminated first.

,
Treat all water of uncertain quality before using it for drinking, food washing or preparation, washing dishes, brushing teeth, or making ice.",How to Manage Food and Water While Taking Shelter in Emergencies1," Many people need even more than the average of one-half gallon, per day. The individual amount needed depends on age, physical activity, physical condition, and time of year. Never ration water unless ordered to do so by authorities. Drink the amount you need today and try to find more for tomorrow. Under no circumstances should a person drink less than one quart (four cups) of water each day. You can minimize the amount of water your body needs by reducing activity and staying cool.;
, You will need to protect the water sources already in your home from contamination if you hear reports of broken water or sewage lines, or if local officials advise you of a problem. To close the incoming water source, locate the incoming valve and turn it to the closed position. Be sure you and other family members know how to perform this important procedure.


To use the water in your pipes, let air into the plumbing by turning on the faucet in your home at the highest level. A small amount of water will trickle out. Then obtain water from the lowest faucet in the home.
To use the water in your hot-water tank, be sure the electricity or gas is off, and open the drain at the bottom of the tank. Start the water flowing by turning off the water intake valve at the tank and turning on the hot-water faucet. Refill the tank before turning the gas or electricity back on. If the gas is turned off, a professional will be needed to turn it back on.

,
Safe: melted ice cubes; water drained from the water heater (if the water heater has not been damaged); liquids from canned goods such as fruit or vegetable juices; water drained from pipes.






Unsafe: radiators; hot water boilers (home heating system); water beds (fungicides added to the water or chemicals in the vinyl may make water unsafe to use); water from the toilet bowl or flush tank; swimming pools and spas (chemicals used to kill germs are too concentrated for safe drinking but can be used for personal hygiene, cleaning, and related uses).







,, In addition to having a bad odor and taste, contaminated water can contain microorganisms (germs) that cause diseases such as dysentery, cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis. If water treatment is not possible, put off drinking suspicious water as long as possible, but do not become dehydrated."
"
Understand that sanitation is vital so that germs do not spread via contaminated cookware or food.,
Cook food using the available implements.,
Look for alternative storage space for perishable food if you are without power for a long time.,
Keep garbage in closed containers and dispose outside, burying if necessary.,
Keep your hands clean by washing them frequently with soap and water that has been boiled or disinfected.

,
Use only pre-prepared canned baby formula for infants and avoid using powdered formulas with treated water.

",How to Manage Food and Water While Taking Shelter in Emergencies2," Keep food in covered containers and utensils clean. Discard any food that has come in contact with flood water, been at room temperature for more than two hours, or that has an unusual odor, color, or texture. Also discard foods from cans that are swollen, dented, or corroded, even though the product may look safe to eat.


Thawed food usually can be eaten if it is still “refrigerator cold.” It can be re-frozen if it still contains ice crystals. To be safe, remember, “When in doubt, throw it out.”

, Alternative cooking sources in times of emergency include candle warmers, chafing dishes, fondue pots, or a fireplace. Although canned food can be eaten out of the can without warming, you can heat the contents by removing the label, thoroughly washing and disinfecting the can (use a diluted solution of one part bleach to 10 parts water), and opening the can before heating.

, If the weather is cold enough, set food outside, perhaps in a hole in the ground or buried in the snow. Or, use dry ice. 25 pounds of dry ice will keep a 10-cubic-foot freezer below freezing for 3-4 days. Use care when handling dry ice, and wear dry, heavy gloves to avoid injury.

, Do not allow garbage to accumulate inside, both for fire and sanitation reasons.

,,"
"
Consider the type of emergencies your particular home is most likely to face.,
Cook perishable foods.,
Have stable foods that don't require refrigeration.,
Have a back-up method of heating food and water.,
Have a back-up method for heating or cooling your home during a blackout, depending on your climate's needs.,
Prepare by equipping your house with automatic power failure safety lighting so that it does not go dark when the power goes out.,
Power outages can mean 'get out of the house' during the day if it is safe to do so.,
If you can afford it, get a powerful Portable Power Outlet like ATOM or a Portable Power Generator.,
Remember that there will be no TV, no light, and games that need reading will not be able to be played.,
Keep a battery powered camping ""lantern"" available.,
Keep a battery powered radio available to monitor local news and emergency developments.",How to Make a Power Outage Bearable," A blizzard-prone area will be different from one in a tropical area that commonly faces hurricanes. Urban areas face different challenges than rural areas.;
, If the temperature rises, take anything out of the refrigerator that might spoil and prepare to cook it or consume it before it warms up. Eat perishables before spoilage can occur.

, Those that do not require cooking are even better.


Canned meats, fish, soups, vegetables, and juices will work, and can be kept for months at a time. Crackers, cookies and snacks for the kiddies are a necessity. Eat these items after the perishables are eaten or are unsafe to eat.
To make perishables last longer, avoid opening the fridge unless absolutely necessary. The air in the fridge will remain cold for a limited amount of time, even after the power goes out. But the more you expose it to room temperature, the faster it will warm up and the faster your food will spoil. You can also minimize heat gain by packing everything in the fridge tightly together.

, A camping stove is ideal (and be sure to know how to use it safely — see warnings). A barbecue grill will work quite well, but do not bring it into the house. (You don't want carbon monoxide poisoning.) A gas stove can often work if you have matches for ignition. Remember to have plenty of fuel on hand for your camp stove or barbecue in case your adventure lasts several days.


Water is actually more important than food, and if your water supply is pump-driven, it may give out in a power failure. Put aside many gallons or liters of drinking water. Fill your bathtub or pails with water for flushing the toilet, washing, and so on.
Read the article titled How to Get Emergency Drinking Water from a Water Heater.

, Do you need to stock up on wood for the wood stove? You should consider buying portable fans, and cold water rinses to stay cool. If your home runs on natural gas or propane, install a gas fired fireplace that has its own thermopile electronic ignition. Should you get a gas-powered generator?

, Many of the commercial style emergency lights look pretty bad on the wall of your kitchen or living room, and they typically only last 90 minutes - day or night.


Try to find power failure safety lights that sense darkness before going on. Otherwise the batteries will be dead before darkness comes.
New power failure safety lights just hitting the market deliver light for long periods of time because of the improvements in LED brightness and battery life.
Look for power failure safety lights on the web and find ones that you can install in any room of your home without being an eyesore. Start with the kitchen and bathrooms - the two most used rooms of the house.

, Go to the mall, or take in a movie. Have a few good meals at a nearby diner or at a fast food restaurant.


Unless you are snowbound, or ill, there is no reason to stay indoors and be uncomfortable. There's plenty of time for that when it gets too late to stay out.

, A few basic necessities can be plugged into these. Think lights, fans, laptops, cell-phones and radios. Don't expect to power your whole home off of one of these. Some portable power generators can even power your refrigerator.

, Turn on your flashlight only when you need to move about. You can make up your own games, sing songs, or practice the ancient art of talking with one another. Be playful if possible.


Read a book to pass the time. Remember, this can only be done during the daylight hours. At night, the best thing is to go to sleep. Time passes faster when you sleep, especially when there is nothing else to do but wait.

, These will light a room better than a flashlight. Also, keep a ""manual"" can opener handy to open animal food cans as well as other preserves.

, Cell phones will also lose their charge quickly, so having a battery powered cell phone charger is also a good idea.

Find out if your community has a Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC).,
Contact the LEPCs to find out more about chemical hazards and what needs to be done to minimize the risk to individuals and the community from these materials.,
Prepare an emergency supplies kit and make sure to include plastic sheeting, duct tape, and scissors.

",How to Survive a Hazardous Materials Incident1," The responsibilities of the LEPC include collecting information about hazardous materials in the community and making this information available to the public upon request. The LEPCs also are tasked with developing an emergency plan to prepare for and respond to chemical emergencies in the community. Ways the public will be notified and actions the public must take in the event of a release are part of the plan.;
, The local emergency management office can provide contact information on the LEPCs.

Listen to local radio or television stations for detailed information and instructions.,
Stay upstream, uphill, and upwind if you are outdoors during an incident.,
Stop and seek shelter in a permanent building if you are in a motor vehicle.,
Stay indoors if you are instructed to do so.,
Turn off air conditioners and ventilation systems.,
Go into the preselected shelter room.",How to Survive a Hazardous Materials Incident2," Follow the instructions carefully. You should stay away from the area to minimize the risk of contamination. Remember that some toxic chemicals are odorless.

, In general, try to go at least one-half mile (usually 8-10 city blocks) from the danger area. Do not walk into or touch any spilled liquids, airborne mists, or condensed solid chemical deposits.

, If you must remain in your car, keep car windows and vents closed and shut off the air conditioner and heater.

, Close and lock all exterior doors and windows, vents, fireplace dampers, and as many interior doors as possible.

, In large buildings, set ventilation systems to 100 percent recirculation so that no outside air is drawn into the building. If this is not possible, ventilation systems should be turned off.

, This room should be above ground and have the fewest openings to the outside. Seal the room by covering each window, door, and vent using plastic sheeting and duct tape. Use material to fill cracks and holes in the room, such as those around pipes.


Ten square feet of floor space per person will provide sufficient air to prevent carbon dioxide build-up for up to five hours, assuming a normal breathing rate while resting.






However, local officials are unlikely to recommend the public shelter in a sealed room for more than 2-3 hours because the effectiveness of such sheltering diminishes with time as the contaminated outside air gradually seeps into the shelter. At this point, evacuation from the area is the better protective action to take.

Act quickly if you have come in to contact with or have been exposed to hazardous chemicals.,
Find out from local authorities how to clean up your land and property.",How to Survive a Hazardous Materials Incident3," Open windows and vents and turn on fans to provide ventilation.

, Do the following:


Follow decontamination instructions from local authorities. You may be advised to take a thorough shower, or you may be advised to stay away from water and follow another procedure.






Seek medical treatment for unusual symptoms as soon as possible.






Place exposed clothing and shoes in tightly sealed containers. Do not allow them to contact other materials. Call local authorities to find out about proper disposal.






Advise everyone who comes in to contact with you that you may have been exposed to a toxic substance.







, Report any lingering vapors or other hazards to your local emergency services office.

Protect your head with a helmet.,
Cover yourself with strong (yet mobile) clothing.,
Wear easy-to-shed layers.,
Wear sports pads to protect your limbs.,
If you're male, wear a cup.,
Wear shoes that allow you to run.,
Consider wearing sheets of protective material under your clothes.",How to Make Protective Riot Gear1," Your head is perhaps the single most important part of your body to protect in a riot. Batons, rubber bullets, rocks, and fists can all cause permanent damage if they strike you in the head. Even weapons that aren't meant to be shot directly into protesters, like tear gas canisters, can (and have) caused major injuries and deaths this way.To protect against critical head injuries, wear a sturdy helmet. Rioters are known to protect themselves with:


Bike helmets
Motorcycle helmets
Hard hats/construction helmets
Sports helmets/headwear
Police/military surplus helmets;
, Generally, you won't want to be caught in a riot in your shorts and sandals. The more skin covered, the better, as many anti-riot weapons, like pepper spray, rubber bullets, and so on, are most effective against bare skin. However, you won't necessarily want to wear clothing that's prohibitively heavy or bulky, as, often, the best defense against danger is simply to run away. Below is just one sample outfit that you might want to consider:


Heavy but well-fitting jeans that you can run in.
Tee-shirt or undershirt.
Long-sleeved overshirt of heavy cloth or flannel.
Tough jacket (sturdy leather or cloth works well.
Scarf (optional)

, While it's important to dress to protect yourself, you won't want to commit too heavily to the outfit you're wearing during a riot. Try to wear clothing you can easily remove if the need arises (and that you won't miss if you have to abandon it.) Being able to slip out of an outer garment quickly can have some major advantages. For instance:


It can allow you to slip out of someone's grasp.
It can allow you to escape noxious chemicals (like tear gas and pepper spray) that have seeped in to your clothes.
It can allow you to easily ""cool down"" during breaks in the action when you get a chance to rest.

, If you have a chance to visit a sporting goods store, protective pads and guards can be very helpful in a riot. Though not quite as heavy-duty as the gear riot police are likely to wear, they can often prevent scrapes and bruises and may even offer limited protection against batons and rubber bullets. Commonly-available pads that you may want to consider wearing are:


Shin guards (soccer/football, hockey)
Knee guards (skating)
Thigh/hip guards (American football)
Elbow/wrist pads (skating)

, For obvious reasons, it's a good idea to wear a cup to a riot if you're a man. Don't forget this seemingly minor addition to your riot gear — it can be a lifesaver.

, As noted above, often, your best defense in a riot is simply to get away from sources of danger — in fact, even die-hard anarchist resources often prioritize a rioter's need to stay mobile over his ability to resist physical damage.This is much easier to do if you're wearing shoes that allow you to run at a sprint. Try to wear at least reasonably tough athletic shoes or boots that are worn-in and comfortable.


Heavier boots (like police or military surplus options) can offer additional protection but may make it hard to run if you're not used to them.

, If you find that it doesn't impede your ability to move, you may want to add strips or plates of hard protective material under your clothing to protect you from the hazards of rocks, rubber bullets, fists, batons, tasers, and so on. To attach these makeshift pieces of armor, stick them to the inside of your clothing with sturdy tape or string strips together with cloth to make a wearable ""apron."" Suitable materials may include:


Sheet metal
Thick, hard plastic (PVC, etc.)
Tough leather
Kevlar or other tough fibers

"
"
If possible, wear a gas mask.,
Use a builder's respirator when a gas mask isn't possible.,
Use improvised mouth protections as a last resort.,
Wear eye protection (but not contacts.),
Be prepared to change clothes.,Consider using hydrophobic sprays such as NeverWet to deflect liquids and gasses, as well as keep from seeping into your clothes.,
Consider bringing gloves.",How to Make Protective Riot Gear2," For the best odds of escaping riot-control agents (RCAs for short)unscathed, there's no beating a genuine gas mask. However, these aren't usually cheap. Decent-quality gas masks will rarely cost less than about $100-125, while replacement filters can easily cost $40-50 per pack. .Don't forget to bring at least one replacement filter canister with you. If the current canister starts to fail in the middle of a tear gas attack, you'll be glad you brought additional protection.
Note that it is difficult and uncomfortable to perform actions such as running while wearing a gas mask.
Note also that gas masks are subject to export restrictions in some states and countries, so check your local laws before traveling with one., If you can't get your hands on a gas mask, be prepared with a half-face respirator (which can usually be found at hardware stores.) Though these don't offer the full-face protection of gas masks, they should at least make it easier to breathe (and, in addition, they are usually cheaper.)Another reasonable alternative to a gas mask is a device called an ""escape hood"", which is essentially a plastic bag with a breathing filter used to protect from smoke inhalation when escaping a fire. These are cheaper than gas masks and aren't usually subject to the same regulations., The drop in quality from professional-grade gas masks to lesser solutions is large. However, any sort of barrier between your face and the RCA is better than nothing. If you have nothing better handy, cover your mouth and nose with a surgical mask, a dust mask, or even a bandana. While these won't protect you from inhaling RCAs, they may at least provide some protection while you escape.

, If you don't have a full-face gas mask, well-fitting eye protection is a must. Almost all of the RCAs that are designed to incapacitate rioters via inhalation will also cause eye irritation, pain, and even temporary blindness.


Airtight safety goggles are a good bet in terms of eye protection. These are often used in chemistry labs and are sometimes sold in college bookstores.
If you can't find safety goggles, even ordinary swimming goggles can work well so long as they can keep an airtight seal., Tear gas, pepper spray, and other RCAs can seep into your clothes is you're exposed to them directly. If this happens, the harmful agents will be held against your body and can cause major irritation or even chemical burns. To avoid this, shed any clothing that is exposed to an RCA as soon as you're out of danger. You may need to wash your clothes before using them again or discard them, depending on how much RCA they have been exposed to.Don't forget that a high-end gas mask won't make you invincible against RCAs, as it will do nothing to protect your clothes.

,, One common tactic rioters use to fight against tear gas is to throw the canisters back at the police who shot them. However, this isn't wise to do with your bare hands, as tear gas canisters can get very hot (and, in addition, you'll be exposing your bare skin to the gas itself.)Thus, you may want to bring at least a single sturdy glove for dealing with tear gas canisters (or just limit yourself to kicking the canisters.)

"
"
Make a shield.,
Sew or tape carbon fiber into your clothing to stop tasers.,
Consider making a homemade tear gas rinse.",How to Make Protective Riot Gear3," For protection beyond what you can get from sturdy clothes and makeshift armor, consider building a shield. Depending on the size, thickness, and material of your shield, it may potentially provide protection for you and others against rubber bullets, rocks, and batons (especially if used in conjunction with others' shields). Ideally, a shield should be as hard and sturdy as possible, have a U or V shape facing towards your person, and have a padded arm strap and grip handle set at a 65 degree angle to make blocking projectiles and strikes as well as supporting the shield easier. Additionally, a second handle on the middle of the shield can be added for an extra sturdy grip. This is most effective for deflecting blows from melee weapons. As a better form of deflecting projectiles, you can use a handle parallel with the ground. This handle design is used in heavier ballistic shields that are employed by the police. You also may want to add a way to see through the shield, but be cautious, as an empty hole in the shield large enough for even rubber bullets is dangerous. Try a metal mesh reinforced with lexan or plexiglass behind it. The shield should not be so large or heavy that it makes it hard to move.


Get creative with the ""canvas"" that a broad, flat shield offers you. Some protestors involved in the 2014 unrest in Ferguson, Missouri were able to use their plywood shields as protest signs by painting the fronts of the shields with messages and slogans.Be resourceful and look for things around you that can be effective shields. Protesters involved in the 2014 anti-government riots in the Ukraine improvised heavy-duty shields made from materials like sheet metal and old iron doors.Note that lexan is expensive and you may want to opt for less expensive materials.

, While a single shock from a high-powered taser can completely incapacitate even a large man, with the right protection, it's possible to protect yourself.Carbon fiber, a modern composite material with a wide variety of applications, has been found to stop most tasers and stun guns from harming the person on the other side of the fabric. However, since you can't simply buy a carbon fiber shirt, you'll need to add it to your clothes yourself.


Carbon fiber is available commercially in a broad selection of textiles, weaves, and tapes.There are even iron-on carbon fiber sheets available, which are ideal for adding to existing clothing.

, The painful, burning sensation from tear gas can be excruciating. If you or someone near you gets hit with teargas, having something ready to rinse the chemical out of your mouth, nose, and eyes can be an absolute godsend. Below are just a few anti-RCA rinses that are possible to prepare at home:


Some sources state that mixing Campden tablets (which contain the active ingredient sodium metabisulphate and are used in home brewing) with water produces a solution that neutralizes tear gas.Protesters have been known to use lemon juice, milk, and other kitchen ingredients to help rinse away tear gas. However, there haven't been scientific studies to prove whether these are as effective as other solutions.When all else fails, use clean, clear water. It's been proven to be fairly effective at treating eye inflammation (especially when used generously)."
"
Don't rely on soaked rags or bandanas for teargas protection.,
Don't wear lotions, creams, etc.,
Don't wear gear that can be perceived as military/police-related.,
Don't bring weapons.",How to Make Protective Riot Gear4," One common myth is that soaking a bandana or piece of cloth in certain liquids will make it ""filter"" or ""neutralize"" the chemicals in tear gas. This is not supported by scientific evidence.Below are a few such ""tricks"" that you should not count on:


Soaking a bandana in vinegar
Soaking a bandana in water
Soaking a bandana in citrus juice
Rubbing a wet bandana with crushed charcoal

, Wearing oil or cream-based lotions is a bad idea in a riot. These topical products can ""catch"" particles of tear gas, pepper spray, and other RCAs, holding them against the skin and making it difficult to rinse them off.If you need to ""clean up"", instead, use a simple soap-and-water rinse.

, Gear that is explicitly police or military surplus can offer lots of protection, but it's often a bad idea in a riot. For instance, if it's too convincing, it may trick rioters into thinking that you're actually part of the military or police, which, depending on the conditions, can be very unsafe. On the other hand, if the police at the riot are eager to attack or arrest rioters, this sort of gear can also call unnecessary attention to yourself by being perceived as aggressive or disrespectful.

, It should go without saying, but, to be clear, it's a bad idea to arm yourself before a protest. Having a weapon makes you a prime target for the police, even if you only intend to use it to defend yourself. In martial law situations, a weapon may even be reason enough for police to target you with deadly force. In short: bringing a weapon to a riot makes things much less safe for yourself and the people around you, so don't do it.

Pack it so that the more essential things are in an easy to reach location, and the items that are less important (such as the clothes) be in a stored location.,
Forget about all electronic devices (except a flashlight), they are usually heavy, make noise, give your location away, and are next to useless when the batteries die or an EMP attack is carried out.

Collect two weeks’ worth of food and water.,
Add restraints.,
Get a cat carrier.,
Make a copy of your cat’s records.,
Put aside extras of your cat’s medications.,
Add some supplies for your cat’s comfort.,
Don’t forget litter supplies.",How to Make an Evacuation Kit for Your Cat1," The most important component of your cat’s evacuation kit is a supply of food and water. When determining the amount of food and water your cat will need, estimate about 14 quarts of water (448 ounces), plus your cat’s usual daily food intake multiplied by 14.Don’t forget to include extra food and water dishes. Having the food and water won’t help your cat if they have no way to consume it!
If your cat’s food usually comes in metal containers, don’t forget a can opener.;
, Your cat might not normally wear a harness, collar, or leash, but these are good things to include in your evacuation kit. Your cat may get nervous in new or unfamiliar places and situations created by an emergency, and these supplies can help keep your cat restrained.If your cat becomes very panicked in unfamiliar situations, you might want to consider including a pair of leather gloves with these supplies to protect your hands from scratches.

, If you don’t already have a carrier for your cat, you should get one to include with your cat’s evacuation kit. The carrier should have your name, cat’s name and description, and your phone number and address listed on it. Include an alternate phone number in case you’re not at home and someone finds your cat and needs to contact you.You should also include your cat’s insurance policy number and microchip or tattoo ID if applicable.

, This should include vaccination certifications, your and your vet’s phone numbers, a copy of your cat's insurance, and your ownership papers (if you have any). You can also include a current picture of your cat, which will help identify you as the cat's owner if someone else finds it., You should also put aside a two week supply of any medications that your cat takes. You can also include one dose of preventative heart worm medication. This is especially important since in the event of an emergency, your cat might be around other animals or in an unfamiliar place where contracting heart worm is more likely.


If your cat’s medications need to be refrigerated, include a few chemical ice packs in your kit. Cracking these packs when they’re ready for use will give you an ice pack without the need to keep anything frozen., In the event of an emergency, your cat will be outside of its comfort zone. Including some familiar toys, a blanket, and grooming supplies like a brush and nail clippers can help keep your cat comfortable in an emergency.A pheromone spray like Feliway can also contribute to your cat’s comfort. Spraying it on your cat’s toys and blanket, and in the areas where they’re staying during the emergency, sends your cat a signal that they are in a safe place.

, Some pet stores and websites sell litter sets specifically for emergencies. They often include a collapsible litter pan and a small scoop. You can create your own by purchasing a small litter pan and scoop and including paper towel, garbage bags and a disinfectant to keep your cat’s litter box clean during an emergency.

Storing them in airtight containers prevents them from going bad and ensures you have fresh supplies regardless of when an emergency hits., Your cat’s emergency water supply should be stored in an airtight container. It should also be stored somewhere dark and cool to prevent mold growing in it., A waterproof container will protect your cat’s meds from getting soggy or becoming useless if the emergency you have to deal with is a flood., Once you’ve assembled and properly stored all of your evacuation kit items, print up a list of the supplies in your kit. This will help you keep track of what’s in the kit, and will also prevent you from forgetting what’s in there in the first place!, Printing out a calendar that shows when which supplies should be rotated will help prevent you from having bad food or medication in your cat’s kit. You should check the calendar once a month to ensure everything stays fresh.Food should be rotated out every three months, water and medication should be rotated every two months.

, You don’t want your cat’s paperwork to get soaked in the rain or ruined by a flood, so consider storing it in a waterproof pouch. Many sporting goods stores have these types of bags – they’re usually advertised as being useful for rafting or camping trips. You can also just use a large plastic storage bag., Once you’ve collected all of your supplies and put them in their respective containers, put everything into a larger plastic tub.

, You should add food and water to the bag first, since these are the most important for your cat. Grab what food you have at hand - either a bag of dry food or several cans of wet food. You should also add several bottles of water.


Also include your cat's water and food bowls.

, Any paperwork you have for your cat - vaccine, owner, or insurance paperwork - should also go in the bag. If you don't plan on making your kit ahead of time, at least keep this paperwork in one place so it's easy to take if you need it.

, Your cat probably has a few go-to toys that are its favorites. When you're putting together a last minute evacuation kit, include these in your bag. They'll give your cat something familiar in what can be an unfamiliar and sometimes scary situation.

, You might not have time to get an extra or travel litter pan during an emergency, but you probably have a container of litter and a scoop at home. Include these, along with any container that is big enough for your cat to use as a litter box. The container should be at least big enough for your cat to stand up in.

, Towels will keep your cat comfortable and warm in an emergency. You can also use them to swaddle your cat if you don't have an actual cat carrier.

,, Turn the control to the lowest setting. This will freeze the blocks faster, depending on the amount of time you have before the storm or other hazard hits your area. It will also ensure that the fridge is extra cold should the power go out, giving your food a better chance of surviving the hazard event.

, Leaving enough in freezers to keep them cold as well. In a severe weather or other hazard event resulting in long term power outages, this will buy you time to use food before it spoils. Remember to eat the most perishable items first.

Go to a hardware store and buy a 50 lb (20 kilogram) magnet.,
Stop the elevator on the lowest floor.,
Spot the keys.,
Dangle the magnet.,
Lower the magnet until it touches your keys.,
Know the key can get stuck.,
Tie the string to the telescoping magnet and lower it through crack like a clock hand.,
Success!

",How to Get Your Keys out of an Elevator Shaft3," (That means, a magnet that can pull 50 pounds, the magnet doesn't weigh that much.) They are very small and inexpensive (2 to 3 dollars). Buy thin but strong rope to tie to the magnet. Also buy a telescoping magnet. They are about the width of a pen, and extend to about 2 feet (0.6 m). You will also need 1 or 2 bright flashlights, a yardstick (or broom handle), and scissors.

, The elevator should have either a stop button, or have someone in your building use the key to keep the elevator on the bottom floor and the doors open. If there is another elevator next to ""your"" elevator, stop that elevator on the bottom floor as well.

, Set up your flashlight and find your keys by laying on the ground and shining the flashlight through the crack. They should be no more than a few feet away. If possible, use another flashlight and also locate your keys from the elevator ""next door"". This is possible only if the elevators are relatively close (no more than 8 feet, most likely) by angling your flashlight so you are able to see the floor of the elevator shaft (and your keys).

, Tie the 50 lb magnet (tightly!) to a long piece of string. You need to get the magnet beneath the elevator, dangling on the string. This is difficult, because the magnet will stick to the metal side of the elevator and the shaft. You can wrap the string around the magnet a bunch of times, stick your arm out the side of the elevator (yes, into the shaft and yes, it is scary) and throw the magnet. Don't forget to hold the string! The string should unwind and leave your magnet on the floor.


If dangling doesn't work, use a long stick. Take the magnet and shove it down the shaft, along the walls to which it is sticking, with a yardstick or other long narrow object. Remember, the idea is that it should dangle.

, This should be relatively easy, unless your keys have bounced a bit and you can't see them. Then you will need someone at the elevator next to yours to guide you in the ""swinging"" of your magnet. Once your keyring sticks to the magnet, pull it up slowly!

, Sometimes, even once you have your keys, it becomes impossible to get them up through the crack, because your magnet gets stuck to the bottom or sides of the elevator and your keys fall of when you yank the magnet. At this point it is necessary to use the telescoping magnet.

, Because the magnet is small and not as strong, it should easily pop off the side and dangle. Repeat step six.

In the event of an emergency, it is likely that your national, state/provincial, regional, local, or tribal health department will make specific recommendations for boiling or treating water in your area.;
, It is vital that you don't try to eat food items that are not safe - the emergency services will probably already be stretched to their limits and you can do without having sick family members during an emergency. It is important to:


Throw away food that may have come in contact with flood or storm water.
Throw away food that has an unusual odor, color, or texture.
Throw away perishable foods (including meat, poultry, fish, eggs and leftovers) that have been above 40ºF/4.4ºC for 2 hours or more.

Note that thawed food that contains ice crystals or is 40ºF/4.4ºC or below can be refrozen or cooked.


Throw away canned foods that are bulging, opened, or damaged.

, Floodwater is contaminated water and can infect food:


Food containers with screw-caps, snap-lids, crimped caps (soda pop bottles), twist caps, flip tops, snap-open, and home canned foods should be discarded if they have come into contact with floodwater because they cannot be disinfected.
If cans have come into contact with floodwater or storm water, remove the labels, wash the cans, and dip them in a solution of 1 cup of bleach in 5 gallons/3.7 liters of water. Relabel the cans with a marker. Include the expiration date.

,, While the power is out, keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible. Add block ice or dry ice to your refrigerator if the electricity is expected to be off for longer than 4 hours. Wear heavy gloves when handling ice.

Breastfed infants should continue breastfeeding. For formula-fed infants, use ready-to-feed formula if possible. If using ready-to-feed formula is not possible, it is best to use bottled water to prepare powdered or concentrated formula. If bottled water is not available, use boiled water. Use treated water to prepare formula only if you do not have bottled or boiled water.
If you prepare formula with boiled water, let the formula cool sufficiently before giving it to an infant.
Clean feeding bottles and nipples with bottled, boiled, or treated water before each use.
Wash your hands before preparing formula and before feeding an infant. You can use alcohol-based hand sanitizer for washing your hands if the water supply is limited

, The US CDC recommends discarding wooden cutting boards, baby bottle nipples, and pacifiers. These items cannot be properly sanitized if they have come into contact with contaminated flood waters. Clean and sanitize food-contact surfaces in a four-step process:

"
Be conscious that water may not be safe to drink, clean with, or bathe in after an emergency such as a hurricane or flood.,
Listen to and follow public announcements.,
Use only bottled, boiled, or treated water for drinking (however, see guidance above for infants), cooking or preparing food, washing dishes, cleaning, brushing your teeth, washing your hands, making ice, and bathing until your water supply is tested and found safe.,
If you use bottled water, be sure it came from a safe source.,
Boil water.,
Do not rely on water disinfection methods or devices that have not been recommended or approved by local health authorities.,
Use water storage tanks and other types of containers with caution.,
Practice basic hygiene.",How to Keep Food and Water Safe After a Disaster or Power Outage2," During and after a disaster, water can become contaminated with microorganisms, such as bacteria, sewage, agricultural or industrial waste, chemicals, and other substances that can cause illness or death.

, Local authorities will tell you if tap water is safe to drink or to use for cooking or bathing. If the water is not safe to use, follow local instructions to use bottled water or to boil or disinfect water for cooking, cleaning, or bathing.

, If your water supply is limited, you can use alcohol-based hand sanitizer for washing your hands.

, If you do not know that the water came from a safe source, you should boil or treat it before you use it.

, When practical, boiling water is the preferred way to kill harmful bacteria and parasites. Bringing water to a rolling boil for 1 minute will kill most organisms. Boiling will not remove chemical contaminants. If you suspect or are informed that water is contaminated with chemicals, seek another source of water, such as bottled water.


If you can't boil water, you can treat water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or unscented household chlorine bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite). If you use chlorine tablets or iodine tablets, follow the directions that come with the tablets. If you use household chlorine bleach, add 1/8 teaspoon (~0.75 milliliter ) of bleach per gallon of water if the water is clear. For cloudy water, add 1/4 teaspoon (~1.50 mL) of bleach per gallon. Mix the solution thoroughly and let it stand for about 30 minutes before using it. Treating water with chlorine tablets, iodine tablets, or liquid bleach will not kill many parasitic organisms. Boiling is the best way to kill these organisms.

, Contact your local health department for advice about water treatment products that are being advertised.

, For example, fire truck storage tanks and previously used cans or bottles may be contaminated with microbes or chemicals. Water containers should be thoroughly cleaned, then rinsed with a bleach solution before use:


Mix soap and clean water in container. Shake or stir to clean inside of container, then rinse.
For gallon- or liter-sized containers, add approximately 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) household bleach (5.25%) with 1 cup (240 mL) water to make a bleach solution.
Cover the container and shake the bleach solution thoroughly, allowing it to contact all inside surfaces. Cover and let stand for 30 minutes, then rinse with clean water.

, Wash your hands with soap and bottled water or warm water that has been boiled or disinfected. Wash your hands before preparing food or eating, after toilet use, after participating in clean-up activities, and after handling articles contaminated with floodwater or sewage. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer to wash your hands if you have a limited supply of clean water.

Find a qualified contractor.,
Install suction for grade-on-slab homes and those with basements.,
Vent homes with crawlspaces.,
Discuss other mitigation options.,
Talk to a water treatment specialist.,
Buy a granular activated carbon (GAC) filter.,
Install an aeration system.,
Hire a radon measurement professional.,
Buy a do-it-yourself testing kit.,
Test your water for radon, too.",How to Limit Home Radon Exposure," Limiting radon in your home will take someone with training and knowledge in mitigation techniques. Ideally, look for a contractor certified by the National Radon Proficiency Program (NRPP) or the National Radon Safety Board (NRSB). These are the only two national organizations in the US that certify radon professionals.The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) suggests that people hire contractors who certified nationally or on the state level.
Call the NRPP or NRSB to see about certified providers in your area. Many states also have licenses or certification programs, so try those organizations as well to see if contractors are available.
When choosing a contractor, be sure to ask for references, proof of credentials and insurance, and a clear legal contract.;
, Homes that have basements or that use grade-on-slab construction, i.e. concrete poured at ground level, will need suction devices to limit radon from the soil. There are a few different kinds of soil suction systems, including sub-slab suction, drain tile suction, sump hole suction, and block wall suction. These systems will cost between $800 to $2,500 to install with a contractor, but the average is around $1,200.Sub-slab suction is the most common system. This is when pipes are inserted through your home’s foundation slab into the soil underneath. The radon is then passively or actively (with a fan) moved through the pipes and into the atmosphere.
Drain tiles placed in the ground around the foundation will direct radon-containing water away from your house, as well.
Block wall suction is for basements with hollow, cinderblock walls. This technique involves removing radon from the interior of the blocks, where it gets trapped.

, Consider having the contractor install a ventilation system if your home has a crawlspace underneath. Crawlspace ventilation can reduce levels of radon in your home by lowering the intake of radon through the soil and by “diluting” the amount beneath your home.You can do this either through natural ventilation or a forced-air system. In the first case, the contractor will need to open vents or install new ones to move air from the crawlspace outside. The air should circulate naturally.
A forced air system also uses vents but with the addition of a fan. The fan forces air out and pulls outdoor air inside, for a continual exchange.
Keep in mind that a forced air system will cost more. Fans can range anywhere from $25 to as much as $1,000.

, There are some other, smaller techniques that you can use to limit radon in your home. Talk to your contractor to see whether they will work for you. Most of these additional options will not solve the problem alone, but are useful when combined with other mitigation systems.Seal up any cracks in your home’s foundations. Sealing prevents radon from leaking into your home while limiting the loss of conditioned air – it therefore makes your other mitigation measures more efficient. Sealing is also fairly inexpensive and easy to do.
Pressurize your home. Consider installing a fan to blow air into the home from upstairs or outdoors and to maintain enough pressure indoors to keep the radon out.
Open more natural vents, including windows, doors, and vents on lower floors. The inflow of outside air will dilute the amount of radon inside.

, Radon in water poses a risk because the gas can enter the air, especially through the shower, and over time can raise your risk for lung cancer. Ingesting water with radon also raises your risk for cancers of internal organs like the stomach. Call water treatment services in your area to find out whether they sell treatment systems designed for radon removal.Look for water treatment services in the phone book or online. You can also call the EPA’s Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791 or inquire at your state’s radon office.
Be sure to ask any treatment providers whether they not only install but also maintain radon systems. Certain systems need regular servicing or they will not work properly.

, If your water has tested positive for radon, you can treat it effectively with a point-of-entry system like a GAC filter. This means that radon will be removed from the water before it enters your home’s distribution system. GAC filters are one of the most common kinds of point-of-entry systems.A GAC filter collects 95% of radiation by absorbing it in a carbon filter. It has a fairly low up-front cost, but requires you to remove, replace, and safely dispose of the carbon filters.
You may need help disposing of used GAC filters if the radiation levels are too high. Make sure, again, to talk to your treatment specialists to see if they offer disposal services.

, The other point-of-entry option for radon in water is an aeration treatment system. In this technique, an air diffuser is put onto a water storage tank and blows air up through the water. As the air rises, it strips radon from the water and is then vented out of the house through pipes above your roof line.Expect to pay more upfront for aeration. You’ll have to install a storage tank and air diffuser, hook it to your home’s water system, and add proper ventilation for disposal of the tainted air.
Aeration is more costly but also more effective. A system can get rid of as much as 99% of radon from your water. There are also no regular disposal costs, as with a GAC filter.

, If you are concerned about radon in your home and want to get tested, think about hiring a professional. Look for people who are certified to measure levels of radon in the air and water, starting with your national and state radon offices.In the US, try the NRPP or NRSB and state radon organizations to find out about licensed contractors and services in your area. Make sure that any professional is accredited or licensed.
Also, consider getting tested between the months of September and April. This is when your windows are usually closed – you’ll get a more accurate measurement that way.

, You can also do the testing yourself. A home radon test kit will cost you between $30 and $60 at many hardware stores. Alternatively, try ordering one online or by phone. Radon test kits usually come in two forms: short-term and long-term.Short-term kits measure your home’s air for between 2 to 90 days. Test the air in the lowest area of the home where you spend time.
Some governments suggest using a “long-term” test kit, however, which will measure the radon in your air for a minimum of three months before going to a lab for analysis. Long-term kits will give a more accurate reading.
Apart from stores or online, you can order a testing kit from the National Radon Hotline at 1-800-767-7236 or from the National Radon Program Services at Kansas State University – the latter offers discounted kits for sale online or by phone.

, Radon can come in part from your water and get into the air through things like your shower. Not all water contains radon, though, and water from wells is much more likely to have it than water from surface sources like rivers and lakes. Make sure to get the water tested if your air tests positive, but especially if your water also comes from the ground.If your water comes from a public source, call the municipality to find out whether it is from a surface (lake, river, reservoir) or ground source. Most radon diffuses into the air with surface sources. If you are using ground water, ask the provider if they’ve tested for radon.
If you use a private well, call the EPA’s Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. They will be able to direct you to your state’s laboratory certification office, which can connect you to a water tester.

Mark your routes.,
Inform others.,
Assess the situation.,
Proceed quickly to an exit.,
Get some distance.,
Check in with responders.,
Get clearance.,
Assess any damage.,
Update evacuation plans.",How to Evacuate a Building in an Emergency," Office buildings, hotels, restaurants, and other commercial spaces often have pre-established evacuations plans and procedures. Check with building management to find out about the evacuation protocol if you are in this type of building.Look for evacuation maps on building doors and in public areas such as lobbies and stairwells.
If you are looking for evacuation plans for your office, check with your manager or the company head regarding current evacuation plans and what roles different people are to fill during an emergency.;
, Find routes that will get people out of the building with the least risk during an evacuation. Look at your building plans to help people find the exits nearest to them, and create an evacuation plan that takes people to their nearest exit quickly and safely.Try to avoid potential hazards such as going through kitchens or areas with large windows. These pose excess risk as lines in kitchens can break and exacerbate emergencies while windows may blow out and cause increased risk due to glass.
Be sure to avoid mechanical transportation such as elevators, as these could fail and put people at an increased risk. Use stairwells whenever possible.

, Provide clear markers for people to guide people to exits from the building. Post evacuation maps throughout the building, and mark exits with clear “EXIT” signs.In spaces that do not get much natural light, such as interior hallways, you may also want to consider placing photoluminescent strips along the sides of the floors to help guide people to the nearest exit.

, Make sure other people using the building know about the evacuation plan. Help them identify their nearest exit and tell them about safety precautions such as avoiding elevators.It may also be helpful to appoint safety monitors to help guide others in the event of an evacuation if you are dealing with a large space that holds a great number of people.

, If possible, find out why you are evacuating before you leave the building. Knowing why an evacuation has been called can help you modify your plan if necessary to best accommodate the circumstances.If, for example, there is a fire that blocks your nearest exit, you know to go in the opposite direction of the fire, even if another exit is further away.
If there is an active threat such as a bomb threat or an armed person spotted, seek instructions from authorities such as the police or fire department before attempting to evacuate.

, Once you know you are to evacuate, proceed quickly to your nearest exit. Do try to avoid panicking, as panic can quickly disorganized a group, slow down the evacuation process, and put more people in danger.Do not worry about gathering belongings that are not immediately within reach. Taking time to pack a bag or go to another room once an evacuation has been called is dangerous. Take only what is already on your person or already packed and within arm’s reach.
If possible, exit through your nearest clearly marked exit sign. If a standard exit truly is not accessible, look for other ways out of the building such as through a window.

, Once you have exited the space, make sure to put safe distance between you and the building. Depending upon the situation, authorities may have set up a do not cross line to indicate a safe distance.Consider whether there is a designated meeting place outlined in your evacuation plan. If you are supposed to meet with others in a designated area, proceed directly to that area.
Think about how much space is necessary for different types of emergencies. An emergency such as an electrical problem in the building likely requires less space than something like a fire. Consider how much space you need based on the reason for evacuation.

, Once you are a safe distance away from the building, check in with the authorities or emergency responders to let them know you're safe and see what your next steps need to be. This is also the time to let someone know if you have been injured during evacuation.If no authorities or first responders are present, call the police or fire department as appropriate to warn them of potential threats and receive further instruction.

, Before you reenter the building, make sure you get clearance from emergency responders that the building is safe and whatever threat caused the evacuation has been contained. Do not reenter a building that has not been inspected by the proper authorities.If you were sent away after an evacuation, call to check in with building manager or local authorities to make sure the space is safe to re-enter.
Let them know, ""We had to evacuate because of an emergency, and we would like to know if it is safe to reenter the space?""
Additionally, it may be helpful to ask, ""Are there any precautions we should take when going back into the space for the first time?""

, If physical damage was done to the space, take careful note of what damage occurred and what may be harmed or missing. Report any damage to the building manager, or to the authorities and your insurance if you own the building.In addition to noting damaged items, note anything that seems lost or stolen.
Take photographs or video of the damage as well as thorough notes in case it is necessary for you to file an insurance claim.

, Take this evacuation experience as an opportunity to work out kinks in your plan. Check with others if possible to see if there were obstacles or moments when the evacuation was slowed or stalled, and update your plan accordingly.


If an evacuation was particularly slow, look for alternative routes or consider dividing people up more evenly among exits.
Recap with the evacuated group to address any problems that you saw and suggest improvements for the future.

, Water moves toward the lowest point possible, so these places are prime locations for finding a lake or stream.


Rainwater may collect in these areas.
If you are in a mountainous area, check for water at the foot of cliffs.

, Circling birds can sometimes indicate a water source nearby, but you might also follow animal tracks. Water is a basic need for all animals, and the tracks you follow will likely lead you, eventually, to a watering hole., Mosquitoes in particular are an indication that water is nearby, as is the presence of flies, which tend to remain about 325 feet (100 meters) from water. Generally, most insects do not stray too far from water sources.


Keep your eyes peeled for bees as well. Bees build hives three to five miles away from a water source.

, If you are in an arctic area, or an area that receives snowfall, you should collect snow that has a bluish look to it. This will prevent you from consuming frozen water that his high in salt content, which could contribute to your dehydration.


Frozen water that has a higher concentration of salt will appear gray or opaque.

, There are many ways you might melt your ice into water that will quench your thirst. In extreme situations, you may have to find a container and then cuddle it, using your body heat to melt the snow. In other cases you may be able to use a match, lighter, or other heat source. Once the snow has melted, you may purify the water using several different methods, such as:A water purifying tablet to cleanse the snow, now turned to water, for consumption.
A filtration device, like a water purifying straw, to drink your thawed snow.
Using your heat source to bring the melted snow to a boil. Allow it to boil for a least a minute to guarantee the water has been purified.

, If you notice water begging to puddle at the bottom of your hole, you're in luck.

, Instead, you seek water in vines, cacti, and roots.Cut a notch in the plant and wait for liquid to seep out. In the case of cacti, break it open and suck moisture from its pulp, being careful not to eat any of the cactus, as it could make you sick.Generally, you should avoid drinking plant sap that is:Thick
Colored
Sour or bitter
Sharp or unpleasant in odor

, Drinking water that is poisonous, contaminated with parasites or bacteria, or is tainted by human waste can cause serious health complications.This can be a threat to your survival in an emergency a wilderness experience. Illnesses associated with contaminated water include:Dysentery
Cholera
Typhoid

, Sweat will make you dehydrate faster, so you should avoid activities that may make you sweat while looking for water. You should also:


Stay in the shade, if possible.
Avoid eating anything while thirsty.
Damp your clothes in hot conditions to cool yourself in hot climates.
Carry materials, like a plastic sheet, to make water collection devices., You can do this simply by bringing water to a boil over a fire, though this might not always be an option. To ensure you don't end up drinking water potentially tainted with parasites or bacteria, you should consider:


Carrying water purifying tablets.
Purchasing a simple water filtration device, like a water purifying straw.

, Flowing water will not be stagnant, and stagnant water is an ideal breeding ground for many disease-carrying insects and parasites. When deciding on whether or not a source of flowing water is safe to drink, keep in mind:


The location of the nearest human settlement. The downstream area of rivers can easily be tainted by human activities.
The mouth or origin of a water source will likely be safest for drinking."
"
Safety first - If the system you are looking at has something that burns in (like natural gas or propane), make certain that the area is well ventilated and there is nothing that will make a spark while you do your test.,
Mix a few tablespoons of dish soap into a container of water.

,
Wet down the suspected parts with the soap solution.",How to Detect Gas Leak,";

Use a cricket bat/2x4/baseball bat.,
Strike back with an American football helmet/bike helmet.,
Garden hose tubing: Garden hoses can be used if you tie a knot in it and set it around your hand and it makes your punches harder.

,

, There are 2 things you can do with these. One is to wear the helmet and headbutt the burglar. The other is to hold them in your hand and swing them.

,,,, A glass bottle can be used by smashing it over the trespasser's head to cause pain and give you time to find a means of restraint.

, The latter method causes more pain but is slower to be able to swing again. It is also an effective method of restraint.

, A loaded paintball fired at close range causes a lot of pain and a strategically placed shot to the groin can incapacitate the trespasser.(NEVER aim above the shoulders unless you want to possibly get in trouble with the police.)

, BB guns and air rifles look a lot like real guns to the untrained eye and should be able to persuade an inexperienced burglar to flee or surrender. If the burglar is not buying it (i.e he knows it's not a real gun) then use them same way as the paintball gun.

, A sliced lemon should be used to squeeze citric acid into a trespasser's eyes which should blind them and give you some time.

,, Slip them over your hand and use to punch. If the shoe is a tall lady's one then you can hold the leather and swing it.

, A cattle prod can be used to shock people into submission. However it should NEVER be used unless you fear for your life. If you do need to use it aim for the limbs or abdomen, never aim at the torso or head.

, A small hole punch can be slipped over your hand and used like makeshift knuckledusters. Make sure the lower bit is on the flat of your fist as this is far less painful to you than placing them on your knuckles.

, can be used if you take a swig and hold it in your mouth. When needed, spit it as hard as you can into the trespasser's face which will either temporarily blind or distract the trespasser as well as freak him out.

, Firing water at high speed from a pressure washer at the trespasser is a good tactic because it hurts and it distracts along with temporary blinding if fired at the face.

, Use the handset by having it held in the hand and swung downwards to make a good bludgeon but this will probably break the phone.

Check the legal and zoning requirements.,
Plan and research every aspect in great detail.,
Think carefully before committing to a bunker under your home.,
Consider soil.,
Plan for the cold.,
Get to know your landscape.,
Consider using heavy machinery.,
Go without machinery if desired.,
Consider other finishing touches and safety measures.",How to Dig a Bunker," This is the step where we tell you to make sure you are legally allowed to dig your bunker. If you excavate illegally and someone finds out, you will face a fine and have to fill it in, or your council will fill it in and charge you for the privilege.;
, The below stages are listed in order that they occur, but each stage needs to be considered before the project is started.

, Digging a bunker under a home has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages include that the entrance to the bunker can be concealed, and it is easier to supply electricity, etc.


Disadvantages are many. Messing with the foundations of a house can be disastrous. Access will likely be poor, perhaps preventing heavy machinery which will make things slow and difficult.






Excavated soil may be more difficult to remove, or may create a messy trail through your home.






You may have to dig through a concrete floor, which requires heavy equipment which will need to be rented. Pockets of natural gas, radiation, and mold all may be encountered during the construction of the bunker, and this is not ideal with your home is directly above. You do not want to poison your family as they sleep, or cause the whole house to blow up as methane escapes. Damp and mold are also unwelcome.






Generally, it's better to choose a site distant from any building. The best place is away from any trees, as their roots will make things harder.







, Soil type also needs to be considered. Sandy soil is more prone to cave in. Clay is less likely to collapse. Rocky soil is difficult to dig out.

, Depending upon where you are in the world, you may have to think about what effect cold weather will have on the ground. When the ground freezes and thaws, the soil expands and contracts. This may lead to collapse.

, Ideally, you want to know what is beneath your feet before you start. Will you hit bedrock straight away? Where is the water table? You do not want to return the next day to your site to find it flooded. Do your research, know your soil.


The site also needs not to interfere with any underground cables, pipes, etc. This is another reason to build away from structures. Seriously consider getting a professional involved to advise you about a site.







, You can use a backhoe or excavator to excavate out a large hole, then place or build a structure inside the hole, and then finally use the excavator to bury the structure again. Mini backhoes can be hired if you want to do it yourself, or the larger ones can be hired with an operator (e.g. for the day).


Dig down as far as you want, and keep the excavated soil close by, but far enough away from the hole so that it does not fall back in. Remember the pile of dirt will become very large very quickly. Soil in the ground is compacted, and when it is dug up it occupies more space.






When you have dug as deep as you require, make sure the surface is level. It is easiest to place a manufactured structure in the hole, and a shipping crate is a readily available and passable for this purpose. They are not too expensive, but you may be surprised how much they cost, even old ones. However, it will need to be lowered into the hole, and this will require more heavy machinery.






An alternative is to build your own structure in the hole. The floor needs to go down first. Take a while to plan the materials at this stage, it can mean the difference between damp and moldy and comfort. Cemented bricks or concrete blocks are a cheap and strong material for the walls. Using wood for the structure is not desirable, they will rot if you use untreated wood, and treated wood releases toxic chemicals that are unsuitable for an underground bunker. Wood is also less permanent and less strong than brickwork or cement blocks.







, The second, slower and more dangerous method is to dig out the bunker from the entrance and shore up the tunnels as you go. This is not recommended unless you really know what you are doing. Try to always have a phone, (call for help if you survive and are then trapped by a cave in), and a light. Leaving an emergency shovel and water to hand may save your life.


This kind of digging can be a nightmare and can be very slow. It is also much more likely to lead to collapse. The ideal plan for this kind of bunker is a large circle shape. If one part collapses you can still get out round the other side. You need to take great care with how you shore up the walls and roof, with planks at first, but ideally solid brickwork.






Scaffolding poles can be used to prop up the ceiling, but this approach should not be trusted to secure larger rooms, only passageways. Use brick pillars instead of scaffolding poles for a more permanent measure.






If you hit solid rock, you should have chosen a better site. You need heavy equipment to break it up, or you can drill a hole and place explosives and then try to blast it out bit by bit (not recommended). You can hammer wooden wedges into cracks to try to break pieces off. If you live somewhere cold, try pouring water into the cracks and then leaving it overnight. The water expands when it freezes and may break pieces off.







,


Water-proofing the bunker. A simple plastic sheeting laid below the floor, and similar measures for the walls and roof may be needed to prevent water and damp seeping in.






Sound-proofing of the roof and walls. This way your bunker will remain undiscovered even if loud music is playing and it is near the surface. You do not want to live in fear and have to whisper.






Concealing and securing the entrance. This is more difficult if the bunker is in the middle of open ground. Consider planting quick-growing trees or landscaping the ground around to look natural. Another idea is to make the entrance look like a manhole cover. Another option is building a shed or other small structure on top of the entrance. An entrance is much more easily hidden inside a building, below the floor.






Power. A generator, or electric supply from the surface.
Ventilation. In deeper installations, air needs to be circulated with vents and fans. Do your research.






Water supply and lavatory. Main water supply may be interrupted during a disaster. Look into rainwater collectors and water purifiers. To have a sustainable toilet within the bunker, a septic tank and leach field will be needed, but the tank needs to be emptied and the leach field rested at intervals (years). Another option is the composting toilet.

Look out for deals that are too good to be true.,
Pay attention to the products you buy.,
Beware products that seem flimsy or are obviously poorly made.,
Inspect the packaging carefully.,
Look for a safety certification label.,
Make sure everything that should be there is there.,
Check the manufacturer's website.",How to Spot Counterfeit Products," Not all fakes sell at lower prices than their genuine counterparts, but an unreal bargain is one of the surest signs of an unreal product. Ask yourself how someone can sell, for example, a brand new $140 tool for $50--chances are it's because it's a fake.;
, Odds are you purchase many of the same products or brands over and over again. Pay at least a little attention to them and you'll be much better at spotting a counterfeit because you'll have something to compare it to. If you're purchasing a brand that is new to you or a product that you don't frequently buy, compare it to the same product at other stores. You can also compare brands against other brands. For example, if you're not sure about a certain extension cord, compare it to others that are for sale in the same aisle. All brands of extension cord will have a lot of the same information and symbols printed on them or on their packaging, so if one particular brand doesn't, it may be a fake.

, Quality control is often absent in counterfeiting operations, so you may be able to spot a counterfeit simply based on its workmanship. Of course, even if it isn't a counterfeit, do you really want a poorly-made product?

, Reputable businesses typically take great care in packaging their products. Beware flimsy packaging, packaging with substandard printing or running colors, or packages that appear to have been opened. In addition, take a moment to actually read the package.


Spelling or grammatical errors are common on the packaging for counterfeit goods. For example, boxes of counterfeit toothpaste that showed up in U.S. stores in June 2007 had several obvious typos, including ""SOUTH AFRLCA"" and ""Assoxiation.""
Does the packaging exactly match the product? Some careless counterfeiters will try putting a fake drill, for example, in a box for a saw. It's rarely this obvious — check model numbers on the packaging against the model number of the equipment, and carefully examine tags on clothing.
Look out for very plain boxes. Most product labels and boxes these days have a whole host of information printed on them, from bar codes to trademark and patent information to recycling symbols. Counterfeiters often don't want to spend the time to reproduce every detail, so they'll likely leave some of this stuff off.
Look for manufacturer contact information. Most reputable companies will provide a phone number or at least an address at which consumers can call them.

, Just about any electrical product, and many other products that could pose some sort of safety risk, will have one or more safety certifications on its label if it's made by a legitimate manufacturer. The UL (Underwriters Laboratory) label is the most common, particularly in the U.S. (the competing ETL mark is also a major certification in the U.S.). In Europe, the CE (the abbreviation doesn't officially stand for anything) marking is required on electrical products, and in Canada the CSA (Canadian Standards Association) mark is common. Look for at least one of these marks on electrical products--there are often several, as well as other minor certifications. Bear in mind, however, that counterfeiters will often include fake marks on their products, so you need to look at them closely. Low quality products that don't claim to be brand-name may also simply use a counterfeit certification mark.


Familiarize yourself with how these marks look. Look at products in your house and in stores. The marks for a given certification are not always the same size, but they always carry the same font and design, and they will include a control number for the specific product. Faked marks are usually, but not always, easy to spot. UL requires hologram marks for most products from China and for some products regardless of country of origin; see their website for details.
If the certification mark is present only on the packaging, but not on the product itself, there's a good chance the product is fake.
Some of these organizations also have online product registries where you can look up a particular product or control number to verify the certification.

, Counterfeit products often don't include supplementary materials such an owner's manual or a product registration card. Sometimes they don't even include all the parts that should come with the product, or some parts will be from a different manufacturer.

, Many large companies now have information on their websites to alert customers to possible counterfeit products and to help them detect fakes.

Try to locate the entry point(s) of the secondhand smoke.,
See if it is possible to pinpoint the source of the cigarette smoke.,
Seal the gaps.,
Any vents no longer in use (common in old buildings) can be sealed by removing the diffuser/grate, cutting a plastic sheet slightly larger than the opening, and attaching the sheet to the opening using silicone caulk as an adhesive.

,
Fit door draft excludes under doors that open into corridors or common areas.,
Seal around windows with caulk or weatherstripping.,
Install extractive window fans.,
Seek rectification.",How to Stop Secondhand Smoke Coming Into Your Apartment," Typical places for the seepage of cigarette smoke from one apartment to another include air vents, pipes (plumbing), gaps in insulation, eaves or other places, electrical outlets, ceiling fixtures, cable or phone jacks, windows and doors. Do not forget to consider balconies and outdoor patios as another possible source. Unfortunately, even the ventilation system can be a source (see ""Warnings"" below).;
, If you have understanding and cooperative neighbors, you may be able to arrange with them to locate exit points in their residence and ask them to deal with these exit points in the same way as your entrance points.

, Gaps should be filled with suitable filler such as insulating foam for large gaps or silicone caulk for smaller ones. Consider gaps around light fittings, electrical points, around air vents, around plumbing items etc.

,, This will help prevent the entry of smoke and other undesirable elements such as dust, pollen and insects. Install a threshold under the door if there is none, and attach weatherstripping on all 3 sides of the jamb.

, Not only will this help prevent smoke from entering off balconies and gardens etc., but it will increase your energy efficiency.

, These will help to draw smoke outside and can help increase ventilation. Seek professional advice on type and installation measures.

, There are some important follow-ups that you might consider pursuing as well as the practical actions in the steps above.


Notify the landlord, building management or other relevant persons that you have the problem. Request that action be taken to prevent the distribution of secondhand smoke through the apartment building. Check the lease agreement or apartment building bylaws to see if you can find additional support.
Check local laws to see if there are bans on smoking in public places, such as gardens and common outdoor areas. It may mean that you can request property management to enforce the laws. If there are not currently laws in place to protect your family and other non-smokers, consider calling or writing to your local law makers. Don't wait for others to protect you and your kids- take action to change local laws yourself.
Ask for compensation from a landlord, property management or other relevant party for the repairs you have made. Keep all receipts and document all repairs made. You may not be successful but it is worth trying and it is even more important to retain this documentation if the matter turns into a legal issue later on.

Identify your ideal escape route.,
Inspect the alarm mechanism to verify it's magnetic.,
Use a magnet to bypass the sensor.,
Return the door or window to normal.",How to Sneak Past Your Home Security System1," You'll find the magnet sensors of most alarms on the windows and doors of your home. You'll want to choose a door or window that's easy to access and escape through. For windows, you'll also want to consider your path after you exit.


Second story windows can be difficult to safely get down from without extra tools, like a ladder. Because of this, these windows should be avoided.If you plan to leave through a window, your best choice may be one that's ground level and roughly chest height.;
, Generally, magnet sensors will look like a small metal box. In some cases, this may have exposed pieces of magnet, which are usually dark in color. The sensor will have two parts. One will be stationary, and the other will be attached to the movable part of your door or window.


When the magnetic bond between the fixed and movable parts of the sensor is broken, the alarm will be activated.
Magnet sensors are almost always placed on the frame of the door or window at the top, bottom, or one of the sides., You should be careful when attempting this, as some sensors are higher quality than others and this technique may not always work. However, in some cases, you may be able to place a fridge magnet on the sensor to trick it into thinking the door or window is closed even when open.For more sophisticated magnet sensors, you may need to use tools, like a screwdriver, to remove the movable part of the sensor on the door or window. Then, place it onto the stationary sensor to make it think the window is still closed.
Before you remove any parts of the sensor, you might first want to take a picture of it with your cell phone. This way, you'll have a reference photo if you have to put it back together later.
You may be able to check whether or not your fridge magnet works by applying it to the sensor and running a check on your security system, if that feature is available. If the sensor reads as closed when the fridge magnet is in place and the window open, this technique should work.

, After you come back, you'll want to re-engage your alarm to prevent burglars from using your temporary escape route. To do this, simply return your door or window to the fully closed position and remove the magnet you used to trick the sensor.


If you removed the movable part of the sensor because your system was more sophisticated, all you have to do is refasten that part into place. If you have difficulty remembering how to reinstall the mechanism, consult the picture you took earlier.

"
"
Determine your exit point.,
Familiarize yourself with the alarm.,
Block the button.,
Fasten your button blocker.,
Remove your button blocker when the alarm is disengaged.",How to Sneak Past Your Home Security System2," Button alarms, much like magnet alarms, are also common for windows and doors.Choose an exit point that is easily accessible, like one that is free of clutter and opens easily. For windows, you should prioritize those that are chest high, as these will pose less of a risk for falling injuries.


Falling from a second story window or higher could cause serious injury or death. For this reason, you should avoid windows this high., Push button alarms will oftentimes have a thin, plastic casing that has a button built into it. When a door or window is opened, the button is released and the alarm is activated.


In many cases, the button will be in the center of its casing and positioned in such a way that when fully closed, the door or the window fully presses it.
Some button sensors may have a casing that contours itself so the sides of the casing form a cradle for the door or window. The button for the alarm is often located in the center of this cradle.

, By placing an object over the button to keep it engaged, you can fool your button alarm into thinking that the window or door is still closed. Depending on your situation, how you do this may vary. In some cases, you might:Open the door or window in extremely tiny increments. Once the button is accessible, but still engaged, use a popsicle stick to hold the button down and keep the alarm from sounding.
Use stiff card stock for sensitive alarms. Even opening your door or window a tiny amount might cause sensitive alarms to sound. Use a thin piece of stiff material, like card stock, and wiggle it between the space between the button and the door or window to hold the button in place.

, To prevent setting off the alarm after you leave, you'll need to fasten your button blocker in place to prevent the alarm from activating. In most cases, you should be able to use a durable tape, like duct tape, to hold your button blocker in place and keep the button pressed.


Many doors and windows are painted. Be careful when applying tape to these surfaces. Sometimes the tape can damage the paint job when you pull it free.For more permanent disabling measures, you may want to glue your button blocker in place. However, doing so will make this point more accessible to burglars as well.

, Your button blocker may be obvious on your window, so you may want to remove it after you're done bypassing your alarm. Since removing your blocker while the alarm is activated may result in you setting it off, you may want to wait until the alarm is turned off before you remove your blocker.

Scout the environment.,
Chart your course.,
Err on the side of caution when sneaking.,
Return with caution.",How to Sneak Past Your Home Security System3," Some cameras are stationary, but others move to pan a wide view of a location. You'll have to study the camera to determine the range of its view if you're going if you're going to sneak by it without being seen.


Some cameras will be oriented at a single important point, like a corner, door, or entrance of a walkway. These may only narrowly focus on that point. Others may focus on a wide/long view, like down a hallway or even the side of a building.
In many cases, there will be other items in the environment, like boxes, chairs, tables, and so on. You might be able to creep behind these to hide from the camera., If you've noticed the camera is angled downward, you may be able to pass by undetected by giving it a wide berth. If the camera is pointing in the distance, you may be able to creep close to the wall outside its view. Planning possible routes before attempting to sneak could reveal even better paths for you to take.


It may help to draw potential routes past the camera on a piece of paper to evaluate your options. Make a simple drawing of the environment, shade the likely area of the camera's vision, and draw lines to represent possible unseen paths you can use.
Some cameras may have be equipped with wide angle lenses to give a broader view. To account for this, you should make the suspected field of vision for the camera slightly larger than you originally think., You might feel silly flattening yourself against the wall at the base of a camera to inch past it without being seen, but if even a piece of clothing or a limb is caught on film, you could be busted. For this reason, you should always give potential areas of the camera's vision as much cushion space as possible.


Before sneaking, you may want to imagine the view from the camera's perspective as a final check to see if you've overlooked something.
When sneaking behind objects, like desks and chairs, try to stay as close to the item as possible. This will cut down the angle of visibility of overhead cameras.
If sneaking behind objects, like desks and chairs, mind that gaps don't give you away and make yourself as small as possible to prevent a limb or piece of clothing from getting caught on camera., When coming home, especially after a fun time with friends, it can be easy to forget the camera and pass by it like you might normally. You'll have to creep by the camera in the same fashion you did while leaving for there to be no trace of your passing.

Secure the scene.,
Determine what was stolen.,
Photograph the crime scene.,
Look for anything left behind by the perpetrator.,
Make note of anything unusual or out of place.,
Call the police.,
Talk to the officers who arrive on the scene.,
Provide any evidence or information you've collected.,
Exchange contact information.,
Get a copy of the police report.,
Talk to your neighbors.,
Check your bank accounts or credit card statements.,
Call local pawn shops.,
Activate any trackers in electronic devices.,
Consider using social media.",How to Solve a Burglary," As soon as you discover a burglary, do as much as possible to keep animals or other people out of the room.


Avoid touching anything that might be considered evidence until the police arrive. Although your fingerprints will be all over everything in your own home anyway, you don't want to disturb any evidence left behind by the perpetrator.Figure out how the burglar got into your home and check outside for signs such as tire marks or shoe prints.;
, Take inventory of your belongings and figure out what's missing or destroyed.


If the burglars left things strewn about and you have difficulty picturing how things were before, you might look through your photos and see if you have any pictures of the room before so you can better recognize what is and isn't there.
Avoid disturbing anything until police arrive, however. For example, if a bookcase was overturned, leave it as it is until police have seen it. Then you can move it and determine if its contents also were stolen.
If you have a safe or a secret hiding place for valuables, check whether it has been discovered or disturbed.
In addition to what was stolen, what wasn't stolen also may be valuable evidence, particularly if the burglar seemed to be targeting certain types of items but left things with obvious value. For example, the burglar may have stolen your movie and video game collection, but left your television and video game console.This information can provide clues as to the type of burglar who was in your home. For example, items such as televisions and video game consoles have serial numbers, so they can be tracked. Many electronics also have anti-theft tracking devices or software installed. Movies and video games, however, are virtually untraceable and can be easily sold at pawn shops or other stores that buy and sell used media. Therefore, a burglar who steals those items and leaves others probably is a rather risk-averse criminal who needed quick cash.

, Photographs can help you see things you didn't notice before.


You also want to have evidence of the way things looked. After the police have left, you will want to clean up and put things away, but having pictures could be valuable later.
The way the burglar moved through your home and searched for things to steal may provide clues about the type of burglar he is, including his age and his level of experience. For example, a burglar who ransacked the place and destroyed other property in the process may be someone who is younger and more inexperienced, while if it's obvious specific items were targeted and nothing else was touched, the burglar is more likely to be someone with more experience who knew what he was after and what he could get rid of quickly and easily for maximum profit., Sometimes the person who robbed you will leave dirty handprints, footprints, or other evidence.


The sloppier the burglar was, the more evidence he or she probably left behind. Additionally, if the burglar broke windows or glass, either on the way into the home or during the course of the burglary, there may be blood from which police can extract DNA evidence., Anything the burglar did that was unrelated to stealing your stuff could be part of the criminal's signature.


These details may seem unimportant to you, but could become the key that unlocks the identity of the suspect – especially if police have noticed a pattern of similar crimes occurring in close geographic proximity.Burglars often repeat not only the crime but the way they commit the crime, so evidence of unusual activity unrelated to the crime may help identify the perpetrator of several burglaries.For example, some burglars have habits such as making a sandwich or playing video games while they're in the house. These activities can provide evidence as well as link your burglary to other pending or unsolved burglaries in the area., You should report the crime as soon as possible after you discover you've been burglarized.


Many burglaries go unreported, but reporting the incident quickly increases the chances that your property will be recovered or the perpetrator apprehended. Thieves tend to get rid of stolen items quickly, so the longer you delay the less hope you have of getting anything back.
Since many burglars are repeat offenders, they may be well known to your local police., Providing the officer as many details as you have about the crime can help them trace leads and narrow the field of suspects.


The officer will want to know when you discovered the burglary and how long you were away from home (assuming you weren't at home when the burglary happened). These details enable him or her to narrow the window of time during which the burglary took place.Describe the items stolen in detail. If you have serial numbers for any electronic devices you should provide those as well. The more detail you can provide to the officer, the greater the chance your items will be recovered.If you don't have serial numbers for stolen items, provide as many details as you can. If there are any identifying markings, make sure you share that information with the officer.For example, if you have stickers on your laptop's case, you might describe them. If an item has any scratches or dents from wear and tear, the location of those defects also can help identify your property.
The method of entry for the burglar can be important information, because if your burglar was a repeat offender, he may have found a favorite method that he uses every time. Additionally, the method of entry may provide clues about the type of burglar. For example, if the burglar entered in a way that would have caused a lot of noise or disruption, this might tell you that the burglar was reckless and not concerned about getting caught in the act., If you've discovered anything unusual or any items left behind by the burglar, hand it over to the police.


Additionally, if you have any photos of any of the stolen items, you might want to provide those to the police as well., The officer may need to contact you as the investigation progresses, and you may need to update your report.


Particularly if the room was ransacked or if there is overturned or broken furniture, you may not notice some items are missing until after you start cleaning up.
While you probably will notice the absence of larger items right away, you may not realize smaller things are gone until several days after the burglary. Additionally, if the thief only stole parts of a larger collection, such as DVDs or video games, it may take some time for you to go through the remaining titles and figure out what's missing.
Ask the officer if he or she will check other reports filmed around the same time as the incident to see if any other suspicious activity was reported in your area. The reports may be connected and may lead to the perpetrator., You may have to go to the police station to get a copy of the written police report that the responding officer filed.


If you have homeowner's or renter's insurance and plan on filing a claim, the insurance adjuster probably will need a copy of the police report for the claim records.
Additionally, if any credit cards or financial information was stolen, you may need to provide copies of the police report to your bank or credit card companies when you report the theft to them.

, People who live nearby may have noticed something, or may have additional information about other burglaries in the area.


If any of your neighbors have surveillance cameras, they may have captured the break-in or related activity on video.
If you talk to anyone who has any additional information – for example, your neighbor describes a van parked in front of your home around the time of the burglary – make sure you call the police and update your report as well.

, If any of your cards were stolen in the burglary, unauthorized charges can lead to clues that could help identify the burglar.


You should report stolen cards to your bank or credit card company right away to limit your liability for any unauthorized charges, but there's a chance the card may have already been used.If the card has been used at a location that has a security camera, you may be able to use the information from your statement regarding when the card was swiped to obtain video footage of the burglar.If you get any information about the suspects this way, make sure you provide the information to the police as soon as possible so they can be apprehended. Although police may need more evidence tying them to the burglary before they have probable cause to charge them with that crime, they may be able to identify them or charge them with a lesser offense in the meantime., The burglar may try to sell the stolen property at pawn shops in the area.


If something rare or distinctive was stolen, it's much more likely that you'll be able to find it than if it's a common item and you have no record of its serial number.
Although pawn shops typically are required to check databases for stolen items, providing store owners or employees with a description of your items can help ensure they're keeping an eye out for them.

, If your phone or computer were among the items stolen, you may be able to locate them using built-in tracking technology that can find the device using GPS.These trackers can help locate your device, or even the perpetrator of the burglary. However, let the police know if you've searched for your electronics in this way. It's safest for you if the police follow the lead, rather than if you go by yourself to retrieve your device.

, Posting information about the burglary can lead to additional information and potential leads in your case.


Encourage everyone who follows your accounts to share your post, even if they don't have any additional information for you.
Particularly if you have any video or pictures of the suspect or the suspect's car, someone may be able to identify him or her – especially if you live in a relatively small town or rural area."

Decide if you want a professionally installed security system or prefer a do-it-yourself approach where you will buy and install the system.
,
Get a system with no more than a one-year monitoring contract.,
Count the number of entrances and windows in your home that need to be secured.,
Get at least one smoke detector on your system and include automatic monitoring.,
Keep all main level doors contacted with a device to tell the main panel that it has been opened.,
Consider using motion detectors in areas where multiple windows are accessible from ground level.,
Think about how your basement fits into your security options.,
Walk around your home prior to having a company representative arrive for a proposal.,
Decide if you want to pay a monthly fee for monitoring.",How to Select a Security System for Your Home,", Signing a contract can help reduce the up-front cost of equipment, however you must take into account a cancellation fee if you want out of the contract down the road.

, This will help in deciding how many sensors you will need., Should you be away from your home the smoke detector can save some of your valued belongings.

, If you have several doors that can not be reached with wiring, you can protect them with an area coverage motion detector, typically 35 foot (10.7 m) range.

, This can also cut down on total cost.

, If your basement is unfinished, the wiring of the main level plus the basement windows and doors are easier for the technician. If you have a finished basement, sometimes a wireless addition to your system may be required to protect your basement, windows, doors and your main floor. Today's wireless systems are a lot more reliable than in the past. Also, by having a wireless receiver on your system you have access to key fobs that can arm and disarm your system remotely and also send emergency alerts to your system.

, Look for the most accessible and hidden areas to determine the areas that you want covered the most. Look for a good spot for your keypad which will control your system. It is sometimes convenient to have a second keypad in your bedroom. Also look for a centralized closet or an unfinished basement area for your main box of electronics.

, A monitoring company can send alerts to local authorities if your security system reports a break-in, fire, or other emergency at your home. While this feature is convenient it may require you to pay for an alarm permit from your city. Also, multiple false alarms can result in fines up to several hundred dollars from your local municipality."

Choose an appropriate firearm.,
Choose different sizes or gauges depending on effect.,
Decide your course of action, before you do anything.,
Know what's in store if you decide to search and clear.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm1," Exploring your house for that unidentified sound in the night or to going to the aid of a loved one with empty hands is not a smart idea. Equipping yourself is therefore important. The three main categories of firearms are pistols (handguns), shotguns, and rifles. The very first step is to intimately familiarize yourself with firearm safety rules. For example, be sure of your target and what's beyond it. Don't shoot your teenage son sneaking back into the house. Also, remember that most likely the bullets you are firing will go through the walls in your house, and could therefore strike loved ones.


Consider tactically preparing yourself with a pistol for suggestions on arming yourself with a pistols. Pistols are a lightweight, efficient, and popular choice for personal defense.
An alternative, and highly recommended, firearm to have would be a pump-action shotgun. Shotguns have much better stopping power than a pistol. A pump-action is recommended as reliability is of the utmost importance, but you can also use break-action shotguns to good effect.Don't be fooled by those who say that shotguns are point and shoot. Shotguns take as much training and practice as pistols and rifles.

Rifles are the third common option. Rifles, again, produce (even in some smaller calibers) significantly more stopping power than most pistols, but they require just as much precision. A magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifle is the suggested choice as two hands may not always be available, and the option to quickly shoot multiple rounds is often a welcome one.;
, For pistols, the largest pistol possible is recommended for the best stopping power and controllability, while for a rifle or shotgun (from now on they will be called ""long guns""), the shortest length possible is preferred. These preferences are obviously ""within reason"", as a 4-foot-long freak-pistol, or a 12-inch-long long gun are impractical and defy the intended use of the specific weapons.

, If you are the only one in the house, or everyone in the house is in the room you are in, then your choices are much easier. If you are sure there is a very-unwelcome guest in your house, call the local police. Lock the door to your bedroom (and any other entrances — if available), and be prepared. Do not move, wait for the police to come. Do not approach the police with a firearm in your hand, be sure to holster it or set it down once the police are in your immediate vicinity.


The reason why you wait in this situation is because searching a house is very dangerous, and nothing (other than loved ones) should be worth dying over. Plus, insurance should cover any stolen or damaged items.

, This should only be done if you know an intruder is in your house and you have loved ones elsewhere in the house. Be sure you call the police before you take any actions, and be sure to tell them you are armed and that you are going to try to retrieve or protect your loved one(s).


The other situation in which you might need to use these techniques is if you are unsure about an intruder and you wish to make sure there is no danger. In this case you should also arm yourself with a cell phone, as you may need to call the police while not near a land line.

Pick your spot.,
Construct your package.,
Bury your package.,
Disguise the spot.,
Don't touch it.,
Keep quiet.",How to Bury Valuables to Keep Them Safe," You must pick a burial ground that leaves you a window of time alone and out of sight in which you will bury your package. This window of time must be no less than an hour (longer if the package is large), and occurring at least once a week. Why? Because if you get into some hot water and need to retrieve the package as soon as possible, you don't want to have to wait around for a month until you can dig it up unseen. Tips for picking a spot include:


Make sure your spot isn't scheduled for construction or anything that might cause it to be built upon, dug into, or otherwise obstructed from your ever getting to it. A few examples of badly chosen terrain might be: an empty lot, a spot near a water main, a spot close to a public road or a playground/school.
The spot must have ground that is easy enough to dig with a shovel. You don't want to be spending all night digging, and the use of large digging machines isn't conducive to secrecy!
The spot must be easily found again without the use of a map. You should be able to find the spot in the darkness and completely by memory. Also, should the situation arise where you need to verbally convey to someone where your package is so that they might retrieve it (i.e. through a pane of plexiglass at a police station), you'll need to be quick and precise in your description.
Don't pick a spot where your package might be moved by natural forces. A beach might not be the best idea as sand is moved to and fro on a daily basis. The same thing goes for a swamp. (Although you don't have to worry about moisture because your package will be more than watertight, as you'll read below)
Don't pick an obvious spot. If somebody is searching for your package they should not be able to find it in your backyard. Pick a spot that has no ties to you or your family, friends, accomplices, etc.;
, Your package must meet three requirements: a) Watertight, b) Structurally sound, and c) as compact as possible.


Do not use anything metal, such as screws or metal products. Robbers who may use metal detectors can easily locate your valuables through the detector. The following steps will show you how to create your package:
First, take your object and put it into a heavy duty garbage bag. Use duct or packaging tape to completely cover the package two times over. This is the first step to ensure water tightness.
Repeat three times for a total of four garbage bag/tape jobs. Your package is now watertight.
Measure your now watertight package and construct a wooden box using wood panels one inches thick. Make certain your package will fit snugly inside of the box, so as to avoid creating a box bigger than necessary.
Insert your package into the wooden box and repeat the garbage bag/tape job two times for good measure. You now have a watertight, structurally solid package that will last many years under the earth!

, During your window of burying opportunity, sneak to your chosen destination and dig. Dig fast and dig true; don't dig the hole any wider than is required, as you will be wasting time and energy.


For maximum security, it is recommended that you bury your package no less than 2 1/2 - 3 feet deep. It will take more time and effort, but your peace of mind over the years to come will be well worth it.
Once your hole has been dug, place your package into it and cover it with a layer of good-size rocks.
Spray some pepper spray or Mace into the hole. This will deter any animals from potentially smelling something interesting and digging up your package.
In thirds, fill the hole with dirt, step into it and compress the dirt with your feet (so as to avoid a sinkhole in the following weeks), and use the pepper/mace spray. Repeat until the hole is full.

, Dig up a nearby shrub and plant it on your spot, cover it with a rock, or plant some grass, anything to make it look like someone hadn't just been digging there.

, Leave your package alone until you are ready to retrieve it. Don't check on it, don't poke at it. View it from afar if you have to, but don't go near it. If for some reason you do need to dig it up, don't put it back in the same spot. You've taken a big enough chance getting it into the ground the first time. Another attempt doubles your chances of detection.

, Nobody is going to be impressed with the fact that you buried something, so don't show off. Unless it is imperative that someone else knows about your secret, keep it that way: a secret!

Approach the corner.,
Observe the corner and keep in your mind that the pivot point will be the apex of the corner.,
Take a small step 90° away from the wall.,
Pause and scan the slice of the pie.,
Practice by setting up a mirror in the room.,
Always point your firearm where your eyes are looking.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm2," The most common object in a house is a corner (and the most common solution for an object is the same as clearing a corner). The process of traversing a corner is often referred to as slicing the pie.Start as close to the wall as possible without scraping up against the wall. Make sure that you are at least an arms length away from the corner. You don't want your firearm to stick out into the doorway.

, The further you step away from the wall, the more open space you'll sight.

, This is the start of a semi-circle you will make around the corner. Keep your elbows in and your front foot parallel to your line of sight so that neither will give you away.

, Between each step taken you should scan from the floor at the corner to the ceiling — scanning each slice in a vertical motion.


Your form will be: a firm, two-handed grip on the firearm. You will be leaning slightly toward the direction you are stepping to allow your head (and your eyes) to be the furthest object, allowing you to see your target before he sees you.
If you are proficient with both hands, use whichever hand that will keep you most concealed.
Your feet should never cross, as it is a very unstable position, and if something (or someone) were to hit you, or you are forced to shoot mid-stride, your accuracy and balance will be compromised. Instead, you want to move your lead foot (the foot in the direction which you are stepping), then follow with your trailing foot. Also, be aware of your feet; make sure you are not pointing your toes into the corner as they may precede your eyes, which means the suspect may be able to see you before you see him.

, As you are slicing the pie, check to see what you can see in the mirror. Try to adjust your form so that little more than your eye and your firearm are visible.


You can also practice with another person using flashlights. As soon as one of you sees any part of the other, shine your flashlight on them. The competitive nature of this drill will sharpen your form quickly.

, This will allow you to react more quickly than if you have your firearm at low ready. Arms extended or high-compressed ready are both good options.A high-compressed ready position is achieved by holding the firearm with both hands close to the chest and elbows slightly elevated. With high-compressed ready, make sure that your non-firing hand is behind the plane of the muzzle.

"
"
Know the dangers of doorways.,
Approach a closed door on the side the handle is on.,
Touch the handle of the door, and ""soft-check"" the handle to see if the door is locked or not.,
Bring your gun to close-contact firing position as you reach for the door handle.,
Turn the handle quickly and swing the door open.,
Step back from the doorway immediately.,
Scan the room the same way you would go around a corner.,
Move into the room once you have viewed as much of the room as possible.,
Look over your shoulder as you enter to view the corner you are not heading toward.,
Clear the rest of the room for any immediate danger.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm3," The fatal funnel, as it is graciously known, is one of the most dangerous areas to be in when traversing a building. This area includes doorways and other portals which only allow a narrow area in and out of a room (such as narrow hallways and archways). If you were picking a choke point for an ambush, fatal funnels would be perfect places to focus your attention. It is in your best interest to spend as little time as possible in these areas.


At a doorway, the fatal funnel is the area on either side of the door, as deep as the door is tall and just as wide.So standing to the side of a door does not count (obviously the fatal funnel is an imaginary area — an area which the intruder might not be respecting, so just because you are out of the fatal funnel doesn't mean you can't get shot).

, If you are unable to do so (for architectural reasons), you will have to place your body in the fatal funnel while you open it.

, If this is your house, and you know this specific door does not have a lock, you don't have to perform this step.

, When grasping the doorknob, use your non-firing hand and reach below your weapon. This will allow you to bring your weapon to bear without blocking it.

, If you are pushing the door away from you, be sure to swing the door enough so to expose the whole room. If the door stops unusually short of the wall, it may be because something or someone is behind the door.


If you pull the door toward yourself, the amount of throw is less important as even a small opening will allow you a peek in the room right away, and as you clear the room you can open the door the rest of the way.

, This keeps you and your gun away from someone who may be on the other side of the door ready to grab you or your gun. Distance favors the trained shooter. In the event that you are the only one with a gun, distance favors the person with a ranged weapon.

, This time, you have to scan up to 180-degrees instead of only 90. Clear it with the slicing the pie technique. Be sure to start at the wall the door frame is attached to clear as much of the room as possible. You should know all of the hiding places in your house and pay particular attention to them as you're clearing the room.


When crossing the fatal funnel during the pie slicing, you may want to speed up your pace to spend as little time in the fatal funnel as possible without missing important parts of the room.

, Start outside of the fatal funnel and move in toward the caddy-corner area. This is a diagonal motion, and it should be done quickly, being sure you don't get hung up on the doorway.

, If someone were hiding in the corner that you weren't able to see during the slicing the pie you will be able to see them now.


The corner you are walking toward is your first priority. View that corner before you look at the one behind you, as an assailant in the corner in front of you is a higher priority.

, This may include looking behind furniture and in closets. You do not want to leave an area unsearched; as soon as you leave the room, you assume no one is behind you, when in fact someone may be.

"
"
Approach the door on the doorknob side (as before).,
If you are on the non-hinge side, push open the door open as wide as you can.,
Enter toward the doorknob side (just as the other doorways and openings) while the door is still mostly open.,
View the corner you are walking towards during the small window of time the door is closing.,
Turn and view the corner behind you, before the door closes.

,
Clear the rest of the room as you would any other room.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm4," Self-closing doors include spring-loaded or hydraulic-closing doors. Common in most residential houses for the garage access door, this presents a set of problems when being approached from the non-hinge side. If the door opens toward you (you are on the hinge-side of the door), open the door and either use your shoulder or your foot to push it more open as you clear the room.

, Depending on the speed at which the door closes, you may have time to move to the opposite side of the doorway before you enter. This is probably your best option.


If you can, move to the opposite side before you enter. This gives you a brief moment to very quickly scan the room for any obvious potential targets.
If you are unable to step to the opposite side of the doorway, you must zig-zag into the room.

, Entering will take some quick thought and adaptation. You must be quick on your feet; the door may automatically close or close faster than you're prepared for.


You must quickly commit to entering; this is the only way to retain any element of surprise you may have. The fatal funnel becomes many times more deadly if you allow the door to close before you go through it; now an intruder on the other side of the door knows you must approach that door again to open it.
Use movement to your advantage. During high stress encounters, you and your adversary will likely have tunnel vision. Simply zig-zagging as you enter the room may cause you to completely ""disappear"" for a second or two.

, The door will cover the corner to your back temporarily. If you see this corner is clear before the door has almost finished closing, you may have time for a quick scan of the room, but your priority is the corner behind the door.

,, Also be aware that many self-closing doors will slam loudly when they shut. Be patient and maybe spend a minute or more waiting in that room to see if someone comes looking for you.

Think about what kind of a shelter you want to build.,
Print out the instructions for the shelter you want to make and cross out each step when completed.,
Gather the tools which include shovels and saws.,
Assign different tasks to different individuals according to their strengths and weaknesses.,
Choose an area that has no flammable material around it.,
When digging, pile up the soil at least five feet away from the trench.

,
Dig the trench as deep as you want to, but remember that the lower it is, the more room you have and it may improve blast protection.

,
When finished digging, place the logs/poles on top of the trench.,
Now that you have the logs on top of the trench, MAKE SURE TO cover any cracks with for example cloth or leaves.

,
When you are absolutely positive that there is no way for the dirt to get into the living space, place the soil you dug out on the logs, so that the layer of earth is at least 18 inches high.,
Build a toilet of some sort on a space separated from the rest of the shelter with at least a blanket or a cloth of some kind.

,
Make beds of some kind.,
Since no one likes to be trapped inside a fallout shelter if a fire happens, make sure you have at least two different exits in your fallout shelter.

",How to Build a Fallout Shelter," Do you want to have the highest RPF (Radiation Protection Factor, meaning how much radiation is reduced. For example, RPF 100 means that a person would receive 100 times less radiation than a person completely unprotected), or are you going to strive for a high blast protection? Think about where you live and consider which you need the most. Keep in mind that this decision will either kill you or keep you alive.

, If this shelter does not satisfy your needs, there are instructions for many more out there.

,;
, A good idea may be to have half of the group dig while the other half gathers the poles/logs.

, When a nuclear weapon detonates, it creates a thermal pulse which can set things 20 miles (32 km) away on fire. If you don't have a choice, at least buy a fire extinguisher and clear the area around your shelter to the best of your abilities.

,,, Make sure to cut the logs AT LEAST 1 foot (0.3 m) wider than the trench!

,, If you want to increase RPF, make a higher layer.

,, If you are running out of time, a couple of inches high layer of leaves/pine needles etc will be fairly enough. If your skills permit, make a bunk bed. The easiest solution would be to bring some extra blankets and make a ""bed"" out of two blankets on top of another.

Say something funny.,
Listen for any rustling or breathing from the closet.,
Look for any signs that your closet has been opened or tampered with, generally a badly closed door or something moved out of the way.,
Turn on the light (or use a flashlight) to peer inside the closet before opening it if your closet has a slit in it.,
If you have a temperature gun and your closet has cracks, fire that inside and look for temperature spikes.,
Lock your closet somehow.,
Ask ""Is anyone inside of my closet?"",
Slowly open the closet door, having a good grip on the handle and using your foot to prevent the door from opening far.

,
Repeat step 7 until the door is fully open.",How to Tell If Someone Is in Your Closet," Make sure that it is truly funny. If you hear giggling then that is a sure tell sign someone is in there.;
, Clothes generally create no noise but air conditioners can mask the sound. In a nice, quiet, room, you can hear the person in your closet breathing.

, Keep in mind that someone inside your closet generally will have a hard time closing the door.

, If not, try looking under the closet to see feet. This step should be taken with caution, as the person inside may notice and pop out at you. But remember, as the person outside, you have the best control over the doors!

, This high-tech technique is nearly sure to find anyone hiding inside.

, Make sure that it makes a noise locking it. Then fake closing you door ( open the door, count to 2, then close it ). If someone is inside there, they would be freaking out because they can't get out.

, While this approach seems rather basic, it may catch your hider off-guard!

,, Then, using a hand (or pole), poke your clothes or any hiding spaces gently to check for people. If you find none, congratulations, your closet is clear.

Understand that hallways present some of the more difficult, dangerous, and dynamic areas of a building.,
Walk on one side of a hallway or the other.,
Handle obstacles such as doorways the same as mentioned above.,
Keep track of what areas you have cleared and which ones you have not.,
Methodically clear hallways — don't walk past one room to clear another.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm5," A partner or two in hallways with doors and T-intersections would be very appreciated as, at some point, you will be forced to turn your back on an area you have not yet cleared. You, however, as a private citizen, will likely have to clear it alone. Therefore, you must keep your eyes and ears open and balance multiple danger problems to keep your risk at a minimum. Don't be fooled though, this process, and the other processes in this article, all pose very high risk., Never make your way down the middle of a hallway. At the same time, keep from touching the walls. Hallways are similar to doorways, meaning that they are a narrow passage that an intruder may be expecting you to come through. The middle of the hallway is your fatal funnel.

, Be aware, however, that stopping in a hallway to clear a room means that you have not cleared the rest of the hallway, and an unexplored (uncleared) area is now at your back.


Corners are no different, but what happens if there are two corners in two directions? This is a T-intersection. See the next section for more detailed information on how to clear a T-intersection.

, The areas you have not cleared still contain danger points and you should be splitting some of your attention toward the uncleared areas.

, Doing this means that you now have a room at your back that is uncleared, a hallway in front of you which is uncleared and the room you are intending you enter is also uncleared. This presents an overwhelming amount of danger zones. Placing yourself in this situation is unjustifiably dangerous.

"
"
Know what makes T-intersections especially dangerous.,
Start on the right side of the hallway when approaching a T-intersections.,
Keep an eye on the right corner as you make your way toward it.,
Clear the left corner as you would any corner, but do not place any part of your body past where the wall ends.,
Step back and to the left once you've gotten a view of the left corner.

,
Clear the right corner the same way you did the left corner.

,
Decide to enter.,
Proceed in a fashion similar to a door.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm6," T-intersections are where two hallways intersect and there are two separate corners to clear, neither of which grants better cover than the other. You essentially have double the space to clear, and several blind-spots further down either side of the uncleared hallway.

, The reasons behind this will be explained in detail later. The number one rule here is to not break the plane created by the intersecting hallway. Still, you want to see as much as you can before you commit to entering the hallway.

, Make sure nothing is an immediate danger.

, Again, crossing the plane created by the intersecting hallway telegraphs your presence to a possible intruder.

,,, Now that you have cleared as much as you can without crossing the line, you must break through the plane.


Enter to the right. The reason the order of the side is important is because you can turn faster toward your support side than your firing side. If someone ends up being in the corner to your left, you can, more quickly, spin to your left than your right. This is all assuming you are right-handed. Everything should be flipped if you are left handed.

, Go through diagonally, spotting the corner you are heading toward, and a look over your shoulder to the other corner. View the images to the right for visual representations.

Approach the stairs as if it were a hallway.,
Stay on one side of the stairs, just as in a hallway.,
Look above you before you take too many steps (going up stairs).,
Watch any exposed areas that may present themselves.",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm7," There will probably be a corner clearing before you get to the stairs. Clear as much of the stair as you can without getting onto them. Stairs create a problem when clearing a building alone, but seeing as a good portion of residential buildings contain stairs, they may need to be traversed at some point.


The problem with stairs is that in the best situation, they have the same properties as a hallway. In the worst situation, they are a hallway with a T-intersection, and they may have a landing or two with corners and possibly an overlook onto the stairs. All of this means that there are many danger-points simultaneously, only one of which can be covered at any one time. Stairs are dynamic, and some adaptation may be required to match the stair you may be on.

, If there is a corner or other type of twist in the stairs, you want to be on the opposite side as the corner.

, See if there is an overlook onto the stairs. If there is you will want to clear that as you walk up the stairs.


Keep in mind any corners that are ahead also. Do not neglect these; as said before, there are multiple directions that will need your attention; a partner could easily cover the overlook, while you clear the corner.

, Many stairs with switchbacks expose your legs before you can see around the corner. Move your body to allow yourself the best possible view of areas you are unable to see.


Some stairs in apartments or other buildings don't have covered rises in the stairs. This is a great way for someone hiding under the stairs to get cover and attack you while you are unable to do anything back.
The best thing you can do is practice this with a friend using a flashlight.

You should decide ahead of time (even before you own a firearm for personal defense) what your personal morals will allow you to do in this and other situations. Read some information on tactical mindsets if you need help deciding.

, You need to give fair warning before shooting. If you have identified the intruder, and they have already tried to harm you, you may not need to provide additional warning.


Keep in mind there may be more than one adversary in the house; additionally, being shot is not synonymous with dying, so keep yourself behind cover as much as possible.

, Chances are you are unsure of who your adversary is or do not know his intentions. (Realize an intruder may mask their intentions — and someone who broke into your house is probably not there to borrow sugar.) Present yourself, by surprise if possible, and order the target with short, firm phrases. Once you have gotten your targets attention with ""STOP!"" ""Hands in the air!"" try directing the intruder by saying ""Face away from me!"" and ""Get on your knees!""


Having him face away from you and keeping him on his knees prevents him from retaliating against you, and keeps him from moving anywhere quickly without a good deal of movement.
If he has a firearm in his hand, be sure to tell him to drop it! If he does not comply immediately, he is only contemplating the best way to shoot you with it. Re-emphasize the point with ""...else I will shoot you!"", then take appropriate action. If he decides to slowly set it down, tell him to ""STOP!"" and ""DROP IT!"" There have been many police shootings which involved a person slowly setting down a gun, then changing their mind and shooting the police instead. It will take at least 1/8th of a second from the time they start to bring up their firearm until your brain can react. This is plenty of time for them to fire before you know what is going on.

, Do the right thing and eliminate the threat. Hesitating will not save your life. You'll only have the luxury of defending your actions if you're physically there to testify. A breach of your property rights must be met with swift action.


You may want to consider also carrying either pepper spray or a taser for these situations. It will be much easier to defend your decision to spray or taser an intruder who is simply belligerent than it would be to defend shooting a belligerent intruder.

, Since you have already called the police, or have a cell phone on you, the police should not be too far behind.


If for some reason you do not have a cell phone on you, you did not already call the police, and a phone is not within visual range of the intruder, you can have him move while on his knees, be sure he doesn't turn to face you.

, Place yourself in a location of cover and be sure he doesn't have any buddies that may come around a corner. You have announced your presence to the whole house, so another adversary in the house will know exactly where you are, but you can't risk leaving the man you have left alone or out of sight.

, Again, this includes any small area where a miss on one man may be a hit on the other. Multiple targets add a great deal of complexity to a situation, but the truth is that most criminals do not work alone.


Telling multiple adversaries to ""STOP!"" is a bad idea. By the time you are able to engage one for not complying, the other could have attacked you. Try to decide ahead of time in your mind what you will do if you encounter multiple adversaries.

Remove light from the equation, if possible, for an advantage.,
Keep a hand-held flashlight next to your weapon of choice.,
Consider outfitting your firearm with various sights.,
Allow your eyes to adjust.,
Be aware of your surroundings.,
Identify a possible target and temporarily blind him by flashing your light at their eyes in order to disorient them.,
Get a good look at the intruder and with a bright enough light, the light-splash should allow you to see if he is holding a weapon.,
Engage the target as described above.

",How to Clear a Building with a Firearm9," Most situations which would have you creeping around your own house will likely happen at night. It is recommended that you keep the area as dark as possible as you clear your house. Darkness gives you a few advantages: You surely know your house better than an intruder, and if you have a flashlight with you, you have the ability to completely remove the intruder's night vision.

, There is also the option to have an additional attached flashlight. Most tactical, or combat, weapons have the ability to attach certain lights to the frame of the firearm.


Hand-held light gives you options that the attached light does not, so while an attached light is a great feature to have on a weapon, it cannot always replace the hand-held light.

, Night sights are a welcome feature because they allow you to line up your sights when there is no light. This isn't a panacea, however: If you can't see your sights you may not be able to see your target, and you will have an even more difficult time identifying your target. (Make sure you're not dealing with your next-door-neighbor's son!)


Laser sights are also options. Laser sights will allow you to see where your firearm is pointed without having to use the sights to aim. This can be very helpful if you don't have your corrective lenses in. As always, you must identify your target as hostile before firing, which means that you will want to have a flashlight, even if you are using a laser.

, Your best ""accessory"" is your own body. If something happens while you are sleeping, your eyes are already adjusted, but if something happens and you are around light (but you must go into a dark area) be sure you let your eyes adjust before you proceed. It can take up to 30 minutes for your eyes to fully adjust.

, You do not want to be silhouetted against the light behind you, or highlighted by light on you. Try to approach danger areas from the shadows or from behind other areas of concealment or cover.

, Aim the light right at the head and turn it on for only a moment (a flashlight with a temporary-on switch is preferable). You need a flashlight with at least 50 Lumens to temporarily disorient an attacker at night.

, This action will also get a reaction which will give you an idea into the intruder's head. They now know you know where they are, and being blinded is not a comfortable situation. The chemicals in his eyes which allow humans to see in almost complete darkness will have been burnt away and will take up to 30 minutes to fully return, which gives you a big advantage.

Local emergency managers and the American Red Cross can help you determine the risks in your area.;
, http://www.ready.gov is a place to start with a plan template in the ""Are You Ready"" book. Make your plan based on the hazards, ex. tsunami is not likely in Oklahoma while localized flash flood may occur.

, Sirens are out-of-door warnings only. Get text alerts on your cell phone and email on your computer. Many local governments are offering these for free. Have a battery powered AM/FM radio with extra batteries.

, This is the concept behind Safe and Well from the American Red Cross <https: safeandwell.communityos.org="""" cms="""" index.php="""">

,,, Go to the local home supply store and get 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets with the snap-on lids.

,, Be sure to pack long and short sleeve shirts, a pair of shorts, a pair of jeans, good walking shoes and socks, and a wind-breaker rain jacket. Additional items can be added/removed according to the season and type of potential disaster in your area, such as thermal underwear, sleeveless shirts, or water/canoeing shoes (shoes that make it easier to walk in water).

, Be sure to pack enough water.

,, Consider purchasing solar or crank rechargeable lights and radios, and maybe some glow sticks. Candles should never be used. Stationary flashlights of the highway safety type should be used for temporary lighting.

, Flashlights with multiple LEDs have proven to be the most reliable lamps by comparison to conventional lamps. LED lights last a long time on batteries, and a headlamp leaves both of your hands free to cook, do dishes, read, or many other things.

, Keep a carbon filter water pitcher in the refrigerator, and several fresh filter inserts standing by. This does not replace boiling water, as it is intended to be an after boil filter. Also, in the house kit, make sure you have ""shelter in place"" items, ex. duct tape, plastic sheeting material for windows and the knowledge of how and when to use them.

, Water can be contaminated, so you need to store enough water for drinking, and additional water for cooking (if you have a camp stove), flushing a commode, and washing. A reflector oven would be a good investment. They are available at any good camping store.

, In case of emergency, you can grab the box and go, or it can be recovered intact later.

, Keep the list with your other disaster kit items.

,, If you're in a tornado-threatened area, and on a higher level if you are concerned about flooding or earthquakes, and you can reasonably plan on surviving on site, put your kit in an upper level closet.

, You can prepare kits for your pets too! Be sure to include, a package of food, water, and anything else your pet would need in a safe, accessible place. Keep them all in a suitable pet-carrier so that you can grab on the fly.

, Looters often take advantage of overtaxed emergency services.

, Make sure to have cash in small bills such as ones, fives and tens. This is crucial in case ATM machines are disabled and banks are closed. Also, many convenience stores do not accept large bills.

, Do you have a way to call your out of State contact to let them know you are OK? Did it work? Did you practice evacuating? What were some hiccups? Did you practice a fire evacuation at three in the morning? Did everyone get out OK? Did you meet at the right spot?

Finish constructing your entrance tunnel and backfilling the excavation.",How to Build a Bomb Shelter," To be successful on this project (where failure could, one might assume, leave you dead) requires a thorough survey of the site you choose. Here are some explanations why this is critical to success.

Bomb shelters must be able to sustain minimal damage in a near miss or direct hit from exploding ordinance.  Soft soil can offer only limited resistance to bomb energy, so building in soft soil requires a deep excavation with highly reinforced construction. In areas with poor drainage or a high water table, the option of building deep will require more engineering than this page will offer.
Building in solid rock, unless you have a suitable cavern to use as a superstructure, will require blasting and drilling, which also will exceed the scope of this page.
Building into the side of a mountain or steep hill is a good choice for people with the resources to do so, and without the depth requirements, the following steps are fairly typical of what needs to be done to successfully complete your bomb shelter project.
Building on stable, flat, well-drained land is the most direct approach to getting the job done, and that will be what we assume the reader plans to do.;
, Basically, there are four things to keep in mind while designing your shelter.

How many people will it house? This will give you information needed to design the shelter in respect to size and accommodation. Since bomb shelters typical are very temporary in nature unless a sustained bombardment is anticipated, you can expect to allow at least 72 square feet of space per person.
Decide what ordinance your structure will need to resist. A typical 500 pound bomb has a blast energy of about 10,000 feet per second using high explosives, and if fused for a ground burst or impact detonation, you will want a minimum of 15 feet of energy absorbing material between the ground and your structural roof.  Bunker busters, on the other hand, can penetrate many feet (the exact distance, for obvious reasons, is classified), of reinforced concrete.  Since 20 feet is a reasonable limit to excavate and redress, we will assume our design on that depth, other considerations are best left to experts.

,  With an excavation this deep, shoring, sheet pilings, and other issues will require professional assistance, so the following construction steps are general requirements for minimal performance., If you are knowledgeable about concrete construction methods including load bearing cast in place concrete beams, roofs, and walls, you could do this yourself, however getting an expert is recommended, Most likely, you will need engineered plans and a geotechnical report before a permit will be issued.  Now that the technical issues have been addressed, look further down for actual building instructions.,,  For a 12X18 foot shelter, you will want to clear about one acre of land for ancillary use., Trying to dig a very deep hole on unlevel land is an invitation to disaster., This is to allow an access ramp to be created, and will give workment/equipment access in later steps. Continue to build your ramp until you are below the finish floor grade of your shelter., You may use a load for this purpose, but a large excavator, in the 300 to 350 range and with an extended reach boom will give faster and more efficient production., Working in the bottom of a deep pit without cave in protection is illegal and foolish. When unstable soil is encountered, either use shoring systems or sheet piling to protect the workers., You may now want to rough in whatever utilities your shelter will require, such as electrical power, plumbing, and a fresh air supply duct, since these may be installed underneath your shelter foundation.,  Since the main structural element of the shelter will be the walls and especially the roof, you will not need an very thick floor, but the exterior walls will require a substantial foundation. This can be placed in a monolithic slab, making the floor itself about 8 inches thick, and the wall foundations about 3 feet thick and 5 feet wide., Number 5 rebar on 8 inch centers, the wall footings will need something like 8 number 8 rebar, 4 top and bottom supported by number 4 rebar stirrups on 24 inch centers. You will also want to provide 2 rows of dowels made from number 8 rebar on 12 inch centers spaced 10 inches apart. These will require a minimum of 30 inches embedment and 6 feet of projection. Keep in mind these are general design requirements, if your structural engineer requires more or different configurations, he is the expert., Your bomb shelter should be protected by a blast resistant, reinforced concrete and steel laminated structural door and frame. Consulting a vault door manufacturer like Mosler is probably a good idea., You will almost certainly require an aerial concrete pump for this part of the project, choose one with sufficient boom and capacity to reach all sides of the slab without getting too near the excavation. These special vehicles can have booms from 30 to 40 meters long, and a pump hose 6 inches in diameter., You may use coil rods, snap ties, or other means to secure the forms, along with whalers, stiff backs, and other shoring to keep your walls plumb and uniform in thickness. You will want to go ahead and erect the inside forms to the finished ceiling height of the bomb shelter. Generally, a minimum of 7 foot is required, but 8 foot ceilings are considered standard., The sides will be reinforced with number 8 rebar on twelve inch centers vertically (two rows), and number 6 rebar horizontal at 12 inch maximum centers on each row of vertical bars. Make sure to use corner bar reinforcement at all corners, and lap bars at splices a minimum of 48 bar diameters.,, The tensile strength of the concrete is up to you or a structural engineer, but 4000 psi concrete is recommended. The exterior forms should extend higher than the interior ceiling so they will act as a perimeter form for placing the concrete roof on your bunker.  Depending on the blast energy calculation you made earlier, decide on the thickness of the bunker roof.  Since it will support the weight of tons of earth as well as resisting the bomb blast, a minimum thickness of 2 feet is suggested., A minimum to two mats of number 8 rebar at 10 inches on center is needed, for roof spans greater than 16 feet, increase the rebar size, decrease the spacing, and thicken the roof unless steel support beams and columns are used to offset the increase load. You may also consider pouring lateral concrete support beams (and even using high tensile pre-stressed concrete slabs for the roof, if it is in your budget)., Make sure the concrete is slumped correctly and that you vibrate it to consolidate the materials while pouring. Using the services of a testing laboratory will help ensure the concrete reaches its required strength., You will want to leave the outside forms in place until the roof has been cast in place., You may choose to rent metal shoring systems from a form company, but you will need to install a minimum of one 4X4 tee jack at 32 inch cents both ways with the top of the tee 1 inch below the form joist bottoms. Assuming you are using 2X6 pine joists for your form, and the ceiling is 8 feet high, your tee jacks will be 7 feet 5 inches tall.  Install diagonal bracing to keep your tee jacks plumb and in line. For the uninitiated, a tee jack is a vertical post built from a 4X4 with a horizontal Tee on top, also usually a 4X4., After your tee jacks are in place, lay out your joists on 12 to 16 inch centers, then deck the joists with either form panel metal sheeting (preferred) or a minimum 3/4 form ply sheeting., You will have two or three mats of rebar, minimum, so tie your first mat of number 8 rebar on ten inch centers supporting it on rebar chairs sold for this purpose, the support and tie of the second mat using standees to maintain the correct spacing between mats., As with the walls, higher strength concrete is required, with a minimum yield of 4000 psi, but a preferred design mix of 5000 psi or 850 flexural strength. Allow this concrete placement to cure for a minimum of 7 days before removing the shoring support system. After 28 days, the outside forms can be removed, and backfilling can commence., If you have installed an air supply duct underneath the slab, you can backfill to the top, otherwise, you will want to install this duct work when you reach the elevation required., Do not backfill the access ramp yet, as you will need to construct a tunnel entrance to allow access first., You will need to create a tunnel at least 50 feet long to reach the door of your bomb shelter. Depending on the size of your door, using a concrete pipe or structural tubing like asphalt coated galvanized steel pipe in 10 or 12 feet diameter is the most practical method. Since tunnel failure can turn your refuge into a tomb in short order, care in choosing and constructing your entrance venue is just as important as designing and building the shelter itself., Restore the vegetation over the top, connect the utilities and air supply ducts, and you are finished."

Usually areas close to water will be evacuated during severe storms, so you should find out if you area is one of these. That way, when severe storm warnings come in, you can be prepared to evacuate if necessary.Find out if there are any evacuation shelters near your home. Mark them on a map so you know where to go if you're forced to leave your home.
Also pay attention to the topography around your home. If you live at the bottom of a hill, water will flow down towards your house. This means that your property is flood-prone, and you should take extra precautions if a storm is approaching. Sand bags around your home, for instance, could help reduce the chances of flooding.
Locate high-ground in your neighborhood so you have a place to flee in case your home floods.;
, In the event of a severe storm, you could be cut off from food for a few days. If the area loses power, local supermarkets won't be able to open. To prepare, the CDC recommends that you stock your home with at least 3 to 5 days' worth of food and water per person.Get food that doesn't go bad, like canned items. This way if you lose power your food won't spoil. It is also helpful because you can buy non-perishable items at the beginning of the hurricane season and not worry about having to replace them until at least the next year.
Five gallons of water per person should be enough to last 3 to 5 days.

, In addition to food and water, the CDC checklist recommends several other items you should have in your home. They include, but are not limited to:Medical supplies like a first aid kit and any prescription medicines you are taking.
A battery-operated radio in case you lose power.
A flashlight.
Extra batteries for all your devices.
Extra blankets.
Personal care items like soap, toothpaste, and cleaning wipes in case you don't have access to water.
A fire extinguisher.

, It possible that you'll be ordered to evacuate your home, or be forced to leave in the event of sudden flooding. To prepare for this, you should also have supplies stocked for your car. The CDC recommends the following items to ensure your health and safety if you're forced to drive in the storm.Non-perishable food and water.
Emergency flares.
Jumper cables.
First-aid kit.
Blankets.
Flashlights and extra batteries.
A map. You could also mark evacuation shelters or other safe places you could go if forced to leave your home on this map.
A GPS navigator.

, In the event of a hurricane, it is very important for you and everyone in your house to have a plan of action. Review this plan periodically so everyone in your house if familiar with it. If you have children, it might be helpful to hold drills a few times a year so they can practice things like packing and getting into the car quickly. Some things you should include in your plan are:Decide at what point you will leave your home. Just because an area wasn't ordered to evacuate doesn't mean that you won't still have to leave your home. A serious storm can send surges of water that will flood homes far from the coast.
A list of locations you can stay if you're forced to leave your home.
How you'll communicate with other members of your family if you leave your home.
If you have pets, you need to plan what you will do with them if you're forced to leave your home.

, High winds from hurricanes can easily knock out power. If possible, you should install a generator in the event of a power loss. This will keep your food fresh, your home lit, and your telephones working.If your generator is gasoline-operated, be sure to keep an extra supply on hand.
If your generator isn't programmed to turn on automatically when the power goes out, make sure you put it in a location you can easily reach during the storm.
Never locate a generator indoors. Most run on gasoline, which produces carbon monoxide. If you run a generator indoors, you will poison yourself.

, If your home is damaged during the hurricane, you'll have to put in an insurance claim to recover your losses. Things will be much easier on you if you have a complete record of what your house looked like before the storm.

, Overgrown trees and shrubs have a large surface area that will catch a lot of wind when the storm starts. They could be uprooted or knocked over, which could cause damage to your home. Trimming them will make them more wind-resistant and reduce the chances that they will be uprooted., Standard homeowners insurance usually doesn't cover hurricane damage. Check your insurance plan and see if you're covered. If not, ask your insurance provider about getting a hurricane plan. Hurricanes are capable of severe damage, and without proper coverage you could end up with a significant financial loss., You might be ordered to evacuate suddenly if the storm is worse than expected. Watch TV, listen to the radio, or visit the National Weather Service site for up to date information on the storm., Even Category 1 hurricanes can bring winds of nearly 100mph, which can easily blow around anything you have outside that isn't securely tied down.Remove all hanging plants, furniture, barbeques, and anything else that could blow away. These items can smash into your property and cause damage, or strike cars and pedestrians and cause injury. Avoid this by moving them inside before the storm.

, If the area loses power, ATM's won't work and banks will be closed. Prepare for this by having cash on hand when the storm hits. Withdraw enough cash to get you through at least a few days, in case you don't have access to your bank.

, Even relatively mild hurricanes have powerful winds that can send items flying through your windows. In addition to the obvious property damage here, the flying glass could cause injury to you or your family. If a storm is expected to be severe enough, the National Weather Service will probably recommend you board up your windows. Listen to the most recent reports to find this out. To do so, use plywood boards and nail them over your windows.If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it would be better to install permanent storm shutters on your windows. This way when a storm is approaching you can simply flip them closed to protect your windows.

, It's possible that you'll have to leave your house at some point during or after the storm. In the event of a sudden evacuation, make sure your gas tank is full.It would also be a good idea to have a few emergency containers full of gas in addition to your car's tank. If the area loses power or stations sustain damage, gas may be unavailable for a few days after the storm. Make sure you have an extra supply of gas to get through this situation.
If you live in a hurricane-prone area, it is recommended that you always have your gas tank at or above 1/2 tank throughout the season to prepare for unexpected storms.

, In the event of flooding, you need to make sure your important documents like birth certificates, insurance papers, social security cards, etc. are protected. Store them in a waterproof box so they won't be damaged if your home floods.

, As the storm approaches, double check your emergency supply kit. Make sure you have everything on the CDC checklist and that none of your food has expired. If you need anything, go to the store as soon as possible- when the storm hits these locations might be closed., If authorities order an evacuation for your area, comply. These orders are issued based on expectations of the storm's severity. If you choose to remain behind, you put yourself and your family at risk. You also endanger any first responders who have to come rescue you if the situation gets dangerous. Review FEMA evacuation guidelines to prepare for this possibility.

, Keep the TV or radio on to get the most recent information. Local authorities may issue new orders as the storm progresses. If your power goes out, flip on your battery-operated radio., It is possible for water service to be interrupted during a hurricane. To avoid problems, fill the bathtub and several large buckets with water. That way, you'll be able to pour water down the toilet in the absence of flushing, and you'll be able to wash yourself., In the event of a power loss, all of the food in your refrigerator and freezer could go bad. Keeping these on the coldest setting will help keep your food cold for as long as possible if you do lose power. Open the doors as little as possible to trap the cold air inside.

, If you have a propane tank attached to your house, turn it off during the storm. Storm damage could sever a gas line, which causes an explosion or fire risk., Strong winds can send projectiles through windows and cause injury. If your windows aren't boarded up, stay away from them. It might be difficult to get medical attention during the storm, so avoiding injury is a top priority., The safest thing to do during a hurricane is stay indoors and wait the storm out. Whether you're at home or in an evacuation shelter, you should stay inside for the duration of the storm unless there is a serious emergency. Stay tuned in to news stations and wait until they have confirmed that the storm has passed before going outside.Beware of lulls. This could mean that the eye of the storm is passing. Winds will calm and the rain will probably stop if the eye is over your area. Don't be fooled. The storm will restart again without warning and you could be caught outside if you leave your home. Wait until local authorities have confirmed that the storm is over before leaving shelter.

, If your home has suffered damage, document it right away for insurance purposes. Take photos of anything that's been damaged in preparation for filing the insurance claim., Storm surges can flood water supplies with bacteria and garbage. Authorities have to investigate the water supply to ensure it's safe. Until that is confirmed, continue drinking the water you've stored in your home., Downed power lines and gas leaks are common after hurricanes. If you witness any damage or smell gas, call authorities right away so they can begin repairs.If you smell gas in your own home, call 911 and get out right away.

, Just because the storm is over doesn't mean it is safe to travel. There may be flooding, damaged trees, and electrical wires to worry about. It is best to stay indoors until the cleanup is complete. Only go out if you need supplies., If you've been evacuated, wait before returning to your home. Your area may have suffered extensive damage. Officials need to investigate for gas leaks, exposed electrical wires, and flooding. When they've investigated the area, they will give you the green light to go back home."

Consider other supplies you might need.",How to Build a Safe Room," Before building your safe room, you must take several factors into account to ensure that the safe room serves its purpose of protecting its occupants, and does not pose a hazard.


It is crucial that you start by reading the government manual available at www.fema.gov/pdf/plan/prevent/rms/453/fema453.pdf. This manual will provide design considerations, potential risks, structural design criteria, information about air filtration, and other considerations that will keep you and your family safe. If you do not read this manual, you risk designing a safe room that could put your family at risk through faulty design or construction.;
, The safe room's construction and design must be reinforced and built to withstand storms and threats of attack; be sure you understand these factors as you plan and build the safe room.


The room must be constructed out of material that can withstand high winds as well as heavy debris that may be flying around, for instance in a tornado situation. Concrete walls are a great choice, but if you want to adapt an existing wooden-walled room, you can reinforce the insides of the walls with steel sheathing.The room should not have windows, but if it does, they should be very small (too small for a burglar to crawl through) and constructed of Plexiglas to prevent shattering.The room must be anchored securely to ensure that it does not lift or overturn in high winds or a tornado.You will need to design the walls, door and ceiling to be able to stand up to high wind pressure, as well as resist penetration or crushing from flying or falling debris.You need to make sure that the spaces where the room is connected, like wall and ceiling joints, are designed to withstand wind. Additionally, the structure should be independent of surrounding rooms in your home or business, so that any damage done to the home will not affect the safe room.A below-ground safe room must be able to withstand flooding or water accumulation in the event of heavy rains.The door should open inwards, in the event that a storm piles debris outside the door. It should also be constructed of heavy material that cannot be kicked in by an intruder or blown in by a storm. Solid wood or metal doors are a good option; consider using an exterior heavy wooden door for an interior safe room, and reinforce the sides with metal for added security., The safest place for a safe room is underground; a first-floor interior room is also a good location.If you have a basement, this is the most ideal location for a safe room if you are concerned about tornadoes or other storms with high winds. It is the most secure location, away from exterior walls.The garage is also a great option, as it usually has quite a bit of space for construction and, provided you keep the garage tidy, less risk of falling debris during a storm., Depending on the number of people you need to accommodate, the available space you have to work in, and your budget, your choices might vary. The goal is to be safe; but some safe rooms may be more convenient or attractive than others.


A yard bunker safe room is designed to be dug into and installed underground. One outside door opens to above ground, and you can purchase units to fit any number of people. Steel or concrete is your best choice because fiberglass shelters run the risk of cracking.
Above-ground shelters can be attached to the outside of a home, or they can be situated within the interior. Some can be designed so that they are indiscernible to the untrained eye, and other rooms are large enough to accommodate many people (for example, at a school or church). These can be built or purchased prefabricated, which is slightly pricier but will ensure that they are built to code.
If you are in the construction phase of a new home or business, the safe room can be built into the plans as an additional room in the building.

, Before beginning construction, its important to create accurate plans that are designed to government specifications. This will ensure that your safe room can live up to its name.


You can obtain free safe room construction plans and specifics at https://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/2009. You can use these to design your own safe room or work with a contractor on its construction.
Purchase code guidelines to help you plan to build your storm safe room to code. You can purchase ICC 500: 2008 Standard for the Design and Construction of Storm Shelters in a downloadable format at http://shop.iccsafe.org/icc-500-2008-icc-nssa-standard-for-the-design-and-construction-of-storm-shelters-2.html. These guidelines are written by the International Code Council, which sets code standards worldwide.

, Depending on the plan you follow, you will need various supplies potentially including concrete, steel bars, a heavy wooden door, and deadbolts.


Consider using anchors that are power driven around the unit's wall perimeter to avoid horizontal movement.
To avoid vertical movement, look into Simpson Strong Tie anchors.
Be sure to follow the FEMA guidelines for securing your ceiling and wall to the bottom plate of the structure.
Install two layers of plywood around the room interior. A layer of steel or kevlar can be considered behind the plywood layer.
Install a door with a 2-inch (5.08 cm) dead bolt lock.

, Retrofitting an existing room in your home or business is the cheapest and simplest way to protect your loved ones from storms or intruders. While building or installing a prefabricated safe room can cost between $2500-$6000, you can retrofit an existing room for a thousand or less.


Choose a room that is in the interior of the house with no windows or skylight, and no walls shared with the outdoors A large walk-in closet works well., A safe room needs a door that can withstand high winds or being kicked in by an intruder, and should ideally open inwards rather than outwards in case debris is stacked outside the room during a storm.


Remove the existing door and doorjamb. Replace the doorjamb with a steel one, and reinforce the surrounding wood with steel angle iron (which will prevent the door from being kicked or blown in).Replace the door with a heavy, solid wood door (such as one sold as an exterior front door for a home) or with a heavy steel door. Mount it so that it opens inwards rather than out., You can choose if you want to use a traditional deadbolt or a keyless deadbolt. The keyless deadbolt has the advantage that you don't have to find the key in case of emergency, but can be dangerous if you have small children in your household who may lock themselves inside.Before installing the new locks and doorknob, reinforce the wood around them by installing steel or brass strike plates, which you can purchase at most hardware stores.Install the locks so that the door locks from the inside. If its a traditional deadbolt, be sure to make a copy of the key and keep the keys in two separate but easily accessible locations, where you can find them immediately in case of emergency.

, If you are adding the safe room to new construction, you can reinforce the walls and ceiling with concrete, chicken wire, or steel sheeting before adding dry wall and paint to the walls. If not, you will need to tear out the existing dry wall to reinforce the walls.


The most cost-effective way to reinforce the walls is by pouring concrete into the cavity between the 2x4s in the walls. Then, screw plywood or 1-1/8″ oriented strand board to the 2x4s on either side. You can then cover this with drywall and paint.You can also screw steel sheeting to the 2x4s and cover with drywall and paint. You will need to use steel sheeting or chicken wire in the ceiling, which can be done from the attic if you're in a one-story home, or applied directly to the ceiling (less attractive, but chances are good no one will be looking at the ceiling of your closet safe room).

, If you want to create a more complicated or stand-alone structure, its important that it is up to code. If you don't have a lot of experience with construction, you can contact a contractor or local storm shelter company for help planning and installing your project.


Ask around for recommendations of local contractors. Ask family or friends who have recently remodeled or done construction work, or contact the National Association of the Remodeling Industry or a local building inspector, who will be able to point you in the right direction., A basic safe room will keep your family safe, but if you want to add additional features for a more high-end safe room (particularly for a very expensive home that is at risk of burglary), you have several options:


A camera monitoring system. A high end security system, installed by professionals, can allow you to monitor your home from the inside of the safe room in the event of a home invasion.A keypad entry. A keypad can allow you to lock the door to the safe room instantly in the event of a home invasion, instead of wasting precious time locking deadbolts., In the event of a storm or terrorist attack, you may have to stay in the safe room longer than expected. Its important to be prepared with essentials for your family, as well as any unexpected guests who may have to share your safe space.


Start with a minimum of three gallons of water per person that fits in the occupancy of the room.Its easy to see how supplies can quickly fill up the safe room space: if you have a safe room that accommodates five people, you'll need fifteen gallons of water.
Store nonperishable food items in the safe room, such as cans of beans or ready-to-eat soup (don't forget a can opener), boxes of cookies or crackers, granola or protein bars, and cans of infant formula or powdered milk.
While its a good idea to plan for a three day stay in the shelter, if you have enough space its a good idea to store more. In the off chance that a hurricane or tornado could wipe out the neighborhood, you might need more supplies to help support your neighbors until help arrives.
Remember to periodically rotate your supplies so that nothing expires or goes rancid (yes, even nonperishable foods expire eventually!).

, In the event of a storm, you may need other supplies to support you and your family until the storm is over or until help arrives.


You will need a battery operated radio, at least one large flashlight, and several extra batteries.Consider a change of clothing and blankets for each member of your family.
Be sure to pack a well-stocked first aid kit, complete with any medications that your family members take regularly as well as bandages, antibiotic ointment, small scissors, gauze wrap, and ibuprofen.
Stock the safe room with several rolls of duct tape and plastic sheeting, for sealing doors and covering ventilation in the event of nuclear or chemical warfare."
"
Understand that there is nobody to blame when nature vents her fury.,
Minimize your media intake.,
Find ways to act constructively.,
Be a donor.,
Check out Facebook groups.,
Stay in touch with people you know in the disaster area.,
Rediscover your sense of humor.",How to Cope With Survivor's Guilt Following a Natural Disaster," Accepting this is essential because it allows you to see that everyone feels powerless when a terrible natural disaster event occurs that harms and kills many people. Nobody could have stopped it and nobody is at fault. Sure, there will always be things that could have been done better, from improving building codes to giving out more warnings, but the actual event itself will always stem from something over which human beings have little control.;
, If you find yourself getting really upset by all the images, to the point of not being able to function for crying and feeling upset, you're no good to anybody and it's a pointless way to honor those who have lost their lives and livelihoods. Instead, take a break until you feel a bit better (perhaps an early night will right things) and then be very careful about how much you take on board until your emotional strength returns.

, From helplessness, turn to doing constructive activities that can help the victims. Whether you have suffered damage yourself but have survived the event intact or whether you're someone who lives nearby or you're someone who has read about it all unfolding online, feeling that you can help is an important part of minimizing survivor's guilt. Some of the constructive things you can do include:


If you have skills or knowledge that can directly assist those in need, offer your time. If you have medical, organizational, cooking, first aid, rescue, legal, accounting, animal welfare, counseling, child-minding, plumbing, electrical, building, etc., skills, all of these and more can help people in need. Sometimes volunteer groups get together, such as the Christchurch student volunteer army, and you can join these groups and give your time and raw skills (such as shoveling mud and shifting debris) for a set time.






If you can, offer a room in your home for people without a home anymore. What more generosity could you provide than to shelter people who have lost everything? Be aware it has the potential to turn your life upside down but given that the lives of those you're offering to shelter have already been turned upside down, it's just one of those things to come to terms with. And don't forget about the special needs of elderly people who will find it very hard to get their lives back in order again. Another way to help is to offer your care or even shelter for pets or farm animals in need if you have the space and expertise.






Sharing information around for survivors to learn where they can find water, shelter, medical information, places for their pets to go, food sources, etc.







, In a disaster situation, money is the best possible thing you can donate in our current times. Money enables people to purchase exactly what is needed rather than being confronted by well-meaning by unhelpful donations of items. Give money, as much as you can afford to give, knowing that every cent or penny is making a huge difference when pooled together with everyone else's donations.


If you want to give things, wait until lists are published by aid organizations and governments that clarify exactly what is needed. Otherwise, you risk holding up rescue operations by sending unnecessary items.







Donate blood but only if it is called for. While it may seem like the first thing to do, if blood supplies are already well-stocked, your donation may not be needed and may divert health worker resources unnecessarily. If a call is put out, by all means donate but be sure it's not adding to the burden first.







, One of the things that is becoming increasingly obvious in recent disasters is the use of Facebook for leaving messages of condolences, support, and friendship. People are reaching out to one another across countries to send their wishes and courage to others and to let them know that they're not alone. If this is the only thing you can afford to do, at the very least donate your goodwill and love to people who need it.


You will probably find lots of Facebook groups set up for any particular disaster. Select the ones that seem to resonate best with you and are expressing your heartfelt concerns and what you wish to get across. You might even consider starting one of your own if you're willing to keep tending it.







, Even if you cannot physically help them, you can help them emotionally through talking to them by phone, emailing them, and sending them anything they might need. Let them know how much you love and care about them and that there is always a bed at your house if it gets too much for them and they need to get out of their ravaged environs.


For anyone who experienced the disaster first-hand, including yourself if relevant, ""getting over"" it takes a very long time. Being supportive of others through messages of love and concern will be need to be an ongoing activity, and compassion has no limits.






Realize that staying in touch can be hampered by phone lines being down and electricity cuts. Be patient and persistent.







, While natural disasters are terrible events and are not a joke in themselves, many survivors find strength in joking about the manner in which they're coping. After all, having to dig pit toilets in your backyard because the plumbing and electricity no longer work is either something you can cry about or laugh about and the laughter will raise your spirits more.


If you're not in the disaster yourself, recognize the sense of humor of survivors as a coping mechanism, not a form of belittling the event and support their endeavors to stay strong through humor.

Determine the danger.,
Call the emergency services.,
Open doors and windows.,
If you know how, turn the gas supply off at the meter or mains box.

,
Check the stove burners.,
Check the oven.,
Check the clothes dryer.,
Check to see whether the pilot light on your boiler has gone out.,
Contact the gas company.,
Get the leak repaired.",How to Act When You Find Gas Leaking in the Kitchen (USA)," The safety of people is always the first thing to consider, so heed the following first of all:


If it is difficult to breathe or the smell is very strong or you can hear a loud sound of escaping gas leave the kitchen immediately and get any other people out of the building.
Do not turn on light switches in or around the kitchen. Do not turn any electrical switches on or off, including doorbells.
Do not use matches or any other naked flames.
Do not use the bathroom as this triggers more gas.
Do not smoke.;
, Use a neighbor's telephone for emergency help. Do not call from within your house and never use a cell phone or portable phone within the house if you suspect a gas leak. If you need to use a cell phone, go to the neighbor's house to use it.

, Do this only if you can breathe easily and the smell of gas is not overpowering and you cannot hear a loud sound of escaping gas.

,, If you can breathe easily and the smell of gas is not overpowering and you cannot hear a loud sound of escaping gas, check the stove for burners that are on but not burning. The knobs should all be in the same position (off). Turn all knobs to off.

, Look for an oven control knob. It should be in the off position. Turn the control knob to off. On a modern oven the control may be electronic. Pressing the off or cancel button will turn off the gas.

, Some clothes dryers are gas operated. If this is the case, turn the dryer control knob to off or press the off button. If it is not clear that the dryer is operated by gas, do not operate the controls.

, This can be a common cause of a gas odor.

, Most all propane and natural gas supply companies will come to a residence and test for gas leaks. They will not perform the repair but they will identify the source of the gas leak.

, Gas leaks, even very small gas leaks, will not fix themselves. Always contact the gas company for help in locating the leak and use an experienced repair person to repair the leak.

Use the inside tube from an empty roll of toilet paper, holiday wrapping paper, plastic wrap, or any cardboard tube that is large enough in diameter and flexible enough so you can bend it to the shape of the electric eye.,
Cut the tube to be at least 2–4 inches (5.1–10.2 cm) long.,
Squeeze the tube so it makes an oval shape instead of it's normal round shape and slip it over the body of the electric eye unit so it extends about 2–3 inches (5.1–7.6 cm) past the end of the electric eye.

,Put a tube on the electric eye on each side of the garage door (one side for mornings, the other side for evenings)

,
Make sure the tube is extending straight out from the electric eye.,
Once you've determined the proper length of tube to block the sun from the electric eye you may want to go to a hardware store and invest in some plastic or rubber tubing that would be more durable and weatherproof for those rainy or snowy days.

",How to Shut a Garage Door when the Sun Is Shining on the Electronic Eyes," You may have to experiment with several size tubes until you find one that fits snug enough so it won't fall off.;
, Remember, if it's too long you can always cut it shorter. Once you cut it, you can't make it longer.

Criminals usually case a neighborhood before committing a crime, so they will know when you leave for work. Watchful neighbors who are home while you are at work make you much less likely to be robbed., A dog is a big responsibility, but they are very effective at deterring burglars. You want to keep burglars out, so bark matters more than bite. A small yappy dog is a more effective deterrent than a large quiet one., Don’t make it easy on thieves. An open door or window – even if it’s only while you are walking the dog – makes your home an easy target. Get in the habit of locking every door and window when leaving, after entering and before bedtime.And don’t forget to secure your dog or cat door., The only thing worse than leaving your door unlocked is letting a criminal have the keys.


Don’t keep a hidden key outside your house. Thieves know the most likely hiding places, so whether it is under a mat, in a flowerpot, or hidden in a fake rock, they will probably find it. Instead, give a spare key to your neighbor.Don’t carry house keys on a key ring bearing your home address or leave house keys with your car in a commercial parking lot or with an attendant., Even if you don’t really have security or a dog, a sign can be an effective deterrent., Criminals case neighborhoods. If they can see valuables – or even if you just look much richer than your neighbors – they are more likely to target you.


Draw blinds and shut curtains to keep items out of view and prevent criminals from “window shopping.”If you have a fancy car, keep it in the garage.Don’t advertise new purchases by leaving boxes on the curb. Put them in your recycling bin. Or break the boxes down and fold them inside out, then put them out just before the pickup time., Plumbing or home improvement projects give workers ample time to case your home; information they might pass on to criminals. Be sure to ask potential contractors if their employees are subject to criminal background checks., Criminals want to get in and out of homes as quickly as possible. Make it difficult on them by hiding or securing valuables.


Consider buying a small safe that bolts to the floor.Rent a safe-deposit box for extra-valuable items.
Keep car keys and garage remotes hidden.Stash jewelry or cash in places where thieves are unlikely to look:Use old, cleaned out shampoo, conditioner or moisturizer bottles.
Use an old spice jar. Paint the inside with glue and add herbs so it looks full. Then put cash in a plastic bag, insert in the jar and keep with your other spices.
Hide valuables in a full feminine napkin or tampon box.
Make a slit in a tennis ball, squeeze to open, and hide valuables inside



, If they are stolen, this will make it much more likely that you can recover them.Engrave jewelry with your name or a number and take a photo of it. This will make it more difficult to sell and aid in catching the thief.Make sure you record the serial numbers for your smart phones, computers, televisions, and other expensive electronics, as this will make them easier to track.Register your bicycle by serial number in the National Bicycle Registry., You can make an appointment for local police to inspect your home and suggest security fixes. This is a good way to decide what you should prioritize in protecting your home., Most insurance companies provide 2 percent to 15 percent discounts for devices that make a home safer—dead-bolt locks, window grates, bars and smoke/fire/burglar alarms., The back door is the most common point of entry for thieves,and the most common method is to simply kick it in.Outside doors should be metal or solid hardwood and at least 1.75 inches thick.
Be sure the frames are of equally strong material, and the door fits its frame securely so it cannot be pried open.Make sure the hinges are on the inside. Inexperienced door installers sometimes leave them on the outside, making it easy to simply remove the door.If there is a window near the door, put a ¼ inch covering of clear Plexiglas over the existing glass to prevent thieves from breaking the glass and reaching in to open the door.If you have an automatic opening garage door, make sure it can’t be lifted open when closed.

, These are often a point of entry for burglars, as the latch that closes them is easily forced.


Place a wood dowel cut to size or an adjustable safety bar in the interior floor track to keep the door from opening.Be sure to use shatterproof glass. If your glass is not, cover it with a thin film of plexiglass to prevent shattering.

, Locks are the weakest point on a door. Make sure you have a grade 1 or grade 2 dead-bolt lock that penetrates the door frame. The strike plate—the stationary piece that the bolt enters—should be made of solid metal or brass, with six three-inch-long screws that penetrate the door jamb and the door frame.For locks near windows, use a double cylinder deadbolt, which requires a key on the inside and outside. This prevents thieves from breaking the glass, reaching in and unlocking the door., Windows are another common entry point, particularly in the summer, when they are often left open.


Put locks on your windows. Key locks work best. Otherwise, criminals can simply break the glass and turn the lock.If you do wish to leave your windows open for ventilation, install a window stop that prevents the window from opening more than 6-8 inches.Use safety or shatterproof glass, to make breaking the windows more difficult.
For added security, consider putting bars or accordion gates on windows at street level or on fire escapes.Install a metal grate to protect basement windows, or put a metal bar in the middle to make sure they are too small to crawl through.
Secure window air conditioning units. Use a bracket or sliding window lock to prevent thieves from simply pushing in the unit and entering., No matter how secure you make them, windows are still made of glass. The best way to prevent entry by windows is to keep the thief from getting to the windows in the first place.


Don’t leave ladders out unsecured. Thieves can use them to reach second story windows.Consider installing plastic drainpipes, which are much harder to climb than metal ones.
Cut back weight-bearing tree limbs that hang near windows or over the roof.Place prickly bushes around first story windows to make them less tempting targets.

, Trim bushes and trees, particularly around doors and windows.Also, consider replacing privacy fences or thick shrubbery with something that can be seen through. A tall, solid fence also provides privacy for the burglar kicking in your back door., Motion sensitive lights are best. They startle criminals, and they also draw your attention and that of your neighbors. However, since nearly two thirds of burglaries occur during the day, lights should not be a top priority. Secure your windows and doors first., Alarm systems range from extremely complex and expensive for those that provide offsite monitoring and mobile access, to relatively cheap for door and window alarms you can install yourself. While more features might make your home marginally safer, know that merely having any sort of alarm system is usually enough to deter burglars.A monitored system will notify an offsite center if a break-in is detected. They will notify the police if they cannot contact you, or if they do contact you and you ask them to do so.A simple security system will set off a shrill alarm if a break-in is detected. This might scare off the burglar, or lead neighbors to call the police. However, know that police often charge a fee for a false alarm.Individual alarms for doors or windows or wireless cameras are relatively inexpensive and easy to install.

, There are a variety of choices to make when choosing a monitored service.Landline, Cellular, or Broadband Monitoring – Each option for how your system communicates with the monitoring center has advantages and disadvantages.

Landline – A landline phone connection is used to communicate with the monitoring center. It is the slowest option, and if you choose it, you should get cell uplink backup, or cutting the telephone lines will disable your system.
Cellular – A cellular uplink is used to communicate with the monitoring center. Cellular monitoring is faster and more reliable, but also more expensive.
Broadband – Your broadband internet is used to communicate with the monitoring center. It is much faster than a landline, and while not as reliable as cellular, it is cheaper.


Professional or DIY Installation – DIY is usually quite simple, and it means you own the equipment. It is good for renters or people who move a lot. Professional installation allows for more complex systems, but if you will be moving soon, be sure you go with a company that will move your system for free.
Home Automation – This provides the ability to remotely control not only your security settings, but also things like turning the lights on and off, and thermostat settings. It can also give you real time updates and let you know when your kids come home. It is convenient, but more expensive.

, These are the basics, whether using a monitoring service or not. There are many other features you can get – pressure mats under rugs to detect footsteps, closed circuit TV systems, broken glass sensors, or pressure sensors that detect when someone is trying to kick in a door – but motion detectors and magnetic door and window contacts are usually sufficient to detect a break in., Your security system won’t help if you forget to turn it on. It will be less effective if you don’t let burglars know it is there. Always follow these best practices:


Always use your system, even when you take a quick trip to the store, visit neighbors, or walk the dog around the block.Never post your pass code near the home security alarm keypad.Make sure the yard signs and window decals that say your home is protected by a security system are clearly visible.Use generic security signs. Knowing the security company can help thieves to disable the system., If you don’t want to invest in a full home security system, there are a number of simple, inexpensive alarms you can install yourself.


Doors – Doorknob alarms sound off loudly when they are moved. If someone tries to break in, they will emit a piercing sound just like an alarm system.
Windows – Similar movement-triggered alarms are available for windows. In addition, you can purchase inexpensive alarms that trigger when a window is broken.If you want to leave windows cracked for ventilation, window swags will sound if the window is opened too wide.Webcams – Motion-sensitive webcams start at $100 and can be remotely monitored on a Smartphone or computer. Twenty-four hour surveillance can help dissuade criminals from entering your home, and catch them if they do., Studies show that most criminals move on as soon as they see an alarm sign.So even if you don’t want to pay for an alarm system, be sure to invest in alarm signs.


Put signs in the front and rear of your house, as well as stickers in any windows you are worried about.
Adding fake motion sensors on your windows will make it even less likely that a burglar chooses your house.

, The key to protecting your home when you’re away on work or vacation is to trick burglars into thinking you are still there. Follow the steps below to do so.

, Timers cost $5 to $40. They can turn on and off your lights, or better yet your lights and television, at set times each morning and evening. Most burglars avoid occupied homes. If they think you are around, they’ll look elsewhere., Burglars sometimes call homes to be certain no one is there. If they here a phone go unanswered or an answering machine, they will know you are gone. Either turn down the volume on your ringer and answering machine or, better yet, have your calls forwarded., If you open and close them each day, consider using a timed, automatic curtain opener.If you are leaving your drapes open, be sure to move valuables so they are not in sight from the window.

, If your newspapers and mail start to pile up, criminals will know you’re not around.


It is best to have a neighbor pick up your mail, packages, and newspaper for you. Seeing deliveries will make criminals think someone is home.You can also have your mail forward or held by the post office.

, Arrange to have your lawn mowed in the summer, and your walk and driveway shoveled in the winter., Have a neighbor use your trashcan and put it out on the curb. A house with no trash cans in front on collection day signals burglars that you aren’t home., Tell a dependable neighbor or two when you plan to be away, and ask them to keep an eye on your house."

Buy a deadbolt for your door.,
If you have a spare key, be sure that it's well-hidden.,
Look for long rods that you can jam in-between your doorknob and floor below, thus preventing intruders from being able to open the door from the outside while in place.,
If you have sliding-glass doors, or windows that slide open, insert broom handles or long pieces of wood at the base of each door and window, along the track that your door or window slides on.,
Put a lamp or light on a timer, so that it turns on and off even when you are not home.,
Consider keeping weapons around your home, just in case you need to defend yourself.,
Put tape on your doors and windows.,
Buy small, screw-type locks for your sliding windows, in order to prevent intruders from opening your windows all the way.

,
Consider setting up some tripwires.,
Consider getting a guard dog or watchdog.,
If you are worried about somebody hopping over your back fence, buy some clear packing tape and a box of thumbtacks.",How to Safeguard a Home Without an Alarm," The more locks, the better!;
, Don't ""hide"" your spare key above the door-frame or under the doormat. Instead, put it someplace less obvious.

, These can be purchased, or you can make them yourself.

, This will make them impossible to open. Just hope they don't break the window.

, This will give a potential-intruder the impression that somebody is home. A burglar is less likely to enter a home if he or she thinks that there's a chance of being caught, arrested, or hurt in the process.

, Baseball bats and sharp sticks work well. Firearms work well, too, as they are effective even from a distance; but keep in mind that owning a firearm creates a whole new set of risks. Be sure that you know what you are doing if you opt to keep firearms around your house, and keep them well out of the way of young children.




Remember that even your own weapons can be taken from you, and used against you. Above all, be careful, and be sure that you receive proper training.



, This will alert you to whether or not anybody is opening your doors and windows without you knowing. If someone is periodically entering your home, there's a good chance that they'll attempt to do so again.

,, A tripwire is a string or fishing line, tied to a stick or a pole just above the ground, that causes a passerby to trip. These are often placed at the tops of staircases. Attaching noise-making devices (e.g. bells, chimes, etc.) to the tripwires will audibly warn you of intruders.

, Dogs are great pets, but they can also be great security systems.

, Tape the tacks onto the top of the fence, facing upwards. If an unsuspecting intruder grabs the top of the fence, he will get a handful of tacks. This will injure him, dissuade him from attempting to do the same thing again, and probably make him wonder what other sorts of booby traps you might have set up around your house.

Build a fence if you don’t have one.,
Add razor wire or barbed wire around the top of your fence.,
Install sheets of plywood behind the fence to strengthen it.,
Attach motion-activated lights to your house.,
Add a security system to your property.",How to Riot‐Proof Your Home1," If your house is easy to access from the street, it’s a likely target for rioters. A chain link or wood plank fence is a visual and physical deterrent. Having to climb a fence may be enough reason for potential looters to pass by your house.Building a fence all around your house is no small project. If you don’t have the time or knowledge, you may be better off hiring a contractor to build it.
Taller fences give you even more protection. A ten foot (3 m) fence is harder to climb than a five foot (1.5 m) fence.;
, If you already have a fence, or if you build one, putting wire around the top adds a second layer of defense. It looks scary and will make people not want to climb over. It also makes it harder to get across if rioters do climb the fence.It may be safer to hire someone to attach the razor wire or barbed wire, as it is very sharp. If you do it yourself, make sure you know what you’re doing and use caution.

, If you have a chain link fence, rioters could cut through it with bolt cutters. Putting sheets of wood up against the fence adds privacy and another layer of defense.Attach each piece of plywood to the fence at the corners of the board with a u-bolt and nuts. Drill holes for the bolts, and then screw the nuts on from inside the fence.

, One of the biggest things that makes your house a target is darkness. If you don’t have street lights or other security lights already, you need to add some. Lights around your house may be enough to scare people off.Motion-activated lights save energy because they aren’t always on, and you have the added benefit of startling trespassers.

, In the early stages of a riot, an alarm system that alerts the authorities of a break-in to your house is helpful. Research alarm systems to see what you could afford to have installed. Once you have it, put a sign out that says your property is monitored, which might keep people away."
"
Move expensive items away from the windows.,
Stick security film to your windows.,
Keep precut sheets of wood ready to attach to the windows.",How to Riot‐Proof Your Home2," Rioters look in windows for high-price items to loot. If you have a big TV and entertainment center right in front of your picture window, your house becomes a target. Move these items out of sight or hang some thick curtains.If people can’t see what you have, that may be enough to make them keep walking past your house.

, Since glass is so fragile, windows are the primary place for looters to enter your house. Attaching stickable security film to your windows keeps them from completely shattering if they are hit. Anything that slows rioters down is a good defense.The strong adhesive holds onto the glass shards, which makes it harder to climb in your windows.

, You may want to keep some security features on hand without actually installing them right away. Get plywood boards and cut them to fit all of your easily accessible windows. Keep them on hand for extreme situations.Store them in the shed so you can get to them and hang them up if you see unrest starting to build.
Keep a box of nails and a hammer close by the boards. Keep in mind that nailing wood to your house may damage the siding. You have to weigh the pros and cons of that type of security feature.

Replace your wooden door with a metal one.,
Install a deadbolt lock.,
Replace your basic strike plate with a stronger one.",How to Riot‐Proof Your Home3," Wooden doors are much more likely to break than metal doors if they get rammed or kicked. If it is in your budget, take your old wooden door out and replace it with a sturdy metal one. Metal doors are not usually solid, but are paneled with metal sheeting.Metal doors are heavier, which makes them harder to kick in. Metal also doesn’t splinter like wood does.

, When a door is kicked in, it often breaks past the strike plate, which is where the door latches. A deadbolt adds more resistance. If you don’t have much experience with this type of work, you may want to hire someone to install a deadbolt for you.It doesn’t hurt to have more than one deadbolt. Add a second one if you already have one.
Installing a deadbolt requires that you drill holes through the door. You’ll then attach part of the deadbolt to the front and back of the door. Carve a hole in the door frame and then screw the strike plate into the frame.

, Remove your old strike plate. Buy a heavy-duty steel strike plate at a hardware store. If the new strike plate is larger, be sure to chisel out a larger place on the door frame. Use three inch (7.6 cm) screws to secure the plate to the door frame.Your current strike plate probably does not have three inch (7.6 cm) screws, but using longer screws makes the strike plate stronger.

, You and your family have packed an emergency supply kit that will prepare you for any emergency. Now it's time to go over your list and make sure nothing was left out or forgotten.

, Well, now that your family has created an emergency supply kit, it's time to make a plan. It's important to plan ahead so that during an emergency you know what to do and how to get in touch with other family members! Here's how to create a clear family emergency plan.


Download a plan outline here:English or Español


, together for a quick family meeting, maybe over a pizza or before watching your favorite movie.

, Before you know it you will have a plan in place that everyone in your family can follow. And if an unexpected event does happen you can stay calm; listen to the direction of adults around you, like your teachers or parents and follow your plan.


If there were an emergency and we were not together in the same place ...

How would we get in touch with each other?

Decide that each member will call or e-mail the same person. For example, each person will contact Uncle Bob first. If he's not home, each person will contact Aunt Suzie instead.
If cell phones are not working, you should try using a land-line phone at a neighbor's or friend's house, or a public telephone. Everyone should have coins or a prepaid phone card to make the call.
It might be easier to reach a person who's out of town. You can contact him or her to let them know you're okay.



Where would we meet?

Choose an easy-to-find location near your home, then practice getting there from different locations around your neighborhood.
Also, choose an easy-to-find location outside of your neighborhood in case you can't get home. With your parents, practice getting to that location from school, sports practice, or other places where you have after-school activities.




How would we remain in contact?

You should keep a copy of your family's contact numbers and meeting place(s) taped to the inside of your binder or homework notebook, in your book bag, or your wallet. Your plan should include all the phone numbers you might need.
Remember, you might have trouble getting through on the phone during an emergency. Just keep trying.



What would I do if I were at school?

Make sure your parents talk to your teacher or school principal about the school's emergency plan.
Depending on the unexpected event, your school may have a plan in place that will have you stay in your classroom or go somewhere else.
The most important things you can do if an emergency happens while you are at school are to stay calm and listen to the direction of your teachers or principal.



What would we do about our pets?

Your pet disaster kit should include:

Pet food and treats
Drinkable water in plastic bottles
Can opener for canned food
Pet medications and medical records in a waterproof container
Sturdy leashes, harnesses and/or carriers so you can move your pets safely and they can’t escape (remember they may be scared and may act different than usual)
Current photos of your pet in case they get lost
The name of your veterinarian
Pet beds and toys, if there is room.
All your pets should have an identification tag and collar, too.


Make a plan for what you'll do with your pets if you can't take them with you. Remember, you may not be able to take them to a shelter.



, OK, now you have a supply kit and a plan, but what do you actually know about different kinds of weather events and other unexpected situations? The words and terms you hear during emergencies can be confusing. Here's an overview of the most common terms, as well as Web sites you can visit for more information!



Tornado A violent storm that appears as a funnel-shaped cone with winds that reach up to 300 mph (480 km/h). Tornado season commonly occurs during the months of March through August, but they can occur at any time. They can happen in any state but are most commonly found in Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, and Texas - an area of which is commonly called ""Tornado Alley"".
If there are weather or news reports that say there is a tornado in your area, the most important thing to do is to take shelter immediately in a place without windows, such as a bathroom or a basement. Learn more here →


Earthquake The movement of the earth along cracks (called fault lines) in the earth's surface. Earthquakes are measured by something called a Richter scale. While earthquakes are common on the West Coast, they can occur in 45 states and territories across the United States.
In an earthquake, remember to DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. DROP to the floor and get under something for COVER and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. Learn more here →


Fire Emergencies Fires are unexpected events that can happen anywhere at school, at home, in a store or shopping mall, or even in the outdoors in a forest or field. It is important to always know where the emergency exits are and to remember to be calm during a fire emergency.
The most important thing you can do during a fire is listen to the direction of adults around you, like your teacher or parent. Remember to use the stairs (NEVER use an elevator) to leave the building or fire area right away, then Flooding This natural condition happens as a result of river overflow, heavy rains, a dam breaking, or snow melting too fast. This is the most common natural weather event and can happen in every U.S. state. Stay as far away from flood water as you can. Moving flood water can be dangerous because it can knock you off your feet. And any type of flood water can be contaminated, meaning it can contain dangerous substances. Learn more here →


Tsunami A giant wave produced by underwater movement due to a variety of natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and meteorites. Tsunamis generally appear in the Pacific Ocean. If you feel an earthquake in the Pacific Coast area, turn on your battery-powered radio to learn if there is a tsunami warning. If you hear a tsunami warning, and they say to evacuate, do this immediately. Learn more here →


Hurricane A tropical storm with an ""eye."" Winds must be 74 mph (119 km/h) or stronger for weather to be classified as a hurricane.
When hurricanes come onto land, their heavy rain, strong winds and heavy waves can damage buildings, trees and cars. It is important to take shelter in a hurricane and listen to the television or radio for instructions. Learn more here →


Terrorism Terrorism is the use of threat or violence to scare governments into changing their policies. A terrorist can be an individual or a member of an organization. The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, are examples of acts of terrorism.
Talk to your parents or teacher about this kind of emergency.

Lift the door by the doorknob. If you can move it upward, the the hinges are probably loose. Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws holding the hinges in place.
If the hinge screws spin but won't tighten, you will need to replace them. You may also need to fill the holes with wood plugs and re-drive the new screws into those plugs.
Similarly, if the doorknob itself moves when you lift it, you should tighten or replace it.;
, If your door had weatherstripping previously installed, it might be damaged or deformed. Check by running your hand around the perimeter of the door while the door is closed.









If you can feel a draft while checking the seal, you will need to remove the old weatherstripping and replace it with a new seal.
To remove old weatherstripping, simply peel or slide it away.

, Use a damp rag to wipe away any visible dirt and debris from the door frame and the edges of the door itself.









Drag the edge of a paint scraper along the top, bottom, and sides of the door and door frame to remove any stuck debris from these surfaces.Check the threshold (the bottom of the door frame). If there are grooves along the threshold, run a large nail through the grooves to scrape away any gunk that has gotten itself lodged in there.

, There are several different types of weatherstripping available, so you'll need to decide which one you wish to use.









For the top and sides of your door, wrapped foam weatherstripping is durable and works well with gaps of various sizes. Weatherstripping with a wooden shell is durable yet easier to work with than metal weatherstripping, so it makes a good choice for someone who has no prior experience sealing doors.
If purchasing a weatherstripping kit, note that most kits only contain weatherstripping for the top and sides of your door. You will need to purchase a separate door sweep.
For the door sweep, consider using a metal door sweep with a flexible vinyl flap for greater durability. This type of sweep is also fairly easy to install. Brush or auto-lift vinyl seals are usually the most versatile and easiest to work with, especially when you've never sealed a door before. More advanced options include storm-proof seals and roller door seals.Note, however, that rigid door sweeps will not work if the carpet is higher or even with the threshold. When rigid door sweeps won't work, use flexible bulb weatherstripping made of vinyl.

, Close the door and measure along the top of the frame using a tape measure.









Note that your measurements for the top and sides of the door will need to be made along the door frame and not the door itself.

, With the door still closed, measure along both sides of the frame with a tape measure.









You should measure both sides separately and cut the weatherstripping accordingly. Both sides will usually be the same length, but errors in construction are common enough, so there can be some slight variations in length. To achieve a tight seal, you will need to measure cut pieces of weatherstripping that are tailor fit to each side, which means that you will need to know the precise length of each side.

, Open the door, then measure the bottom of it using a tape measure.









Unlike the measurements you took for the top and side seals, you will need to measure for the bottom seal by measuring the bottom of the door itself.
Make sure that you face the inside of the door as you take this measurement.

, Use a tape measure to measure out each length onto the weatherstripping you purchased.









Mark each length using a sharp pencil or marker. Make sure that each line you draw is clear and sharp.
When using a weatherstripping kit, you should be given two long pieces for the sides and one short piece for the top. Make sure to draw your top measurement on the short piece and your side measurements on the long pieces.

, Cut the weatherstripping at the marks you just measured out. Keep your cuts as clean and even as possible to ensure a tight seal.









The foam and vinyl portions can be cut using sharp scissors, but you will need a hacksaw or similar tool to cut any wood portions. When cutting any angles into wood weatherstripping, use a coping saw.
You'll also need to make sure that one end of each side piece is angled to fit into the top piece of weatherstripping. You do not need to angle the bottom end of your side pieces, however.

, Position the top piece of weatherstripping along the top of your door frame, then loosely nail it into place.








This seal must be installed along the door frame and not onto the door itself.
Use 1-1/2 inch (3.75 cm) nails. Place the nails 2 inches (5 cm) in from either side to prevent splitting. Nails should also be 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart.
When you place the weatherstripping, the foam should completely fill in the gap at the top of the frame. It should only compress slightly, however, and not too tightly. Tight compression may prevent the door from latching.
Only hammer the nails enough to hold the weatherstripping in place. Do not finish driving the nails until you add the side pieces.

, Position the side pieces of weatherstripping along the sides of your door frame. If the top angle does not fit into the top piece of weatherstripping, file it down.









As with the top piece, your side pieces will need to fit onto the door frame instead of the actual door.
You can use a metal file, sandpaper, or sanding belt to fine-tune these top angles.
Make small adjustments and check the fit periodically until you reach the proper angle.

, Place each side piece along the sides of the door frame and tack them into place with a hammer and nails.









As with the top piece of weatherstripping, use 1-1/2 inch nails and place them 2 inches (5 cm) from either end. Nails should be spaced 12 inches (30.5 cm) apart from one another.
Make sure that the foam completely fills in any gaps along the sides of the door frame. The foam should only compress slightly, however.
For now, only hammer the nails in enough to hold the weatherstripping loosely in place.

, Open and close the door several times to make sure that the weatherstripping seals properly.









The weatherstripping must completely seal against the door as it closes, and the door must be able to latch and lock.
Remove and adjust the placement of your weatherstripping as needed to achieve a proper seal.

, Once the weatherstripping along the top and sides of the door seals properly, you should finish hammering in the nails.









Note that it is also a good idea to test the seal once more after you finish hammering in the nails. Open and close the door to make sure that the seal still holds.

, Place the door sweep along the bottom edge of the door, but do not screw or nail it into place yet.









The flexible portion of the door sweep must touch the top of the threshold, but it should not rub against it too tightly.
Metal door sweeps will already have screw holes in them. Mark the position of these holes onto your door using a pencil or marker. Remove the door sweep temporarily, then drill pilot holes into these marked portions.
Note that vinyl door sweeps are installed on the threshold instead of the door, however. Align one end of the strip with one end of the threshold. Using your hands, firmly press the flanges into the grooves of the threshold.

, Push the door sweep against the bottom threshold of the door. Use a screwdriver to screw the sweep in place.









Insert the screws into your previously drilled pilot holes.
When using a vinyl door sweep, place a wood tapping block over the weatherstripping. Strike the block with your hammer to drive the flanges of the weatherstripping deep into the grooves of the threshold.

, Open and close the door several times to test the bottom seal.









Once the sides, top, and bottom portions of weatherstripping are properly installed, the process is complete. Your door should now be sealed.

Put a solid wood door on your bedroom.,
Keep the cell phone charged.,
Leave a light on at night in a room.,
Draw the curtains.,
Keep bushes around your house low.,
Keep the area outside your house well-lit.,
Keep doors and windows locked and shut at night.,
Invest in a burglar alarm.",How to Protect Yourself in Your Home," This creates a ""second barrier"" even if someone were to break into your home while you slept. This would possibly give you few seconds to wake up, get yourself together, and grab your gun. It's also a safe place that you could run to if someone was breaking in a door or entering your house during the day.;
, Also, at night, keep the cellphone charged and in the bedroom with you. A burglar might somehow disable your house phones, making it impossible for you to call for help.

, This will give the impression that someone is still up and awake.

, Don't let people see straight into your house.

, Or remove them. These are intruder/burglar hidey-holes and can be very attractive to someone wanting to hide. If your house is more open, the neighbors can help keep an eye on things for you. Don't forget to ask them to!

, Well-lit areas deter would-be intruders who have no shadows to hide themselves in.

,


Even during the day, be aware of which rooms have open windows.
If you can invest in windows that lock while open a small way, that is a great option.
For sliding windows and doors, place a strong piece of dowel in the sliding slot to prevent the window sliding back any further.
Always keep the front and back entrance doors locked. Keep keys close by, but not in sight range from outside.

, They scare away burglars as soon as they enter the house, or better still, there are some that will go off if anybody touches a window, door etc.

Install motion-sensing lighting.,
Trim your trees and shrubs regularly.,
Place a home alarm system decal prominently.,
Store outdoor equipment out of sight.,
Keep your garage doors locked.",How to Prevent Residential Burglary1," Install motion-sensing lights by your driveway, garage, back door, and/or your front door. These lights will turn on when motion is detected, helping to deter approaching criminals. When choosing your lights, read the outside of the box to see what is involved in installing the lights. Install them per the instructions. It is recommended that you install passive infrared lights, low pressure sodium-vapor lights, or floodlights to deter criminals.
You can purchase these at your local hardware store.;
, Keep the trees and shrubs near your windows and doors trimmed. This will prevent burglars from being able to hide and launch an attack on your house., Place the decal next to the front door, or place it on a window facing the street. You can also place it next to your mailbox, or along the walkway leading up to your front door. Alarm decals will make criminals second guess their decision to break into your home.If you do not have an alarm decal, then display a “beware of dog” or community watch decal in your front yard instead.

, Store bicycles, lawnmowers, snow blowers, and other expensive pieces of equipment in your garage or a locked shed. Also make sure to store your barbecue grill inside your garage, or somewhere in your backyard that is out of sight., Unless you are actively using it, make sure to keep your garage doors locked at all times. Do this even when you are inside the house, especially if your garage is attached to your house.If you have a shed, make sure to keep it locked as well.

"

Cover your windows with curtains or blinds.,
Place your valuables out of sight.,
Install an alarm system.,
Keep your doors locked.,
Lock your windows.,
Avoid hiding your spare key.",How to Prevent Residential Burglary2," Curtains and blinds are a great way to prevent lurking criminals from looking inside your house to see what you have. Keep all of your windows covered when you are not home, especially the ones facing the street.Since it is very easy to see inside windows when the lights are on and it is dark outside, make sure to keep them covered when you are home at night.

, Try to avoid placing valuable items like TVs, stereos, jewelry, game systems, and other valuables in front of windows, or in the window’s direct line of sight. Instead, place them against the wall or off to the side. If a criminal cannot determine what kind of valuable items you have, then they are less likely to break in.Additionally, make sure to cut up the delivery boxes of expensive items. Place the pieces in a trash bag and throw it away. This will prevent a lurking thief from seeing what kind of valuable items you own.

, Even if it is a basic alarm system, you should install one. Plus, many insurance companies cover home alarm systems. Contact yours to see which alarm systems are covered. ADT, Frontpoint, and Link Interactive offer great deals on home alarm systems.You can also find home alarm systems at your local hardware store.
Alarm systems give homeowners piece of mind when they are away from home, as well as while they sleeping at night.

, Install deadbolt locks on your doors and keep them locked at all times. If you have a wooden doorframe, then use strike plates and heavy-duty screws to prevent your door form being kicked in. Because they are very easy to open, avoid pushbutton locks on your doors.Alternatively, you can install an ANSI grade 1 lock if you do not want to install deadbolt locks.
To secure sliding glass doors, install a latch or a track blocker to prevent burglars from opening them easily. If you have an older sliding glass door, then install an anti-lift device as well.

, Make sure your windows have latches and keep them locked at all times, especially bottom story windows. Like doors, you can also install blocking devices onto your windows for added security.If you can, try to purchase windows that are made out of laminated or tempered glass. These types of glass are much stronger than the glass used to make traditional windows.

, Criminals are well aware of hiding spots for spare keys, like under the front door’s mat, or inside flowerpots and mailboxes. Instead, have a trusted neighbor, friend, or family member hold your spare key for you."
"
Place timers on lights.,
Have someone pick up your mail, newspapers, and fliers.,
Park your car in the garage.,
Let your neighbors know you will be out of town.",How to Prevent Residential Burglary3," Connect lamps in different parts of the house to timers, especially lamps whose lights you can see from the street. Have them turn on during different parts of the day and night. This will give criminals the impression that someone is home.For example, have a lamp or two turn on at 7 p.m. and off at 11 p.m. to indicate that someone is home. Then have another lamp turn on 6 a.m. and off at 8 a.m.
You can also place a timer on your TV.
You can find timers at your local hardware store.

, Piles of these items indicate to criminals that you have been away from home. Have a neighbor, friend, or family member pick up these items while you are on vacation to make it seem as if you are home.Alternatively, contact the post office and have them hold your mail for you while you are gone.
If you will be gone for an extended period, like a month, then schedule someone to mow your lawn while you are gone as well.

, Parking your car in the garage makes it harder for a thief to decipher if you are home or not. Make sure to park your car(s) in the garage before you leave. Also try to park it in the garage regularly while you are home. This will make it even more difficult for a thief to know when you are or are not home.If you don’t have a garage or room for your car, then park your car in the driveway. Make sure to lock your car and remove valuable items from it before you leave.

, Ask them to keep an eye on your house while you are gone. If you have timers on your lights (or your TV), then let them know the timers’ schedule. This way, they will be able to tell if there is any suspicious activity going on inside of your house.Tell them to contact the police if they see or suspect any suspicious behavior.

Try using a working alarm system is always a good measure.,
Locking doors and windows are a good measure.,
Destroy boxes.,
Leave lights on if you're leaving.,
Trust your neighbors.,
Close your garage.,
Keep things put away and out of sight if possible, so a snooping stranger can't see valuables through windows.,
If you have glass next to your outside doors use a double dead bolt, so they can't reach in though broken glass and unbolt the door.,
Plant thorny bushes near windows that may be vulnerable to break-in to deter thieves.

,
Eliminate tall shrubs near doors and windows that may allow thieves to be concealed from watchful neighbors as they attempt to break into your home.

,
Be certain to secure windows into your garage.,
Secure upper story windows, and especially doors to decks or balconies.,
Add exterior lighting to your home so that visitors are in plain sight of your neighbors when approaching your home.,
If you have to park your car outside, park in a well lit area and keep it locked.,

If you have a keypad garage door opener installed outside your home, be smart about the code.,
Be cautious about workers and contractors working at your house or your neighbor's house.",How to Prevent a Robbery," Getting one isn't very hard and usually not expensive. These alarms can be a great deterrent for burglars. Make sure, however, that it is professionally installed.;
, Unlocked doors and windows make it easy for someone to rob your house. If a lock doesn't work, get it fixed immediately.

, As strange as it may seem, people may want to rob you for what is on a box at the end of your driveway. If you have a box that shows a plasma screen TV or something else very expensive, you want to get rid of it.

, If a house looks vacant and unprepared, that house may be a victim of a robbery. Leaving lights on is a safe measure for any house.

, If you're going to be gone for a while, neighbors can help protect your house.

, Leaving it open, even during the day puts your car and its contents at risk from strangers passing your house. Be especially vigilant about closing it at night. If you see your neighbors garage open after bedtime, call them to let them know. They will appreciate the call, and likely return the favor if you inadvertently leave your garage open.

, This goes for your car as well.

, Keep a key for the deadbolt inside the house near the door at all times so you can escape easily in case of a fire.

,,, For sliding windows use channel locks that clamp on or a stick that keeps the window from sliding open. Once in your garage, thieves have many opportunities to break into your house using your own tools from the garage. And unfortunately once in your garage often the door leading into your home is unlocked. So lock it, with a dead bolt, and keep it locked when you are gone or asleep.

, These can often be reached by athletic youth or experienced thieves seeking easy access into your home.

, Leave them on when you are gone, or put them on motion sensors, and/or light sensors so they are on at dusk and/or when someone approaches your house.

, You may want to invest in a car alarm as well.

, Most thoughtful thieves will find a hidden key if they have time to search. If you have to keep a key outside your home keep it at a neighbors house. You could even keep it hidden outside their house if you are concerned about them being unavailable when you need your key.

, Don't use a number that could be looked up by a determined thief. Avoid birthdays, addresses, phone numbers, or sequenced or repetitive numbers. It is okay, not best, but okay to combine numbers, such as the first two digits of your phone number plus the month you were born. Or you could use two digits from your Mom's birthday and two digits from your Dad's birthday. Don't share this code with anyone but your immediate family.

, If you have valuable equipment or tools, put them out of sight, out of mind. For a few it, may be tempting to help themselves to your stuff, or tell a friend where there are some valuable items to be lifted at a later date.

Get a doggy door in the door that connects your garage to your house, if they are connected.",How to Prevent Secondhand Smoke from Entering Your Garage1," You will usually find cracks in the corners of the bottom of the garage door when it's closed, as well as a rectangular hole somewhere else along the wall with nothing but wire closing it - that hole is for ventilation, to get ""fresh"" air from outside.;
, Put one large piece of plywood over it, and nail that right outside of the hole where the wall touches the board. Only do this if the hole faces the direction you think the some is coming from.

, Get some rubber patches and put them in any large gaps in the bottom corners. Staple, melt, glue or even just tape them to the rubber cushion above the gap.

, While this won't remove any of the chemicals or gases found in car exhaust and tobacco smoke or raise the oxygen content, it will certainly make it color and smells will be less noticeable.

, Here is a perfect example of one, modify it a little to fit whatever the situation is;


Dear ________, I've been smelling smoke in my garage lately, and I may not be the only one on this street smelling your smoke. I respect your right to smoke, and understand why you don't smoke inside your house. Smoking outside shifts the problem elsewhere, from your kids and spouse to your neighbors and the public. I want my right as a member of the non-smoking majority respected just as much as you want your rights as a smoker respected. Please find somewhere to smoke where it affects no unwilling people.

, Remember; be sure to go over all the points mentioned in the letter. Always use good manners, even if it is clear that you could have telling points and win in an argument; smokers will do anything to justify smoking and defend it simply because of their chemical addiction.

They also may be available in the local library or on your city's website.
Typical requirements include peepholes and deadbolt locks. Some cities also may require locks on windows or bars on sliding glass doors.;
, Well-lit parking lots and common areas can deter would-be criminals and make residents feel safer.If lights go out, replace the bulbs as soon as possible. If you have maintenance employees, have one of them patrol at night once a week to check the lights – don't wait until a tenant complains.
Keep in mind that thefts and many other crimes are crimes of opportunity. A criminal is less likely to see an opportunity in a clean, well-lit parking lot.

, Plants along walkways and beside buildings can provide cover for people committing crimes.Keeping hedges trimmed so that they don't conceal windows or doorways is an easy and relatively inexpensive way to prevent crime.
If you've hired a landscaping company, talk to the head landscaper and make sure he or she is aware of the security concerns with any plants or bushes located near doors or windows on the property.

, An active security presence may deter criminal activity and loitering around your rental properties.


Having someone patrol at night, if nothing else, can help prevent crime and make residents feel more secure.
Any law enforcement officers who rent from you may be willing to patrol the grounds occasionally, or even park their patrol cars in a highly visible area, in exchange for a reduction in rent.
You also might consider talking to your tenants about starting a community watch program in the neighborhood. Particularly if you have a large apartment complex, vigilant tenants can be your first line of defense against crime in and around your property.

, If your rental properties are located in a particularly dangerous neighborhood, you might want to take other precautions to secure the premises.Typically you will be held responsible for crime if it was foreseeable and you took no steps to prevent it. Therefore, if your rental property is located in a high-crime area, you may legally be expected to do more than a landlord whose property is in a wealthy suburb.
You might consider bars on windows, or installing alarm systems in all your units. Usually you will be able to pass the costs of these measures on to your tenants, and most will be willing to pay a little extra in exchange for the peace of mind that added security brings.

, Not only does walking give you the chance to interact with tenants, but you can spot security issues more clearly on foot.If you see any problems or room for improvement, remedy the situation as soon as possible.
Notify tenants of any activities that threaten security on the property. For example, if you notice tenants are using a rock to prop open a hallway door that normally is closed and locked, that could allow an unauthorized person to enter the building.

, Residents who live in your units and come in and out every day probably have strong ideas about how to improve security.


Take input from tenants seriously. If they feel safe, and know you care about their safety, they may take more responsibility for their unit and its surroundings.
Encourage your tenants to do their part as well to prevent crime, for example by securing their belongings, keeping doors and windows locked, and promptly reporting any suspicious activity.

, Many local police departments will send an officer to evaluate the security of your property free of charge at your request.Some precincts also offer training courses or informational sessions on landlord-tenant issues and preventing crime around rental properties.
Contact your police department or look on your city's website to find out what resources are available in your area.

, If a tenant notifies you of a problem that has security implications, don't delay to address the issue.Keep in mind that you may be liable for crime that occurs as a result of something you failed to fix within a reasonable amount of time.
For example, if a tenant's unit is burglarized by a thief who entered a door with a broken lock, you may be on the hook for the tenant's losses if the tenant notified you of the broken lock weeks before the robbery and you failed to act.
You also should inform your tenants of their responsibility to notify you immediately if there are any damages to the property that represent a threat to security.

, Anyone who works in or around your rental property on a regular basis should know how to identify security breaches and how to maintain the utmost privacy and security around your rental property.


When you're getting a vacant unit ready for new tenants, double-check the locks and windows. Make sure the locks all are functional and can be operated without difficulty, and that any window locks aren't stuck or painted over.
Maintain strict protocols on keys to units, and only allow you and your manager access to the master key, if you have one at all. Keep track of keys you give to tenants, and rekey the locks each time a tenant moves out.

, Although you probably maintain liability insurance, renter's insurance will cover your tenants' belongings in the event of a burglary or other crime.Renter's insurance is fairly easy to find and in most cases isn't very expensive. Most renters can buy a policy that covers all of their property for between $20 and $30 a month.
Residents who have to pay a renter's insurance premium also may become more aware of their surroundings and the security of their unit.

, A crime-free addendum makes criminal activity a lease violation subject to immediate eviction.The crime-free addendum makes it clear that engaging in criminal activity in or around your property is prohibited.
The addendum should cover activities conducted by guests of your tenants as well as the tenants themselves.
In most states, you don't have to wait for a conviction to evict someone suspected of or arrested for criminal activity.

Purchase an air conditioning cage.,
Purchase an air conditioning alarm.,
Place an eye in the sky.,
Deny easy access.",How to Prevent Air Conditioner Theft," One of the most basic, but effective ways to safe-guard your air conditioner or heat pump is to buy a specially designed cage for it. Cages are arguably the most effective deterrent to prevent a stolen unit because of its immediate visibility. Two reliable company's that manufacture steel air conditioner cages are Durablecages.com and SafeguardAC.com. For a few hundred dollars you can buy peace of mind via a well-enforced solid steel cage. The purchase of an air conditioner cage is the only physical deterrent you can buy. They also provide protection when you're not there unlike some of the products on the market today.;
, Air conditioning alarms can be purchased as a more expensive, yet less visible alternative to an air conditioning cage. Homeowners may consider an alarm if they wish to keep the unit looking as clean and normal as possible. Most air conditioning alarms are based on the same pressure-sensitive premise, yet the technology behind the alarm can vary based on the company. Even if you chose not to purchase a full alarm system for your unit, you can buy a fake alarm sticker. Homeowners have been using similar stickers to warn thieves that their home is protected by an alarm system, even if it isn’t. Such stickers are an effective and cheap alternative to a full alarm system.

, The technology savvy homeowner may already own a system of surveillance cameras to monitor various areas surrounding their homes. A motion-activated surveillance camera near your air conditioner, coupled with a warning sign is a sure way to motivate thieves to move on to an easier target. Install floodlights or motion-sensing outdoor lights near the unit to increase the effectiveness of surveillance cameras.

, In some cases, homeowners may have the option to elevate an air conditioner or heat pump or at least move it to a less accessible and visible area. Hiding your unit behind shrubbery or a small fence may be enough to thwart would be thieves looking a fast way to make an illegal buck. Plus, the new landscaping can be a welcomed edition to any backyard.

Change your home's exterior door locks.,

Keep an eye out for your neighbors.,
Never invite strangers into your home.,
Get a dog.,
Keep things inside.,
Take things out of your car.,
Keep your blinds closed.,

Keep your home well-lit.,
Eliminate hiding spots around your home.,
Be careful on the Internet.",How to Prevent Theft," For the optimum security, your home needs to be outfitted with strong deadbolts and door locks to keep your stuff and your family safe. You can do this yourself, as door locks are easy and inexpensive to replace. Once you do, always lock them and instruct your family to always lock them.


It's possible that older residents likely have kept a copy of your key, so it's good to change the locks if you've just moved in, to help prevent theft.;
, Having an alarm reduces the likelihood of a break-in, and makes the effects of a break-in much more minor. You can engage the alarm when you're away, as well as setting it to night or stay mode, for your own safety while you're in for the night. Invest in a system that will alert the police (or fire station) immediately and your home phone should receive a call from them asking if everything is all right.


Shop around for the best monthly monitoring prices. The brands you probably know from television cost four times per month more than other companies that are probably local to you. Knowing the pricing of other companies will help you negotiate a lower rate.
Be sure to use the alarm each time you go out, and change the code every year or two, using something hard to guess but easy to remember for the code.
If the alarm company offers signs for windows or lawn, use them. The whole idea is to make your home less attractive for an easy theft.

, You can help prevent theft at your home by putting a clear thick window film on your ground floor and basement windows to keep them from breaking-in. There are clear, frosted and reflective (mirrored) films, depending on your privacy needs. This is commonly used in earthquake country to prevent shattering, and is also useful to resist a break-and-enter type of theft.

, Help your neighborhood by getting to know the cars and habits of your neighbors. This may seem like a little thing, but thieves really do target places where they think they are blending in or not noticed. Once they know someone is very aware of them, they will feel uncomfortable and will quickly move on. As you probably can't be home all the time, this works best if you can encourage your neighbors to do the same.


If you see someone strange or a strange vehicle near your house, go out and offer to help them with directions (pretend to think that they are lost) or otherwise engage them ""how are you, how is your day."" Be polite and never challenge them (""what are you doing here"") as a confrontation could be a risk to safety. A thief will talk as little as possible and then move on to the next neighborhood.

, If they arrive at your door, go outside to talk with them, locking your door behind. Many thieves use some excuse to come into the home to get some idea of what to steal. Going outside will help deter them. If they ask, politely say no.


If they claim to be from your town government, ask to see ID first and take their picture using your mobile phone. A real government official won't be upset by this and may even congratulate you on being safe.
Always document strangers who come around or seem suspicious in some way. Take a quick picture just to have it in case something happens in the future.

, Dogs, even small dogs and docile animals, can help to deter theft. Thieves don't want to mess with potential dog-alarms and bites. If you're concerned about security at your home, consider investing in a family pet who will have the added benefit of barking its head off any time someone comes around with ill intent. This can help you feel safe and provide you with an added layer of security.

, Be sure to put away bicycles, radios or anything of value away when you're not using them or done for the day to reduce their visibility to the passerby. Expensive tools, shoes and other things should never be left out where they could be easily taken.

, Never leave coins, paper money, wallets, radios, mobile phones or computers visible through the windows of your car. Take them inside and store them properly. This can encourage vehicle theft, and possibly more.

, There's no need to broadcast that you've got a big plasma screen television inside and a new Macbook sitting on your desk. Thieves will be much less interested in gambling with what you've got inside if they can't see it. There's no sense in drawing attention to what you've got.

, If you are one of the lucky ones with a garage and you keep anything like tools, bicycle or expensive vehicles in it, keep it closed most of the time to prevent anyone passing by taking mental inventory of what you have as incentive to possibly break in later.

, Increase night visibility around your home by employing outdoor lighting. Modern LEDs are waterproof and use much less wattage than conventional outdoor lighting.

, Consider removing any bushes that are growing against the home providing hiding spots. If you have a fence, keep the gates closed and put up no trespassing signs, which suggests to thieves that you're taking security seriously.

, Don't publish personal information such as your telephone number, address, and detailed lists of things you own and your daily activity. If you let everyone know you're out of the town for three days, your new stereo could become an attractive theft option.


If you post a picture in the place you live, be careful not to let the GPS turned on, so everybody will find out where you live.

In most industrialized countries, weather forecasting makes it unlikely that blizzards will arrive without warning. Even a severe snowstorm is generally expected several days in advance.

During a severe snowstorm, travel should be curtailed unless it is a real emergency. And even then, consider if emergency vehicles are more equipped to handle your issue than you are.
If you are unfamiliar with driving in winter conditions, as a general rule, do not drive.
Take winter weather advisories, watches, and warnings (or equivalents) seriously. Having to re-schedule your vacation may be an inconvenience, but getting into a car accident is a much bigger problem.
Keep a few useful winter tools. A more detailed list will follow below. Most drivers will not typically have an entire trunk full of emergency items, but in most cold weather climates, drivers should usually keep the following as a precaution:

Sand or cat litter: for emergency traction. The weight of sand can also help traction in lighter vehicles although fuel efficiency will be reduced slightly. Cat litter has the added bonus, if put in a tied-off sock on the dashboard, of drawing in moisture and preventing condensation on the windshield
Wool blanket: In case of getting stuck, this helps with freezing temperatures. It is also handy for impromptu seating in winter events.
Extra boots: If you are wearing inappropriate foot gear, your feet could freeze. Putting an old pair of boots in the trunk helps cover this issue. Also, it is handy if you forgot your boots and it snows.
Extra gloves, hat, scarf: In case of being stuck in freezing weather, these items are vital. These can be old and mismatched, but they should be warm.

;
, Before winter arrives or you plan to drive in snowy conditions, make sure your anti-freeze and windshield wiper fluids are full, your wipers are working properly, your tires are properly inflated and have sufficient tread, and that your brakes and battery are both in good shape. Check to ensure all of your lights work and that your engine oil has been changed. Freezing temperatures and bad road conditions greatly affect how both the mechanics of your vehicle function and how your vehicle handles on the road., When the weather is bad, make sure you have a full tank of gas. In really hazardous winter weather watches and blizzard watches the effects of the storm can be 72 hours or more. So the more gas you have, the better in case you become stranded. You will need it to help you stay warm, to ensure your fuel lines do not freeze, that your battery stays charged, and that you have enough gas left to leave after the storm, if needed., Your first priorities are supplies needed to provide warmth, fluids and food, followed by various instruments needed to weather and escape the storm. A hard-walled cooler to store both your food and water supplies is nearly ideal. Also get a hard plastic, durable storage tub for the rest of your supplies. It needs a tight-sealing lid so if you must take it out of your vehicle, nothing inside will get wet., During a blizzard or snowstorm, when temperatures are below freezing, a person can only survive for about three hours without shelter from wind and moisture, two of the ways a person’s body loses heat. Since your vehicle will be your shelter, you want to add supplemental items.


Keep heat inside the vehicle using insulating items such as newspapers or blankets.
Keep heat inside your body. Clothing and blankets, for example, do not provide heat or warmth but they’re vital because they preserve or help trap the heat your body generates.
Hypothermia, which only requires a 2-3 degree drop in a person’s body temperature, is the chief cause of death from exposure to freezing temperatures. The first effect is an inability to think clearly.
Put one wool blanket for each person you anticipate could be in the vehicle in your trunk or in the storage tub, plus two more for other uses. Wool dries quickly if it gets wet and keeps you much warmer than many other materials.
You want to also add an extra set of clothing for each person, plus two sets of socks per person. Wool socks are best. Avoid cotton clothing, such as jeans, as these become essentially useless at retaining warmth when wet.
Include scarves, hats and water-resistant gloves to help preserve heat in high-loss areas like the head and neck and to keep your hands from becoming wet.
Keep a pair of winter boots in the car. In northern rural climates, it is fairly common for people to keep a pair of boots (typically old) in the trunk. In an emergency, bad footwear can be dangerous in the snow, leading to frostbite.
Keep hand warmers in the car. While good gloves or mittens are better prevention, these are handy. You can get in the camping and hunting goods sections of big box stores.
Get 5-10 newspapers, depending upon your vehicle size, to insulate your vehicle’s windows. This will help trap in the heat your bodies produce, the heat your vehicle produces if and when you turn it on and to serve as a barrier against the wind., A person can survive for three days without fluids, though it would not be a pleasant experience by any means. To stay adequately hydrated, a person should consume 64 ounces of fluids per day. The typical water bottle is about 15-16 ounces, which would be 12-13 bottles per person for a 72-hour period. For a family of five, that’s 60-65 bottles of water, an unrealistic number to carry in your vehicle at all times. While jugs are an alternative, the plastic used is more likely to warp and break when exposed to extreme temperatures. Therefore, the following is recommended.


Yes, you can melt snow to produce water. However, snow is mostly air, and produces surprisingly little water. While a camp stove, burner, or campfire could potentially melt snow to produce water, this is not ideal.
Put enough water bottles in the cooler for each person for one day. So, for example, you would put about 20 bottles in the cooler for a family of five. If you have extra room, load up with as many bottles as possible.
Since this won’t be enough if you’re stranded for longer than one day, you’ll need to melt snow. To do this, you need the following: a 2- to 3-pound coffee can with its lid, several boxes of waterproof matches, three 2” diameter candles and one or more metal cups., Food is the body’s fuel, supplying the energy needed to generate heat. When a person’s body is exposed to freezing temperatures, over half of the calories consumed go toward maintaining a normal body temperature. Thus, the colder it is, the more food people need. In normal temperatures, an adequately hydrated person can survive without food from 1- 6 weeks, depending on a number of factors. In freezing temperatures, that number tops out at about 3 weeks.


Given that the average American eats about 2,300 calories per day, half of which would be stripped away to regulate body temperature while trapped in a vehicle, minimally each person should eat about 3,500 calories per day.
That is a quite a bit of food for a family of five over the course of 72 hours. To make it all fit in your cooler, buy dense non-perishable, high-calorie foods, such as granola bars, beef jerky, nuts, trail mix, canned fruits and chocolate.Scale down according to your needs. Most individuals caught in a blizzard will not be stuck for days. Unless you are going to be in a very remote area, you do not need to prepare many days worth of rations. In reasonably well-settled areas, you can likely expect help to reach you in hours and not days. Therefore, you may want to consider having the equivalent of a solid snack. These are often stowed in the glove compartment of the vehicle in snowy climates.

Make sure this item is shelf-stable and not likely to perish anytime soon.
This food should likely not be a favorite of yours, as you will likely be tempted to eat it and not replace it when an emergency arises.
Do not store water in glove compartment, as if the water bottle breaks it will likely ruin your registration, insurance card, maps, service records, and so on. The trunk is usually better.
If you are diabetic, be very sure to have a snack available.



, You’ll need to collect a number of items to dig your vehicle out of the snow if needed, to assist others in helping to locate you, to be attuned to weather and road conditions, to take care of basic needs if trapped and to improvise and fix unanticipated problems. Once you’ve collected your supplies, listed below, put them in your storage tub. Regularly check to make sure everything is in good shape and working.


Flares to indicate your location to rescuers.
A piece of bright red material about 1-by-4 feet in size.
A wind-up or transistor radio with several spare batteries so you can keep tabs on the weather and road conditions. Also, for entertainment, as boredom tends to cause people to do unwise things.
Flashlights with very bright bulbs and plenty of batteries to use at night and to use in signaling for help.
Jumper cables, which you may need when the storm passes, and your vehicle’s battery has died.
A collapsible, preferably metal snow shovel.
Tow rope to either a) help get your vehicle unstuck or b) tie one end to the vehicle and the other to a person’s waist if it’s absolutely necessary for someone to leave the vehicle during the storm.
A compass.
A bag of sand, salt or cat litter to give your tires traction if stuck.
A long-handled ice scraper with a brush.
A tool kit for any surprises.
A pocket knife with a can opener.
A wind-up watch to keep track of time.
A first-aid kit.
An emergency supply of medicine for each person for 72 hours.
One pair of tall, waterproof boots for the driver of the vehicle.
Tissue paper, paper towels and garbage bags for sanitary purposes.
Feminine products and baby formula, diapers and wipes, if necessary., If a storm is approaching and you don’t need to leave, stay put. Make sure you understand the difference between winter storm watches and warnings. A winter storm watch indicates there’s a 50-80% chance that a considerable amount of sleet, snow, ice or a combination of two or more will affect a certain area. A winter storm warning means there’s at least an 80% chance that one or more are on their way to a certain area. A blizzard warning or watch signals that significant amounts of falling snow and strong winds of at least 35 mph (56.3 km/h) that will reduce visibility to less than ¼ of a mile are highly likely or expected in the next 12-72 hours.


Remember: While you may feel confident driving in blustery weather, plenty of people you’re sharing the road with are less experienced. And, Mother Nature hits even the most seasoned drivers with unexpected surprises.
If you plan to drive in potentially hazardous conditions, always let a trusted friend or family member know of your plans and route., If you find yourself stuck and try to dislodge your vehicle to leave, you first need to turn off your vehicle and make sure your exhaust pipe isn’t clogged with snow; if it is clogged, your vehicle can quickly fill up with poisonous carbon monoxide. To unclog it, turn off your engine, put on gloves and dig out as much snow as possible. If you don’t have gloves, use a branch or something similar., It you’ve been stuck for awhile and decide to try to get your vehicle out, start removing snow from the roof of your vehicle and work your way down. While you’re doing this, turn on the engine and defrost to start melting any ice on your front and back windshields. Next, take a shovel and remove as much snow as possible around the tires and the sides of your vehicle. Try to also dig a path in the direction you want your vehicle to go. Scrape your windshields last. If you don’t have a traditional scraper, use a credit card or CD case to help remove ice that hasn’t already thawed.


If you don’t have an ice scraper with a brush to remove the snow from your car, use the branch of an evergreen tree or a newspaper (whatever you can find) to sweep it off.
If you don’t have a shovel, use what’s available to you, such as a hubcap or a Frisbee in the trunk., To get your car unstuck, turn your wheels side to side a couple of times to push any remaining snow out of the way. If you have all-wheel or 4-wheel drive, make sure it’s engaged. Shift into forward (or the lowest gear possible on a standard), gently press the gas and ease forward; even a couple of inches is good. Then shift into reverse and gently press the gas to rock backward. Repeat this process until you hopefully get enough traction to pull out and keep going.


If your tires start spinning, let up on the gas immediately because you’ll only dig yourself in deeper by spinning the tires.
Have a passenger stand outside the vehicle, hold onto the inside of the driver’s window and help push.
Never let anyone stand behind the vehicle and push because the car could slide back and cause serious injury.
If you don’t get anywhere with this, look for traction elsewhere. If you have cat litter, salt or sand, spread some around either your front or back tires, depending upon whether you have a front-wheel or rear-wheel drive vehicle. If it’s an all-wheel or 4-wheel drive vehicle, spread it by all four tires.
If you don’t have these materials, use your car mats, small rocks or pebbles, pine combs, twigs or small branches as traction., If a snowstorm is just beginning and you are unable to dislodge your vehicle, try to get help by flagging other drivers and by calling authorities. The situation will likely only get worse. Keep in mind, however, that distances are greatly distorted by blowing snow. What seems near is often much further away. Thus, leaving your vehicle is only advised if help is assured and in clear and certain sight. Otherwise, you have a much higher chance of surviving the storm by using your vehicle as your shelter., If you are unable to move, or unsuccessful in getting your vehicle out, stay where you are. A car is pretty good shelter. A person can only survive without shelter for three hours in freezing temperatures.


Unless you can see a building close by that you know you can take shelter in or if help is in sight, do not leave.
Remember that distances become distorted by falling and blowing snow.
Additionally, snow covers holes, sharp objects and other hazardous objects, so heading out on foot is a serious risk in the midst of a storm., Typically, most people now have a cellphone that they carry with them at all times. Before your cellphone’s battery dies, pinpoint your precise location using your vehicle or phone’s GPS, call 911 and tell them where you are stuck and who is in the vehicle. Make sure to also include other relevant information, such as how much water and food you have, how much gas you have and if someone in the vehicle has a serious medical condition.If you have enough charge left in your phone, make one short phone call to someone you think is not also stuck and who will advocate on your behalf with authorities to ensure you are rescued, if it comes to that. Make sure you tell them your location.
Use your phone's charge wisely. If you are in your car for days, you may have to turn off your cellphone when you are done to save any remaining battery charge for later emergency use. But turning it off also means you will not get any incoming calls or texts.
If you turn on your vehicle periodically, you can also charge your phone as it takes relatively little drain on the battery.

, When a major storm hits, sometimes thousands of people can no longer get anywhere in their vehicles. Some choose to abandon their vehicles; others stay. Since emergency personnel will make rescuing people occupied cars their priority, you need to make it clear that you are still in your vehicle. First put on your tall, waterproof boots over your pants, and put on a hat, scarf, gloves and heavy coat so you don’t get wet, which you want to avoid at all costs if possible. Getting wet in freezing temperatures will drop your body temperature quickly and put you at risk of hypothermia.


Tie the red piece of fabric to your vehicle’s antenna as a sign to rescuers. If you don't have an antenna, find a spot high on your vehicle where it can blow in the wind or tie it to the door handle facing the direction from which help is most likely to arrive.
If you don’t have a red piece of fabric, find something in your vehicle to use. Responders will recognize this as a sign that you’re in need of assistance.
If stranded in a remote area, stomp out “HELP” or “SOS” very largely in the snow to make yourself visible to those searching by air. If you have access to sticks or tree branches, use them to fill in your letters. You may need to do this again when it stops snowing.
Honk your horn using Morse code for SOS, but ONLY when your vehicle is running to conserve your battery. Do three short honks, three long honks, three short honks, pause for 10-15 seconds and repeat.
Raise the hood of your vehicle after the snow has stopped falling to indicate to rescuers that you need help.
Take turns staying awake to be on the lookout for help!, Even if you’ve already unclogged your exhaust pipe while trying to get your vehicle unstuck, you’ll need to do it more than once if it continues to snow and you are able to periodically run your vehicle’s engine. Carbon monoxide poisoning can make a person sick or cause a person to die through both prolonged and shorter but intense periods of exposure. The early symptoms are nausea, headaches and dizziness., The length of time you might be trapped in your vehicle depends upon a number of factors, such as the severity of the storm, where you’re located, the capabilities of emergency responders and how many others are stranded. It’s extremely important, therefore, to use your vehicle’s gas as little as possible. If help does not arrive and you are in a remote area, you may need gas to evacuate when the storm passes.


If you have a relatively full tank of gas, run the engine every hour for 10 minutes. While you’re doing this, crack one window to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning.
If you don’t have much gas, only run your engine 1-2 times per day for 10 minutes so your battery doesn’t die and your fuel line doesn’t freeze. Use the sun’s heat to your advantage in this instance and run your engine at night, which will also help warm you., You’ll have a limited amount of energy and will need to balance your needs with your supply. Your primary source of energy will be your vehicle’s gas, which then provides the energy for your interior lights, headlights, flashers, etc. If prepared, you’ll also have flashlights, matches, candles, batteries and a radio. To conserve, use one, possibly two, energy sources at a time. For example, don’t use a flashlight while a candle is lit to melt snow for water. Make sure you always turn off anything using a battery after you’re done with it., To preserve the heat your body produces, you want to layer up as much as possible, trapping in the heat. Ideally, each person will have an extra dry layer of clothes and socks to put under a warm coat, with a hat, scarf and gloves. If not, tuck your socks into your pants and your shirt into your gloves, if you have them. Trap in heat however you can. If you have a knife or another instrument like a screwdriver, sharp pen, or a piece of plastic or metal ripped from your car, cut the cloth from your seats, floorboard or roof and wrap up in it for insulation. Utilize the floor mats however you can, too.


Crumble up and put road maps, paperwork from your glove compartment, newspaper, paper towels or napkins, etc. under your clothes for insulation.
Use the wool blankets you stocked up on to warm yourself.
Ration your hand warmers, but use them strategically. Put them in your gloves and pockets when needed, but also put them in your socks, under your hat by your ears and so forth., Remember, your vehicle is your shelter, or home. Just as you insulate your home to protect you from winter weather and close the doors in your den when you get a roaring fire going, you want to keep the cold out and keep the heat in your vehicle. First, reducing the size of the space inside your vehicle will help with this. If you have an extra blanket and a large SUV, for example, tape the blanket from the roof down behind the backseat to seal off the area behind it. Tape newspaper to the windows to insulate them.If you don’t have a blanket to block unused space, use whatever material is at your disposal. You could cut out the seat cushions, for example, and lodge them in strategic locations to reduce the space in your vehicle.
If you don’t have newspaper to insulate the windows, look around you. Do you have magazines, paper towels or napkins, your child’s textbook? You could also use the floor mats. If you don’t have tape, do you have band-aids, gum, nail glue?

, If you’re not alone, the person next to you is far warmer than anything around! He or she may be madly shivering, but 97 or 98 degrees is still dozens of degrees higher than everything around you. And together, particularly in smaller spaces, you can actually increase the amount of heat in that area by huddling together. Create a cocoon around yourselves with your blankets, coats or whatever it is you’ve found to stay warm., Movement increases your circulation, which creates energy that helps keep you warm. In fact, your body puts out 5-10 times more heat when it’s actively exerting itself. In a situation such as this, particularly if you don’t have food to replenish your system, too much exercise is both impractical and unwise. Nonetheless, you still need to keep moving some. When you’re sitting, move your hands and feet in circles, flex your fingers and toes and do arm and leg stretches., You need to drink about 5 ounces of fluids an hour to avoid dehydration. That’s roughly equivalent to filling a standard coffee mug half full, or about one third of a water bottle. You should also eat a small snack every hour or so to help supply your body with energy to produce heat. Use your watch, rather than your cellphone or a clock in your vehicle that relies on your vehicle’s battery, to keep track of the time. If you don’t have a watch, try to gauge the time by observing the sun as it moves through the sky.


Avoid caffeine and alcohol. They both, in their own ways, speed up the bad effects cold weather has on your body even if one or the other may seem to help.
Your goal is to regulate your body’s temperature, fluid levels and blood sugar levels as much as possible and to make your supplies last., Because you have a limited number of water bottles or do not have fluids at all, you’ll need to melt snow. First, however, never eat snow, no matter how thirsty you are. It can lower your body temperature to dangerous levels. If you’ve prepared in advance, you have a coffee can, waterproof matches and a couple of candles. To melt snow, fill the can loosely about ½ to ¾ full and light either a couple of matches or a candle to hold underneath the can. Don’t pack the snow into the can.


Make sure to crack a window while you’re doing this because even small candles and matches can produce carbon monoxide.
If you don’t have these supplies, look around you. What’s metal or plastic that can be emptied or pried apart and used to collect and put snow in, such as a plastic bag from the grocery store or even your glove compartment?
When you turn your vehicle on, direct the vents toward the snow to melt it. If you’re out of gas, put smaller amounts of snow in your container and set it in the sun or a warmer spot in the car to melt.

, Water bottles can be stored in your cooler. If you don’t have a cooler but do have bottles, wrap them in a blanket or another kind of material for insulation. Extra melted snow can be stored in empty water bottles, or whatever you have on hand. If your water gets too slushy, place it in the sun or near a heating vent when you turn on the engine. You can also store water in an airtight container and bury it about a foot beneath the snow. Even when the air above ground is freezing, the air trapped in the snow provides insulation and will help prevent the water from freezing., Remember, you can survive in freezing temperatures without food for up to three weeks as long as you’re adequately hydrated and have proper shelter. It won’t be fun, but you can only survive three hours in freezing temperatures without shelter. Check your vehicle thoroughly for food you might not think you have, such as an old breakfast bar that might have become stuck between the seats or sugar packets you might have in your purse from lunch last week.


If you find something, don’t devour it no matter how hungry you are. Eat only a small amount at a time and chew it slowly. This will make it feel as if you’ve eaten more.
If you suspect someone with you has hypothermia and isn’t thinking clearly, take extra precautions if he or she is also hungry. Don’t let them leave the vehicle in search of food., If you’re still stranded when the storm clears, you’ll need to make a decision about when and how you will leave. Much of this will depend upon your location, how long you’ve been trapped and how well you’re doing physically. If you have a wind-up or transistor radio or enough gas left to listen to the radio, try to determine the road conditions and if certain roads are blocked.


Talk to others if you’ve been stranded on a highway, for instance. If you still have charge on your cellphone, call a friend or relative to seek assistance and to ask what’s being done to clear the roads and/or find you., If you’re in a city or on a highway where others are stranded, you have a high chance of being rescued once the weather settles and emergency personnel are able to maneuver more easily. Nonetheless, if there are a lot of people also stranded, it could take a long time, time you may not have. If you decide to walk in search of safety, go with others if possible. Leave a note in your vehicle stating where you are going and stick to the plan, so rescuers or loved ones will be able to find you if they locate your vehicle first. Wear multiple layers and bring as many supplies as you can without becoming overloaded.


If you have enough gas left and think you can avoid becoming stuck again, try to dislodge your vehicle.
If you choose to stay with your vehicle, make sure it’s obvious to rescuers that you are still with your vehicle.

, Very cold weather puts added strain on a person’s heart, and activities like shoveling snow, pushing a car and trudging through snow-covered terrain for long distances can cause heart attacks or make other health conditions considerably worse. If you’re in a remote area, are in relatively good health and believe you have enough gas to reach a gas station, a hotel or the like, consider digging your vehicle out of the snow. If you don’t have enough gas, you will need to make a choice – attempt to walk to safety or do everything you can to make yourself visible to rescuers.


If you stay, stamp out SOS in the snow again and lay branches in the letters. Use a CD or break off one of the mirrors from your car to sweep the horizon frequently. This will bounce off the sun, and air rescuers will recognize it as a signal.
If you can get a fire started now that the snow has stopped, start one and keep it going – particularly at night – for warmth and to signal rescuers.If you decide to walk, leave a note indicating where you’re headed and, again, stick to the plan. Layer up, bring as many of your supplies with you as possible, make sure you leave in the early morning and take frequent breaks to rest and to drink and eat something."

Get medical care if necessary.",How to Survive a Volcanic Eruption," If you live near a volcano, your community likely has a plan in place to warn people that the volcano may erupt. In many cases sirens are used to alert people that danger is eminent. Local radio stations will also broadcast important advisories. Since each region is a little different, it's important to know the specific warning procedures in your area.As soon as you hear a siren, turn on the radio to find out what the local emergency management agency advises. You may be told to stay indoors, keep away from certain areas, or, in extreme cases, evacuate.
If you don't live in the area, and you're just traveling through, you should still be familiar with the region's warning system so you'll know what it means when you hear it.;
, If you live near a well-researched and well-monitored volcano, you can probably obtain a hazard-zone map from your local emergency management agency or, in the U.S., from the U.S. Geological Survey. These maps show the probable paths of lava flows and lahar (or mud flows) and give estimates for the minimum time it would take a flow to reach a given location. They also divide the area around the volcano into zones, from high-risk to low-risk.


Using this information you can get some idea of how safe your house or workplace is, and you can plan the best route of escape.
Because volcanic eruptions are complex and, to some extent, unpredictable, you should have several alternative routes to reach one or more “safe zones.”

, Figure out what you'll need to do if you hear the sirens go off. Map out exactly where your family will go, and figure out the safest way to get there. Keep in mind that if the sky is filled with ash, you won't be able to travel far by car, since ash interferes with mechanisms in car engines and prevents them from operating correctly.


Talk with each of your family members about the evacuation plan. Make sure everyone knows exactly what to do and where to meet. Don't forget to include your pets in your evacuation plan.
It's a good idea to have a checklist you can run down so you make sure you don't forget anyone or anything in the heat of the moment. Include a list of the people and animals that should be present, the possessions you'll take with you, and fast actions you might take to seal up your house to prevent as much damage as possible.

, Store at least a three-day supply of food and portable water at your home. In the event of an eruption, water supplies may become contaminated, so you can’t count on your well or public water. Keep all your supplies in one place—a large container that you can carry, for example—so that you can quickly bring them with you if you need to evacuate. In addition to food and water, stock up on the following:


A first aid kit
Blankets and warm clothing
A battery-powered radio and fresh batteries so that you will be able to listen to advisories if the power goes out
Necessary medications
A map of the region

, If you will be visiting a volcano, knowledge is your most important protection. Before going to the volcano, consult with local authorities, and heed their recommendations or warnings. Learn about the hazards you may encounter in the area of the volcano, and get a reputable guide to accompany you, if possible.


If you're going to be climbing or hiking near the volcano, you should bring a few survival items that will help you survive if you're caught outside without access to shelter. You'll need a respirator and goggles to protect your face and help you breathe. Bring long pants and long-sleeved shirts.
Bring plenty of water in case you become unexpectedly trapped by a lava flow, and don’t overexert yourself. You’ll be able to react more quickly—and run for your life, if necessary—if you’re not fatigued.

, When a volcano erupts, immediately tune in to determine if you are in immediate danger where you are and also to find out what is happening around you. These advisories will be your “eyes” to see the larger picture and help you assess the situation and make the right decisions.


The sirens will most likely be your first warning that an eruption is occurring, but you might receive other indications that something is amiss. If you see a plume of debris rising from the volcano, or if you feel an earthquake, tune in immediately.
Make sure your battery-operated radio is in working order in case the power goes out. It's an important way to stay connected and learn about updates that can affect your safety.

, In most cases you'll be told to stay inside, but you may be ordered to evacuate. It's extremely important to follow the advisories, whatever they may be, in order to ensure your family's safety. Most importantly, if you're told to evacuate, do it right away. Conversely, if you are not instructed to evacuate the area, stay where you are unless you can see immediate danger. Taking to the roads may be more hazardous than staying at home.


In recent eruptions, many people have been killed because they did not heed an evacuation order. If you are lucky enough to get advance warning, use it wisely instead of trying to hold your ground.
It's also important to evacuate the area as soon as possible after being told to do so. If you wait to long, you'll have to deal with ash fall, which will muck up your car's engine and make it more difficult to leave.

, Unless you need to evacuate, the safest place you can be is inside a strong structure. Close all the windows and doors to protect yourself from ash and burning cinders.Make sure all of your family members are inside, and that your emergency supply of food and water is indoors with you.


If you own livestock, bring them inside their shelter and close the doors and windows.
If you have time, protect machinery by putting it inside a garage.

, Lava flows, laggards, mudflows, and flooding are common in a major eruption. All of these can be deadly, and all of them tend to travel in valleys and low-lying areas. Climb to higher ground, and stay there until you can confirm that the danger has passed.

, While you want to get to higher ground, you should also try to shield yourself from pyroclastics, which are rocks and debris (sometimes red-hot) that are sent flying during an eruption. The most important thing to do is watch out for them and get out of their range. Sometimes they actually rain down, and in some types of eruptions, such as that which occurred at Mount St. Helens in 1980, they can land miles from the volcano’s crater.


Protect yourself by staying below the ridgelines of hills and on the side of the hill opposite the volcano.
If you are caught in a hail of smaller pyroclastics, crouch down on the ground, facing away from the volcano, and protect your head with your arms, a backpack, or anything else you can find.

, Volcanoes emit a number of gases, and if you are close to one when it erupts, these gases could be deadly. Breathe through a respirator, mask, or moist piece of cloth—this will also protect your lungs from clouds of ash—and try to get away from the volcano as quickly as possible.


Do not stay low to the ground, as some of the most dangerous gases are heavier than air and accumulate near the ground.
Protect your eyes as well. Wear goggles if your mask doesn't cover your eyes.
Keep your skin covered with long pants and a long-sleeved shirt.

, Hot spots, geysers, and mudpots are common on volcanoes. The ground around these is typically very thin, and a fall through could result in serious burns or death. Never try to cross these during an eruption, and otherwise cross them only on safe, marked paths.


Mudflows and flooding following an eruption generally kill far more people than pyroclastics or lava. You can be in danger even many miles from the volcano. Never try to cross a lava flow or lahar.
Even flows that appear to be cooled may simply have formed a thin crust over a core of extremely hot lava. If you do cross a lava flow, you run the risk of being trapped between flows if another suddenly develops.

, Keep the radio on and stay inside until you learn the danger has passed and you're free to go outside. Even after the eruption is over, you might be advised to stay inside until the ash stops falling. If you do go outside before it's deemed safe, make sure your body is covered from head to toe and that you breathe through a respirator or moistened cloth.


Drink only bottled water until the tap water is said to be clean. If you see ash in any water source, avoid drinking it.If the ash falls for many hours, officials might advise evacuating, even after the eruption is over. That's because ash is so heavy that it can cause roofs to collapse, creating dangerous situations for people staying indoors.

, Volcanic ash is comprised of tiny glass-like particles that are harmful to the lungs. Don't walk or drive in areas close to the volcano where a lot of ash has collected. Turn on the radio to find out which areas were most severely affected.


Keeping away from ash especially important for people with respiratory conditions like asthma or bronchitis.
Don't drive through areas with heavy ash fall, either. The ash will clog up your engine and ruin it., When you're sure it's safe to go out, you'll need to clear the ash from your rooftop and other areas. Ash is very heavy and can cause roofs to collapse, especially when it's wet. If wind stirs it up, it will be harmful to those who breathe it in.Wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, and cover your mouth with a mask so you don't breathe in the ash. You might also want to wear goggles.
Shovel the ash into trash bags, then seal them and dispose of them according to your community's recommendations.
Don't turn your air conditioner on or open your vents back up until most of the ash has been cleared away.

, Receive medical treatment promptly for burns, injuries, and gas or ash inhalation. Once you are safe, waste no time getting treatment or an examination. Keep in mind, however, that you may need to wait a while if there are people with more serious injuries."
"
Stay inside the car if possible.,
Don’t touch the inside of the car.,
Call 911.,
Warn people not to touch the car or power line.,
Follow the police’s directions.",How to React if a Power Line Falls on Your Car1," Unless your car is on fire, it’s very important to stay inside your car once a power line falls. When a power line falls on your car, it often charges the metal parts of the car with electrical current, meaning that if you attempt to exit as you normally do, you will be electrocuted.After the line falls, look around the inside of your car and out the windows. If you don’t see flames or smoke, you aren’t in any immediate danger. The safest thing you can do is to stay inside.
If you see flames and smoke, refer to Method 2 for instructions on safely evacuating the car.
If there are other passengers in the car, communicate with them that the safest thing to do is to stay inside the car. Even one person exiting the car incorrectly could put you all in danger of electrocution.;
, Sit still in your car with your hands in your lap. Take extra care not to touch the frame of your car, which is very possibly charged with electrical current.As long as you stay still and don’t touch the frame of your car, you are safe inside your car.

, Use your cell phone to call 911. Give them your address, and tell that that a power line fell on your car. They will likely give you some advice such as staying inside the car, but if they give you specific pieces of advice make sure to follow them., If you notice cars coming behind you or approaching the power line from the opposite lane, honk your horn to signal to them that they should not get near the line.If anyone gets out of their car to investigate or try to help you, shout over to them that they should not touch your car or get anywhere near the fallen power line.
If you don’t have your cell phone on you and weren’t able to dial 911, ask anyone who approaches if they will call 911 for you. Do not have them hand you the phone; instead, tell them to call 911, explain the situation, and provide the address of the downed line.

, Once the dispatchers arrive to the scene, they will approach the car and possibly ask questions or give you instructions. Follow whatever advice they give you, as they will be able to assess your individual situation. Only exit the car after they tell you that the power to the line is out and grounded, and it is safe to get out of your vehicle."

Run away whenever possible.,
Know the escape routes.,
React immediately.,
Forget your belongings.,
Run directly to the exit.,
Bring people with you.,
Grab a weapon only if convenient.,
If you have to fight, close distance is your friend.",How to Survive a School or Workplace Shooting1," Your best chance to survive the shooting is to get out of the area as fast as possible.Only rule this out if the only escape routes would put you in sight of the shooter.;
, Prepare in advance by identifying all exits from the rooms where you spend the most time. This includes emergency exits, fire escapes, and windows. Ideally, plan at least two escape routes out of the school or workplace, in case the shooter is blocking one of them.Don't rule out second story windows, or windows that you would have to break. You can survive cuts from broken glass, or a broken leg from a fall.
98% of shooters act alone. If you can avoid the area where you hear gunfire, you are usually safe.

, Don't freeze up or waste time debating your options. Find an escape route, and start running. If you hear gunshots in the distance, you can likely get out of the area before the shooter arrives.


If you have shoes that prevent you from running, take them off.

, If you've determined that it's best to run, then forget your wallet, your purse, or your cell phone. Though your first instinct may be to take your possessions with you, none of them are as important as your life.

, Do not slow yourself down with evasive maneuvers, such as running in a zig-zag or bending over as you run.Run as fast as you can, directly to safety. These tactics only matter if the shooter is aiming directly at you, and using a weapon with a low rate of fire. Getting away fast is usually the better option.


The one exception is a situation where you are forced to run within sight of the shooter, in an area with plenty of cover between you and the exit. In this case, running from obstacle to obstacle may be your best chance. See the section on hiding for advice on finding cover that will stop a bullet.

, As you're running, encourage others to run. If someone looks disoriented or too scared to move, grab that person and drag him with you. Tell the people that running is crucial to their survival. If you're running in a bigger group, it'll be harder to target you individually, and you'll have strength in numbers if you do run up against the shooter.

, If you happen to see a sharp object, or a blunt object you can carry while running, grab it. Do not waste time looking for one of these when you could be running. This is only for a last case scenario when you are unable to escape the shooters.

, Get as close as you can without being noticed. Grab the barrel with 1 hand and cover the ejection port with the other (try to to keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction). The shooter will pull the trigger and the gun will fire, but only once because the hand covering the ejection port will cause a malfunction and the weapon will not cycle another round. That weapon is now a useless hunk of metal until the shooter can clear and cycle another round in manually (perfect opportunity for you to take the weapon away and subdue the shooter).

Open the door.,
Bring your legs together and cross your arms.,
Jump out of the car.,
Shuffle or hop away from your car.,
Call 911 when you are 50 feet (15.2 m) away.",How to React if a Power Line Falls on Your Car2," Evacuating your car is risky, so you want to be 100% sure that your car is on fire before exiting. If you see smoke but no flames, watch the smoke to make sure that it isn’t exhaust coming from your car. Smoke is thick and won’t dissipate quickly, whereas exhaust will fade into the air.


If you see flames, your car is definitely on fire and you should evacuate as quickly and carefully as you can.

, Once you see that your car is on fire, it’s important to exit as quickly as you can. Open the latch of the door and push it open, being careful to only touch the plastic latch and not the frame of the door or car.The metal frame of the car is likely charged with electricity by the power line, so it’s important to have as little contact with your car as possible in order to avoid getting electrocuted.

, After you open the door to the car, don’t step out as you normally would. Instead, hold your legs together and bring them slightly inward towards your body. Rotate your body, making sure to not let your feet or any other part of your body touch the frame of the car, so that you are angled to jump out of the car.Cross your arms over your body to make yourself as small and compact as possible.

, Still keeping your legs together, jump carefully out of the car and land on both of your feet at the same time. Keeping your legs together so that your feet touch the ground at the same time greatly reduces your chances of getting shocked.Jump, don’t slide, out of the car. Your body should be in the air, not sitting in the car, when your feet touch the ground.

, After you jump out of your car, get away from the flaming car as fast as you can. Instead of walking and lifting up one foot at a time, shuffle from the car, keeping both your feet on the ground at all times about 6 inches (15 cm) apart. Alternatively, you could also hop away from your car.You may feel silly, but shuffling or hopping may save you from getting shocked.
If you choose to hop from the car, make sure that both of your feet hit the ground at the same time.

, Keep shuffling or hopping until you are at least 50 feet (15.2 m) from your car. Then take out your phone and call 911. Tell them your exact location, and let them know that a power line has fallen onto your car and that your car has caught fire.When the dispatchers arrive, tell them what is going on and follow their safety advice.
Warn other approaching cars what has happened, and tell them not to approach or touch the car or the power line. Shout over to them if they are within 50 feet (15.2 m) of the power line or car.

"
"
Do not approach the power line or car.,
Yell over to the person in the vehicle.,
Call 911.,
Stay until the dispatchers arrive.",How to React if a Power Line Falls on Your Car3," If you are a bystander to a power line falling on someone else's car, or come back to see that a power line has fallen on your car, do not approach within 50 feet (15.2) of the power line. Getting close to the scene is extremely dangerous, and there are ways that you can help without getting hurt., If you witness a power line fall on someone else's car, instead of approaching the vehicle, yell to the person in the car. Ask them if they are okay, and tell them to avoid touching the frame or interior of the car.Say something like, ""Hello, are you okay?"" When they respond, and if their car isn't on fire, yell over, ""I know what to do in this situation. Stay in your car and try not to touch the frame of the car or any metal parts of your car, since they can be charged with electricity. I'm calling 911 right now, so help will be here soon. As long as you stay in your car, you'll be fine!""
If their car is on fire, say, ""Your car is on fire, so you need to get out quickly and carefully! Turn slowly toward the door of your car without touching the frame of the car. Open the door handle without touching any other part of the door. Swing it open, then jump out so that you land on both feet. Shuffle away from the car, and keep both feet on the ground at all times. I'm calling 911 right now, so just focus on getting out of the car carefully!""
Be reassuring and let them know that you know what to do. Let them know that as long as they follow your instructions, they will be safe and unhurt.
Also let any approaching cars or pedestrians know what has happened and warn them not to get within 50 feet of the line.

, If you haven't already, yell over to the person in the car that you are calling 911. If they want you to call for them or are unresponsive, dial 911 and tell the respondents the situation and location. If you come back to your car to see that a power line has fallen on it, call 911 so that they can deactivate the line and make your car safe to drive again., Stay at the scene until the dispatchers arrive. If you have just witnessed a power line fall on someone's car, it will make the occupant of the car feel better to know that they have someone outside who is handling the situation. Once the dispatchers arrive, explain the situation to them again. If the power line fell on your car, follow their instructions until the car is safe to approach again.If the power line fell on your car, you will likely will have to call a towing company or mechanic to get your car taken away and fixed unless it is only superficially damaged.

"
Choose this course of action if running is impossible.,
Split tasks with other people in the room.,
Turn off the lights.,
Lock and barricade the door.,
Call 9-1-1.,
Grab any weapons you can find.,
Find cover.,
Find concealment if cover is not available.,
Turn off anything that makes noise.,
Try to stay calm.,
Play dead as a last resort.",How to Survive a School or Workplace Shooting2," It should only take a few seconds to determine if running is a possibility. If the shooter is rapidly approaching your room, or if he is blocking the only escape route, start hiding or barricading yourself in immediately.


Hiding is the second option because it traps you in one area. However, most mass shooting events are over within ten or fifteen minutes. If you can avoid the shooter for that long, you have a good chance at surviving., If there are other people in the room, get their attention and assign them to the following tasks (each described in more detail below):


One person should call 9-1-1 (or the emergency number in your region).
One group of people should lock and barricade the door.
One group of people should grab anything that could be used as a weapon.

, Immediately turn off the lights in the room where you are. This will make the shooter less likely to enter the room, and slightly increase your chance of survival if he does.

, Lock the door immediately and do anything you can to make it more difficult for the shooter to enter. Remember that most shooters only have a few minutes before the police show up, and they're not interested in taking the path of most resistance. Lock the door, place a doorstop on it, and place all heavy furniture like desks and chairs in front of the door immediately to deter the shooter.


If the shooter is approaching, get away from the door as soon as you can. Stay away from all doors and windows.
If the door opens to the outside, a barricade will only delay the shooter for a moment. Building one may not be worth wasting time and blocking a potential escape route.
If you're in a bathroom that doesn't lock, loop a belt or T-shirt around the arms of the door butler (the metal hinge on top of the door that allows it to open).

, A mass shooting typically continues for five minutes before anyone calls the police. If you have other people in the room to barricade the door, calling immediately can be a big help. Once they've been called, law enforcement typically arrives within three minutes.Use a landline instead of your cell phone if possible, so the police can automatically trace the call.
If you can't reach an emergency service, look for a ceiling sprinkler system and try to set it off by holding a lighter underneath the detector. This should automatically call the fire department.

, Look around the room where you're hiding and find anything that you can use as a weapon. It can be a stapler or sharp scissors you find on the teacher's desk, the hot coffee in the kitchen of your office, beakers or dangerous acids (such as sulphuric) in a science room, or anything that is sharp, heavy, made of glass, or which can be used as a weapon. Hold on to these weapons if the shooter enters the room where you are.


Even small thrown objects can delay a gunman if a large group of people work together. While this is obviously a last resort, anyone who can't find a weapon should grab something to throw., The term cover refers to barriers that will stop a bullet. Brick or concrete walls, steel building support beams, or thick trees are the most common examples.If you are trapped in a single room, your best option is a thick piece of furniture such as a heavy desk or filing cabinet.


Ideally, find a spot that does not restrict your movement. If the situation changes, you want to be able to run to an exit as fast as possible.

, Concealment hides you from the shooter's line of sight, but will not protect you from gunfire. If it's your only option, hide behind furniture, in closets, or in any other hiding spot. Crouch low to the ground to minimize the chance that a stray bullet hits you.


Most interior walls will not stop a bullet.

, If you have time, silence your cell phone and other electronics so the sound won't encourage the shooter to approach you.

, Though this may seem nearly impossible, it's crucial that you remain absolutely silent. Tell people that whimpering or crying will only make the shooter more likely to find you. Be mentally prepared for the event that the shooter comes into the room and finds you. In that case, you'll have no choice but to fight, as described below.

, People have survived mass shootings by playing dead in areas where shots have been fired.However, some shooters are aware of this tactic and will target bodies.The only time you should try this is when both running and hiding are impossible.

"
"
Remember that attacking the shooter is your final option.,
Do not try to reason with the shooter or plead for your life.,
Work with others to create confusion.,
Attack the shooter with any weapon you can.,
Aim high.,
Commit to the attack.",How to Survive a School or Workplace Shooting3," You shouldn't jump out of your hiding place and attack the shooter if he's approaching. You should only fight him if you're sure that you'll be shot if you do nothing.

, Trying to engage with the shooter, ask him what he's doing, or to plead for your life by talking about your family has not been proven effective in dealing with shooters. Don't waste your time by trying to talk to him -- you're much better off fighting.

, If you are in a group of people and cannot avoid the shooter, your best chance is to create as much noise and movement as possible. Shouting, throwing objects, and running will buy you a few extra seconds to leave the room, or to attack the shooter if there is no escape route.

, Use scissors, glass, or any other sharp or heavy objects to attack the shooter as soon as you are in close proximity. Even a sharp ballpoint pen is better than nothing. You're fighting for your life and every second counts.


Once again, this is an absolute last resort. Most shooters are heavily armed, and some wear body armor. Even if you have a gun of your own, you are most likely at a disadvantage.

, Try to hurt the shooter in the face, eyes, shoulders, or neck, or arms, so that he's more likely to let go of his weapon. You should stab him in the neck, gouge out his eyes, or stab him in the arm -- doing anything you can to make him get rid of that weapon or to hurt him so the weapon is within your reach.


Kick him in the crotch. If you can't go for his face or weapon, kick him in the crotch. This will be an effective way to disarm him and to cause him a large amount of pain.

, Once you are in this situation, hesitation or panic can be fatal. Be as aggressive as possible, attacking with anything you can. Do not try to run or stop fighting, even if you are shot in the leg or arm.

"
"
Report any suspicious activity.,
Be aware of your school or workplace's lockdown procedure.,
Be prepared for a shooting.",How to Survive a School or Workplace Shooting4," Keep alert and always report suspicious incidents to the authorities. If a student or co-worker talks about killing people or threatens to bring a knife or a gun to school, report this to a teacher or law enforcement. You may prevent a disaster by doing so. Many shooters often announce their plans ahead of schedule as a way of showing off; do not take their behavior lightly or as a joke and report it immediately. , Every school and office has some kind of lockdown procedure that stipulates how doors should be locked, where people should hide, and how the authorities should be called, so if you'd like to be prepared for a shooting, be familiar with your workplace's standard procedure when it comes to shootings. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to follow the protocol exactly in the event of a shooting, but knowing what it is can help you react in the most helpful way possible.

, Though you should not bring a weapon to school or to the workplace just in case there is a shooting, if you'd really like to be prepared, you should take self-defense classes or other classes that teach you how to fight off an attacker in the event of an attack or shooting. Knowing a few fighting tricks can help you feel more confident if you have no choice but to attack a shooter.

"
"
Do not run to law enforcement.,
Keep your hands up.,
Tell the police what you know.,
Move in the direction the police came from.,
Obey police instructions immediately.",How to Survive a School or Workplace Shooting5," The first people to arrive are there to locate and deal with the shooter, not to rescue people. Do not leave a hiding spot, and do not get in their way.


If you are wounded, wait for a paramedic or firefighter.

, When you are within sight of the police, raise your hands and spread your fingers to show you are not a threat. Keep your hands visible at all times.

, If you have any information on the shooter's location or type of weaponry, let the nearest officer know.

, Don't stop to ask police for directions. If it's safe to move, run in the direction the police came from, keeping your hands raised and visible.

, Do so as fast as possible and without argument.

Take preventative measures as you would for a nuclear fallout..,
Add plastic sheeting, duct tape, and scissors to your disaster supplies kit if not already present.,
Know the different variables of an RDD strike.,
Assume radiological contamination has occurred and take the proper precautions.,
Breathe through the cloth of your shirt or coat to help filter out dust or other contaminants in the air.,
Seek shelter indoors immediately in the nearest undamaged building if you are outside.,
Limit infiltration of radioactive particles.,
Listen for official instructions and follow directions.,
Stay calm and help spread the word.,
Save your potassium iodide pills for larger nuclear fallout.,
Decontaminate yourself if you have been exposed to radioactive material.,
Use a plastic bag to seal and dispose of any clothing you were wearing at the time of the blast.,
Seek medical attention after officials indicate it is safe to leave shelter.,
Continue listening to your radio or watch the television for instructions from local officials, whether you have evacuated or sheltered-in-place.",How to Survive a Dirty Bomb (Radiological Dispersion Device)," There is no way of knowing how much warning time there will be before an attack by terrorists using an RDD, so being prepared in advance and knowing what to do and when is important. Here are some important details to consider in advance of a possible detonation of an RDD device:


Do you have enough food to feed you and your family unassisted for 48 hours? Stock up on non-perishable goods such as rice, beans, dried fruits and vegetables, and powdered milk.
Do you have enough water to accommodate yourself and your family? Store enough water to provide at least one gallon per day per individual.
Do you have basic medical needs provided for? Aim to store a first aid kit, a first aid instruction booklet, as well as any emergency prescriptions in a safe place.
Do you have basic communication devices? Flashlights, radios, and whistles may come in handy.;
, These items are extremely versatile and will allow you to improve upon, fashion, or repair a large number of items you may need or come across after the RDD event.

, The size of the affected area and the level of destruction caused by an RDD would depend on the sophistication and size of the conventional bomb, the type of radioactive material used, the quality and quantity of the radioactive material, and the local meteorological conditions—primarily wind and precipitation. Understanding how the different variables affect the size and magnitude of the fallout area will greatly increase your chances of healthy survival.


Many RDD strikes theoretically depend on wind-borne dispersion. Knowing, for example, that the prevailing winds in the Northern U.S. are westerlies — which blow from west to east — is critical if you happen to find yourself downwind of an RDD strike., Particularly in an urban setting or near other likely terrorist targets, this assumption helps keep you prepared and on your toes. As with any radiation, you want to avoid or limit exposure. This is particularly true of inhaling radioactive dust that results from the explosion.


While the explosive blast will be immediately obvious, the presence of radiation will not be known until trained personnel with specialized equipment are on the scene. Whether you are indoors or outdoors, home or at work, be extra cautious.

, The goal here is to improvise when you are left with no other options. This will not safeguard you against all forms of radiation; it will merely limit your exposure.

, If you manage to avoid breathing radioactive dust, your proximity to the radioactive particles may still result in some radiation exposure. If appropriate shelter is not available, move as rapidly as is safe upwind and away from the location of the explosive blast. Then, seek appropriate shelter as soon as possible. Listen for official instructions and follow directions. Remain indoors.

, Turn off ventilation and heating systems. Close windows, vents, fireplace dampers, exhaust fans, and clothes dryer vents. Retrieve your disaster supplies kit and a battery-powered radio and take them to your shelter room, preferably underground or in an interior room of a building, placing as much distance and dense shielding as possible between you and the outdoors where the radioactive material may be.


An interior room on the lowermost level, preferably without windows such as a basement, is the ideal location to stay.
Seal windows and external doors that do not fit snugly with duct tape. Plastic sheeting will not provide shielding from radioactivity nor from blast effects of a nearby explosion, but can help keep radioactive dust from infiltrating your shelter.

, Turn on your radio, surf the web, or interact with members of your family or community in order to gain relevant, accurate information.

, In the event of an RDD strike, the likelihood of serious radiological contamination is extremely low.Even near the epicenter of the blast, radiological dispersion may be weak and will reduce rapidly.Help others near you remain calm. Terrorists using a dirty bomb likely expect widespread panic and social upheaval after a sudden strike. Reacting calmly, logically, and decisively — as well as spreading that message of reason — is a great asset in a time of panic.

, Although potassium iodide pills may be effectively taken in the case of nuclear bombs or nuclear power plant leaks, they are not effective against dirty bombs.In the event of a dirty bomb, move away from the location of the blast as quickly as possible to limit exposure to radiation.


Potassium iodide will only protect you against inhaled or swallowed radioactive isotopes of iodine.It's better to keep them for situations in which their usage becomes truly urgent.

, To do this, remove and bag your clothing (and isolate the bag away from you and others), and shower thoroughly with soap and water.



Do not use conditioner after shampooing your hair. Conditioner helps bind with radioactive materials in your hair and is strongly discouraged in the event of a dirty bomb., Seal up any clothing that may have been contaminated, label it as radioactive, and put it somewhere far away from humans and animals. You may bury it if you properly mark the area and can remember where you put it.

, The likely fallout from a dirty bomb is not anticipated to last longer than several days.

, Do not return to or visit an RDD incident location for any reason.

Be prepared for subsequent attacks.",How to Survive a Nuclear Attack," If a nuclear attack does happen, it won't be safe to venture outside for food — you should stay sheltered for at least 48 hours, preferably longer. Having food and medical supplies on-hand can put your mind at-ease, and allow you to focus on other aspects of survival.;
, Non-perishables can last several years, whether it's in storage or in sustaining you after an attack. Choose items that contain a lot of carbohydrates, so you get more caloric bang for your buck, and store them in a cool, dry place.


White rice
Wheat
Beans
Sugar
Honey
Oats
Pasta
Powdered milk
Dried fruits and vegetables
Build your supply slowly. Every time you go to the grocery store, pick up one or two more items for your food storage. Eventually, you should be able to build up a multi-month supply.
Make sure you have a can opener for canned items.

, Consider keeping a water supply in food-grade plastic containers. Clean the containers with a bleach solution, then fill them with filtered and distilled water.


Aim to have one gallon per person per day.
For purifying water in the event of an attack, keep basic household bleach and potassium iodide (Lugol's solution) on-hand.

, Being able to stay informed, as well as alerting others to your position, can be vitally valuable. Here's what you might need:


A radio: Try to find one that's crank- or solar-powered. If you have to go with a battery-operated model, be sure to keep spare batteries on-hand. Consider getting an NOAA weather radio as well — this will broadcast emergency information 24 hours a day.A whistle: You can use this to signal for help.
Your cell phone: Cell service may or may not be maintained, but you'll want to be ready if it is. If you can, find a solar charger for your model.

, Having a few medical items available could be the difference between life and death if you're injured in the attack. You'll need:


A basic first aid kit: You can purchase these pre-packaged, or make one yourself. You'll need sterile gauze and bandages, antibiotic ointment, latex gloves, scissors, tweezers, a thermometer and a blanket.A first aid instruction booklet: Purchase one from an organization like the Red Cross, or assemble your own with materials you print off from the internet. You should know how to bandage wounds, administer CPR, treat shock, and treat burns.
Prescription medications or supplies: If you take a specific medication every day, try to make sure you have a small emergency supply built-up.

, Round out your emergency preparedness kit with the following:


A flashlight and batteries
Dust masks
Plastic sheeting and duct tape
Garbage bags, plastic ties and wet wipes for personal sanitation
A wrench and pliers, to shut off utilities such as gas and water

, A nuclear attack will unlikely come out of the blue from an enemy nation. Such an attack would likely be preceded by a deteriorating political situation. A war with conventional weapons between nations that both have nuclear weapons, if not ended swiftly, may escalate towards nuclear war; and even limited nuclear strikes in one region carry the likelihood to escalate towards an all-out nuclear war elsewhere.Many countries have a rating system to denote the imminence of attack. In the USA and Canada, for example, it may be useful to know the DEFCON (DEFense CONdition) level.

, If evacuation is not an option, then it should at least affect the kind of shelter you will construct for yourself. Learn your proximity to the following targetsand plan appropriately:


Airfields and naval bases, especially those known to house nuclear bombers, ballistic missile submarines, or ICBM silos. These are certain to be attacked even in a limited nuclear exchange.
Commercial ports and runways over 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) long. These are likely to be attacked even in a limited nuclear exchange, and certain to be attacked in an all-out nuclear war.
Centres of government. These are likely to be attacked even in a limited nuclear exchange and certain to be attacked in an all-out nuclear war.
Large industrial cities and major population centres. These are likely to be attacked in the event of an all-out nuclear war.

,:


Fission (A-Bombs) are the most basic nuclear weapon and are incorporated into the other weapon classes. This bomb's power comes from splitting heavy nuclei (plutonium and uranium) with neutrons; as the uranium or plutonium split each atom releases great amounts of energy - and more neutrons. The daughter neutrons cause an extremely fast nuclear chain reaction. Fission bombs are the only type of nuclear bomb used in war so far. This is the most likely type of bomb to be used by terrorists.
Fusion (H-Bombs), using the incredible heat of a fission bomb 'spark plug', compress and heat deuterium and tritium (isotopes of hydrogen) which fuse, releasing immense amounts of energy. Fusion weapons are also known as thermonuclear weapons since high temperatures are required to fuse deuterium and tritium; such weapons are usually many hundreds of times more powerful than the bombs that destroyed Nagasaki and Hiroshima. The bulk of the US and Russian strategic arsenal are these types of bombs.

, Aside from the geopolitical warning signs, your first warnings of an imminent nuclear attack will most likely be an alarm or warning signal; if not, it will be the blast itself. The bright light from a detonation of a nuclear weapon can be seen tens of miles away from ground zero. If within the vicinity of the blast (or ground zero), your chances of survival are virtually nonexistent unless you are in a shelter that provides a very (VERY) good blast protection. If you are a few miles out, you will have about 10-15 seconds until the heat wave hits you, and maybe 20-30 seconds until the shock wave does. Under no circumstances should you look directly at the fireball. On a clear day, this can cause temporary blindness at very large distances.However, the actual damage radius is highly variable depending on the size of the bomb, the altitude of the explosion, and even the weather conditions at the time of the blast.If you can't find shelter, seek a depressed area nearby and lay face down, exposing as little skin as possible. If there is no shelter of this kind, dig as fast as possible. Even around 8 kilometers (5 miles) you will suffer third degree thermal-burns; still at 32 kilometers (20 miles) the heat can burn the skin off your body. The wind itself will peak at around 960 kilometers per hour (600mph) and will level anything or anybody caught in the open.
Failing the above options, get indoors, if, and only if, you can be sure that the building will not suffer significant blast and heat damage. This will, at least, provide some protection against radiation. Whether this will be a viable option depends on the construction of the building and how close you will be to the likely ground zero of a nuclear strike. Stay well away from any windows, preferably in a room without one; even if the building does not suffer substantial damage, a nuclear explosion will blow out windows at enormous distances. For an example, one (albeit abnormally large) nuclear test in the Novaya Zemlya archipelago in Russia was known to knock out windows in Finland and Sweden.
If residing in Switzerland or Finland, check if your home has an atomic shelter. If not, determine where your village/town/district atomic shelter is and know how to get there. Remember: anywhere in Switzerland, you'll be able to find an atomic shelter. When the sirens sound in Switzerland, you are advised to inform those who may not be able to hear it (e.g. the deaf) and then listen to the National Radio Services (RSR, DRS and/or RTSI).
Don't be surrounded by anything flammable or combustible. Substances like nylon or any oil based material will ignite from the heat.

,


Initial (prompt) radiation. This is radiation released at the moment of detonation, and it is short-lived and travels short distances. With the large yields of modern nuclear weapons, it is thought that this will kill few who would not be killed by the blast or heat at the same distance.Residual radiation. Known as radiation fallout. If the detonation was a surface blast or the fireball hits the earth, large amounts of fallout occurs. The dust and debris kicked into the atmosphere rains down, bringing with it dangerous amounts of radiation. The fallout may rain down as contaminated black soot known as ""black rain,"" which is very fatal and may be of extreme temperature. Fallout will contaminate anything it touches.
Once you have survived the blast and the initial radiation (for now at least; radiation symptoms have an incubation period), you must find protection against the burning black soot.

, Before we continue, we should mention the three different types:


Alpha particles. These are the weakest and, during an attack, are virtually non-existent as a threat. Alpha particles will survive for only a couple inches in the air before they are absorbed by the atmosphere. They possess a minuscule threat from the exterior, however, they will be fatal if ingested or inhaled. Standard clothing will help protect you from Alpha particles.
Beta particles: These are faster than Alpha particles and can penetrate further. They will travel for up to 10 meters (10 yards) before they are absorbed into the atmosphere. Exposure to beta particles is not fatal unless exposed for prolonged periods; which may cause ""Beta burns,"" almost like painful sunburn. They pose a serious threat, however, to the eyes, should they be exposed for a prolonged period. Once again this is harmful if ingested or inhaled, and clothing will help prevent Beta burns.
Gamma rays: Gamma rays are the deadliest. They can travel for nearly a mile in the air and penetrate just about any kind of shielding. Therefore gamma radiation will cause severe damage to the internal organs even as an external source. Sufficient shielding will be required.

A shelter's PF against radiation will tell you how many times less a person inside the shelter will receive radiation compared to open space. For example, RPF 300 means that you will receive 300 times less radiation in the shelter than in the open.
Avoid exposure to Gamma radiation. Try not to spend more than 5 minutes exposed. If you are in a rural area, try finding a cave, or a fallen log into which you can crawl. Otherwise just dig a trench to lie in, with stacked earth around you.



, If in a trench, then create a roof, but only if materials are nearby; don't expose yourself when not necessary. Canvas from a parachute or tent will help stop fallout debris from piling on you, though it will not stop Gamma rays. It is impossible, at a very fundamental physical level, to completely shield from all radiation. It can only be reduced to a tolerable level. Use the following to help you determine the amount of material you'll need to reduce radiation penetration to 1/1000:Steel: 21 cm (0.7 feet)
Rock: 70-100 cm (2-3 ft)
Concrete: 66 cm (2.2 ft)
Wood: 2.6 m (8.8 ft)
Soil: 1 m (3.3 ft)
Ice: 2 m (6.6 ft)
Snow: 6 m (20-22 ft)

, Under no circumstances leave the shelter in the first forty-eight hours.The reason for this is to avoid the ""fission products"" created by a nuclear blast. The most deadly of these is radioactive iodine. Fortunately, radio-iodine has a relatively short half-life of eight days (the time it takes for half to naturally decay into safer isotopes). Keep in mind that even after 8-9 days, there will still be a lot of radio-iodine around so limit your exposure. It may take up to 90 days for the amount of radio-iodine to decay to 0.1% of the initial amount.
The other major products of nuclear fission are Cesium and Strontium. These have longer half lives of 30 years and 28 years respectively. They also are very well absorbed by living things and can make food products dangerous for decades. These materials can be carried by the wind thousands of miles so if think you are safe in a remote area, you are not.

, You will need to ration to survive, obviously; therefore you will eventually expose yourself to the radiation (unless you are in a specific shelter with food and water).


Processed foods are okay to eat, so long as the container has no punctures and is relatively intact.
Animals may be eaten but, they must be skinned carefully with the heart, liver and kidneys discarded. Try not to eat meat that is close to the bone, for bone marrow retains radiation.

How to Eat Wild Rabbit


Plants in a ""hot zone"" are edible; those with edible roots or undergrowth (such as carrots and potatoes) are highly recommended. Use an edibility test on the plants. See How to Test if a Plant Is Edible.
Open water may have received fallout particles and is harmful. Water from an underground source, such as a spring or covered well, is your best bet. (Consider making a basic pit-style solar still, as described in How to Make Water in the Desert.) Use water from streams and lakes only as a last resort. Create a filter by digging a hole about 1 foot from the bank and drawing the water which seeps in. It may be cloudy or muddy so allow the sediments to sit, then boil the water to ensure safety from bacteria. If in a building, the water is usually safe. If there is no water (there most likely won't be), use the water already in the pipes by opening the faucet at the highest point of the house to let in air, then open a faucet at the lowest point of the house to drain the water.

,), especially when outside to help prevent Beta burns. Decontaminate by shaking your clothes constantly and washing, with water, any exposed skin; settled residue will eventually cause burns.

,


Minor burn: Also known as a Beta burn (though it may be from other particles). Immerse Beta burns in cold water until the pain subsides (usually 5 minutes).

If skin starts to blister, char or break; wash it with cold water to remove contaminants, then cover with a sterile compress to prevent infection. Do not break the blisters!

If the skin does not blister, char or break; don't cover it, even if it covers a large portion of the body (almost like sunburn). Instead, wash the area and cover it with Vaseline or a solution of baking powder and water if available. But, moist (uncontaminated) earth will do.


Severe burn: Known as a thermal burn, as it comes mostly from the high intensity blast heat, rather than ionizing particles, though it can be from the latter. This can be life threatening; everything becomes a factor: water loss, shock, lung damage, infection, etc. Follow these steps to treat a severe burn.

Protect burns from further contamination.
If clothing covers the burn area, gently cut and remove the cloth from the burn. DO NOT try to remove cloth which has stuck or fused onto the burn. DO NOT try to pull clothes over the burn. DO NOT put any ointment on the burn. Or better call the Medical Therapy Unit.
Gently wash the burned area with water ONLY. Do NOT apply creams or ointments.
Do NOT use a normal sterile medical dressing not specifically intended for burns. As non-adhesive burn dressings (and all other medical supplies) are likely to be in short supply, an expedient alternative is to use plastic wrap (also known as saran wrap, food wrap, and cling film), which is sterile, does not stick to burns, and is readily available.

Prevent shock. Shock is the inadequate flow of blood to the vital tissues and organs. If untreated, it can be fatal. Shock results from excessive blood loss, deep burns, or reactions to the sight of a wound or blood. The signs are restlessness, thirst, pale skin and rapid heartbeat. Sweating may occur even if the skin feels cool and clammy. As it worsens, they breathe short fast gasps, with a vacant stare. To treat: maintain proper heartbeat and respiration by massaging the chest and positioning the person for adequate respiration. Loosen any constrictive clothing and reassure the person. Be firm yet gentle with self confidence.



, This is not contagious, and everything depends on the amount of radiation one received. Here is a condensed version of the table:

, (Gy (gray) = the SI unit used to measure the absorbed dose of ionizing radiation. 1 Gy = 100 rad. Sv (Sievert) = the SI unit of dose equivalent, 1 Sv = 100 REM. For the purpose of simplification, 1 Gy is usually equivalent to 1 Sv.)


Less than 0.05 Gy: No visible symptoms.
0.05-0.5 Gy: Temporarily decreased red blood cell count.
0.5-1 Gy: Decreased production of immunity cells; susceptible to infections; nausea, headache, and vomiting may be common. This amount of radiation is usually survivable without any medical treatment.
1.5-3 Gy: 35% percent of exposed die within 30 days. (LD 35/30) Nausea, vomiting, and loss of hair all over the body.
3-4 Gy: Severe radiation poisoning, 50% fatality after 30 days (LD 50/30). Other symptoms are similar to the 2–3 Sv dose, with uncontrollable bleeding in the mouth, under the skin and in the kidneys (50% probability at 4 Sv) after the latent phase.
4-6 Gy: Acute radiation poisoning, 60% fatality after 30 days (LD 60/30). Fatality increases from 60% at 4.5 Sv to 90% at 6 Sv (unless there is intense medical care). Symptoms start half an hour to two hours after irradiation and last for up to 2 days. After that, there is a 7 to 14 day latent phase, after which generally the same symptoms appear as with 3-4 Sv irradiation, with increased intensity. Female sterility is common at this point. Convalescence takes several months to a year. The primary causes of death (in general 2 to 12 weeks after irradiation) are infections and internal bleeding.
6-10 Gy: Acute radiation poisoning, near 100% fatality after 14 days (LD 100/14). Survival depends on intense medical care. Bone marrow is nearly or completely destroyed, so a bone marrow transplant is required. Gastric and intestinal tissue are severely damaged. Symptoms start 15 to 30 minutes after irradiation and last for up to 2 days. Subsequently, there is a 5 to 10 day latent phase, after which the person dies of infection or internal bleeding. Recovery would take several years and probably never complete. Devair Alves Ferreira received a dose of approximately 7.0 Sv during the Goiânia accident and survived, partially due to his fractionated exposure.
12-20 REM: Death is 100% at this stage; symptoms appear immediately. The gastrointestinal system is completely destroyed. Uncontrollable bleeding from the mouth, under the skin and the kidneys occurs. Fatigue and general illness takes its toll. Symptoms are the same as before with increased intensity. Recovery not possible.
More than 20 REM. The same symptoms set in instantly, with increased intensity, then cease for several days in the ""walking ghost"" phase. Suddenly, gastrointestinal cells are destroyed, with a loss of water and excessive bleeding. Death begins with delirium and insanity. When the brain can't control bodily functions like breathing or blood-circulation, one dies. No medical therapy can reverse this; medical help is for comfort only.
Unfortunately, you have to accept that a person may soon die. Though harsh, don't waste rations or supplies on those dying of radiation sickness. Keep rations for the fit and healthy, should supplies be in demand. Radiation sickness is prevalent among the very young, the old or sick.

, A nuclear weapon detonated at a very high altitude will generate an electromagnetic pulse so powerful that it can destroy electronic and electrical devices. At the very least, unplug all devices from electrical sockets and antennas. Placing radios, flashlights in a SEALED metal container (a ""Faraday cage"") may protect from EMP, providing the items being protected are not in contact with the enclosure. The metal shield must surround the protected item completely - and it helps if it is grounded.


The items to be protected should be insulated from the conductive shell, since the EMP field washing over the shield can still induce voltages in solid state circuit boards. A metalized ""space blanket"" (costing about $2.00 USD) wrapped securely around a device wrapped in newspaper or cotton may act as a Faraday shield, helpful if one is far from the blast.
Another method is to wrap a cardboard box in copper or aluminum foil. Place the item in there and plug the device into the ground.

, Most likely, a nuclear attack will not be a singular event. Be prepared for another strike or strikes by enemy nations, or an invasion by the attacking party.


Keep your shelter intact, unless the materials used are absolutely necessary for survival. Collect any excess clean water and food that is available.
However, if the attacking nation does attack again, it will likely be in another part of the country. If all else fails, live in a cave.

Draw up an emergency communication plan.,
Identify emergency meeting points.,
Discuss the plans with your family.,
Consider potential financial implications.",How to Prepare for a Volcanic Eruption1," Volcanic eruptions can be very dangerous, and require thorough preparations to be made by those living or working in the vicinity of an active volcano. The first step of your preparation should be to draw up a comprehensive plan for how you will get in touch with your family if there is an emergency.


Start by writing down all the different ways you can contact each other, and the relevant phone numbers and email addresses. Don't forget landline phone numbers.
The eruption might occur suddenly when your family are not all at home, so it's important to know the emergency plans of the relevant schools, workplaces, and local government.
Identify somebody out of town, such as a family member or family friend, who can act as your central point of contact.
If you get separated and can't get in touch with each other, check in with this person out of town who will be able to relay information between you all.;
, As part of your emergency planning, you should decide on some specific meeting places where your family members can head to if there is an eruption and you have to evacuate. If you have a family member with disabilities, ensure all the places you choose are accessible. Include your pets in your planning and locate places that can accommodate animals. Determine four distinct meeting places.


One of these should be indoor, preferably at home or a nearby storm shelter, somewhere you will be protected from winds and potential volcanic ash.
The second should be a place in your neighborhood that is not your home. If for any reason you cannot get to your house, a nearby location is the next best thing.
The third place should be in your town, but outside of your neighborhood. A central public building such as a library or community center could be a good choice.
Finally, decide on a place outside of your town. This is the place you will go to meet up with your family if you have to leave town suddenly. A family or friend out of town is the best choice for this meeting point., Take the time to talk through the plans with your family so everyone understands, and make sure everyone has a copy of all the relevant contact details in their purse or wallet. Everyone in your family should know what to do if there are warnings to evacuate, and understand that it is not fair to other family members if some of you choose to stay behind in spite of evacuation warnings.You can rehearse the plans and revise them at regular family meetings to ensure that everyone is involved and feels part of the planning.Talking to children about the possibility of a disaster is better than pretending it may never happen.
If children are aware that everything is planned, and know what to do, their fear and anxiety will be reduced in the event of a disaster.

, As well as emergency preparations, you should also take care of the more mundane precautions. That means considering insurance for potential damage caused by volcanoes, and thinking about what impact an eruption could have on your business. If you run a business located in the vicinity of volcanoes, create a business continuity plan to ensure that staff can get to safety, and stock, equipment, and any other business essentials are protected.


If you run a business, you have a responsibility for your staff as well as your family.
A volcano can cause severe property damage. Consider purchasing insurance if you are in a high-risk area."
"
Put together an emergency supply kit.,
Create an emergency kit for your car.,
Consider respiratory protection.,
Prepare communication devices for updates.",How to Prepare for a Volcanic Eruption2," This kit is something that anyone living in a volcano zone should have prepared at all times.The kit should include a first aid kit, food and water supplies, a mask to protect against ash, such as one used when mowing lawns, a manual can opener, a flashlight with extra batteries, any necessary medications, sturdy shoes, goggles or other eye protection, and a battery-powered radio.


Make sure that everyone in your family knows where the kit is kept, and can easily access it in an emergency.
A flashlight, phone charger, and radio combined as one, that runs on both solar power and hand cranking is the ideal item to have ready in your house for any natural disaster event. Pack this if you have one.

, As well as a more general emergency kit, you should be sure to put one together that includes items specifically for your car. This kit should combine general emergency supplies including food, a first aid kit, sleeping bags, blankets and spare batteries, with items to help keep you on the road. Make sure you have a map, as well as booster or jumper cables, a fire extinguisher, and some tools.


Try to make sure you have a full tank of gas. If you don't have access to a car, consider asking a neighbor or friend if you can make an arrangement with them to share a car.
Be sure to speak to the friend or neighbor in advance and don't wait until the evacuation is under way.
If you don't have transportation arranged, speak to local emergency services staff during the evacuation.

, One of the main health dangers of a volcanic eruption is the potential of volcanic ash to damage your respiratory tract. The ash can travel for hundreds of miles on the wind, and is most dangerous for young infants, older adults, or those with pre-existing respiratory illnesses.If you think any member of your family is at a heightened risk, you can consider buying an air purifying respirator.


The N-95 disposable respirator is recommended for use by the government, and can be purchased at local hardware stores.
If you do not have a respirator, you can use a simple dust mask. This might help ease the irritation if you are only exposed to the ash for a short time, but does not offer the level of protection that a respirator does.
If there is volcanic ash in the air outside, stay inside as much as possible to avoid the worst effects.

, Make sure you have all the possible means of receiving updates from the local authorities in good working order, and ready to go. Use your radio or television at home to listen for volcano updates or evacuation notices. Listen out for disaster sirens, and familiarize yourself with what they sound like so you know what to expect. When a volcanic eruption occurs, you'll need to listen for the sirens to go off.

"
"
Evacuate when instructed.,
Attend to livestock and pets.,
Take shelter if you are told to stay where you are.,
Assist others in need.,
Protect yourself if you do go outside.",How to Prepare for a Volcanic Eruption3," It's important to pay close attention to the instructions and alerts given by the local government and emergency services. Remember the emergency services are fully trained to deal with the situation, and will most likely have access to more information than you. If you are told that you need to evacuate, do so swiftly, calmly, and according to the instructions given.


When you evacuate, only take essentials with you, such as your emergency kit and your car emergency kit. Be sure that you have a supply of any prescription medications that will last at least a week.
If you have time, be sure to switch off the gas, electricity and water in your house.
It's also advisable to disconnect your appliances before you go. This reduce the chances of an electric shock when the power is turned back on.
If you are driving, you should follow the designated evacuation routes, and be prepared for heavy traffic. Other routes may be blocked so stick with the given evacuation routes.
If you evacuate, avoid low-lying areas and valleys. There is an increased chance of encountering a mudflow in these areas. If you come to a river, look upstream before crossing. Do not cross if you see a mudflow approaching., In the event that your house and property are directly impacted by the volcano, your animals will not be able to escape. Do what you can within reason to ensure their safety. Be aware that most emergency shelters will be unable to accommodate them. If you're keeping your pets with you, you'll need to be sure that you have planned ahead and have enough food and water for them.


Place your livestock in an enclosed area or make arrangements to transport them as far offsite as possible.

, If you are not told to evacuate, but are advised to stay at home and take shelter, keep listening to the TV or radio so you can move quickly if required. When you are at home you should take extra measures to help ensure your safety and health. Start by closing and securing all of the windows and any doors that lead to the outside. Close your fireplace damper, and then make sure that your heater, air conditioner, and all fans are turned off.


Run extra water in the sinks, bathtubs, and other containers as an emergency supply for cleaning (use as little as possible) or purifying and drinking. You can also get emergency drinking water from a water heater.
Get your family together in a room above ground level that does not have windows in it, if possible.
Keep listening to updates, but stay indoors until you are told it is safe to go out. This is the best way to avoid potential respiratory damage from volcanic ash.

, Whether you are advised to evacuate or take shelter, you should think of others around you, who may need need extra assistance. If you have neighbors who are elderly, have disabilities, or infants, be sure to help out in any way you can. If you are evacuating and have space in your car offer to take an elderly neighbor. If you are sheltering at home invite him to sit in with you, or make sure he is fully prepared in his own home., You should avoid going outside unless given the all clear. If you do need to go out to help somebody, however, try to protect yourself as well as you can. If you have them, wear safety goggles to protect your eyes, and a respirator to protect your lungs. Cover as much of your body as possible, and wrap a scarf around your head.Even swimming goggles and clothing can be used to protect your eyes and breathing if that's all you have.When entering a building after being outside under ash, remove your outer layer of clothing. The ash is difficult to remove from anything it falls on.If you're going outside, remove contact lenses and wear glasses instead. If the ash gets in behind contact lenses, it can cut into your eye, causing corneal abrasions.

Consider if you are providing a service for the sitter.,
Weigh the responsibilities of the house sitting position versus the benefits.,
Decide what you think is fair based on the responsibilities, then negotiate with the house sitter.,
Pay the sitter in advance for any incidental expenses, such as package receipt or newspaper delivery.,

Bring a gift for a house sitter, if they have offered to take care of the house for free.",How to Pay a House Sitter," You can choose an informal route by asking a friend, student or young adult to be a house sitter. Companies like House Sitters America and Trusted House Sitters provide a database by which you can find a house sitter in your area.


On TrustedHouseSitters.com you can search based on sitters that don't require payment and others that do. Although the majority will house sit free of charge in return for a free retreat. This provides a win-win for both parties and as no money is changing hands then it is seem more as someone helping you out, so they are not there to do a job but do of course have a responsibility to care for your home and pets.;
, List all the things that need to be looked after. These can include things like pets, fish, lawn care, cleaning, gardening, houseplants, mail pick up and returning messages. Keep in mind that the more the house sitter needs to do, the more they should be compensated.

, If the house sitter must commute to your house to take care of plants, mail or pets, then pay them for an hour or so per visit. Figure out a fair hourly wage, such as $15 to $25 per visit.

, For some young renters or young people, house sitting may allow them to live rent-free for a short time. In which case, you may not need to pay since it is a fair exchange of services.


Many house sitting agencies arrange services for the mutual benefit of the person watching the house and the house owners. They do not ask for extra compensation beyond the house and utilities. For example, if you plan to leave for a long period of time, then utilities could be paid in exchange for housing and simple house chores.

, The more responsibility, the more they should be compensated. The following things should affect how much you plan to compensate a house sitter:


Taking care of a pet should be seen as 2 jobs. Pets are often much happier staying at home and being cared for by someone they know. Settle on a fair daily wage for watching pets, or a few hundred dollars for watching over weeks or months.
Intensive cleaning of the house or grounds should be considered as a job. While routine cleaning is usual with any house guest, if you have hired a house sitter to live in and maintain a vacation home and they have to deep clean or stock the kitchen regularly for guests, then they should be paid an hourly wage for that time.
Fixing up the house should be considered an hourly job, unless you are giving someone a place to rent for a long period of time.

, They may have expectations of the position. Create a contract, or agreement, if you are hiring a house sitter you have never met before.

, Arrange with the utility companies before you leave, so they don't have to pay large bills.

, Send a check at regular intervals, if someone is providing care for a vacation home.

, Consider something they already like, such as wine, food or a gift from your travels.

While some disasters, such as fire, can happen anywhere, the hazards you might encounter vary widely from place to place. Check with your local emergency management or civil defense office, Red Cross chapter, or the National Weather Service to get an idea of what emergencies you should prepare for.;
, The organizations above will likely be able to advise you what to do in an emergency. They may be able to provide you with evacuation maps and information about local warning systems and emergency plans. If you can't get all the information you need from officials, research your local hazards on your own.


Figure out, for example, what preparations you should make for a tornado or hurricane and how to survive if you're caught in a disaster, and determine the best evacuation routes on your own if need be.
Remember, when push comes to shove, it's your responsibility to ensure your family is well prepared.

, There's a good chance that all your family members won't be in the same place when disaster strikes, so it's important to have a predetermined rendezvous point. Choose a spot that will likely be safe and that is well away from your neighborhood, as you might not be able to make it back to your home.

, Designate a friend or relative as a contact person that you, your spouse, and your children can call if you can't meet up. In order to minimize the chance that the contact person will also be affected by the disaster, choose someone who lives in a distant town or in a different state. Make sure that all your family members have the contact person's phone number with them at all times.

, It's important to educate yourself on how to respond to likely hazards, but what happens to your family if they are away from you or if you're killed or injured? It's not enough for one person in the family to know what to do--everybody should know the plan.

, Once you've identified potential disaster scenarios, thoroughly inspect your house and try to make it as safe as possible. Here are just a few examples:


Every home should have smoke detectors and fire extinguishers. Test smoke detectors at least once a month, and replace their batteries yearly or as needed. Fire extinguishers should be recharged according to the manufacturer's instructions, and family members should learn how to use them. Everyone should also know how to escape the house in the event of a fire.
If you live in an area prone to earthquakes, you wouldn't want a tall, heavy bookcase sitting right next to the baby's crib, as it could be knocked over in a quake.
If you live near woods with the possibility of forest fires, you should clear your property of brush and high grass to create a buffer zone between your home and the fire.

, Everyone who can learn CPR and first aid should take a certification class and keep their certification current. Adults and older children should know how to turn off gas, electricity and water if the house is damaged, and everyone should know how to detect a gas leak. Emergency numbers should be posted near phones, and even small children should be taught how to call 9-1-1 or the corresponding emergency number in your country.


Practicing how to use a fire extinguisher and checking smoke detectors are great reminder exercises to do once a year.

, During an emergency situation, such as an earthquake, your house may lose access to water, and you may not be able to get to the store to get more water. During a flood, you may be surrounded by water, but that water will be unsanitary and unsafe to drink. You also may not have access to drinking water.


Plan on having one gallon (3.785 liters) per person per day. This includes drinking, food preparation, and sanitation water.Store your emergency water in clean, non-corrosive, tightly sealed containers.
Keep the containers in a cool, dark place. Don't store them in sunlight or near gasoline, kerosene, pesticides, and other similar substances., Be prepared for emergencies with at least a three-day supply of non-perishable food and potable water, and other things you might need if you have no utilities and no way to purchase supplies. Keep a smaller kit in the trunk of your car. Your kit should also include the following:Medical consent and history forms for each family member
A small, waterproof flashlight with extra batteries and waterproof matches
A small notepad and waterproof writing instrument
A pay-as-you-go phone or cell phone solar charger
Sunscreen and insect repellant
Whistle and a 12-hour light stick/glow stick
A thermal blanket/space blanket

, Place it in an easy to access place in your home, and make a second one to keep in your car. Medications and ointments do expire, and won't be as effective. Plan on checking your first aid kit once a year, along with the rest of your emergency supplies. If you come across anything that has expired, replace it. Your first aid kit should include an assortment of the following:Absorbent compress dressings and an instant cold compress
Adhesive bandages, triangular bandages, roller bandages, sterile gauze pads, and adhesive cloth tape
Antibiotic ointment packets, hydrocortisone ointment packets, antiseptic wipe packets, and a few packets of aspirin
A pair of non-latex gloves, scissors, tweezers, and a non-glass, non-mercury oral thermometer
Personal and prescription medications

A first aid instruction booklet and a list of emergency phone numbers, including contact information for your doctor, local emergency services, emergency road service providers, and the poison help line.

, Practice makes perfect, and in a life-or-death situation, you want to respond perfectly. Periodically go over your emergency plans with your family, and update them as needed. Quiz and drill your family on important safety concepts. Do a live test with your family; make it an outing and get everyone involved. That will help you identify what works and what doesn't. You should practice carrying out your family's disaster plan at least twice a year.

, In the event your emergency site is unavailable or other things change, it's a good idea to have an alternate plan on hand. What will you do if your contact person is away? What will you do if one of the family members is out of town? Planning for as many scenarios as possible can help increase your chances of safety.

Locate all of the possible escape routes in your home.,
Practice your escape plan at least twice a year.,
Practice taking several safety precautions during your escape.,
Have an escape ladder if you live in a multi-story house, and practice using it.,
Have a fire extinguisher at home, and know how to use it.,
Pick a meeting place that is a safe distance away from your home.,
Make your children comfortable with the escape plan.,
Make sure your home is ready for fire safety.",How to Make a Disaster Plan for Your Family2," Get everyone in your family together and walk around the house to find all of the possible exits. Don't just look for the obvious exits, such as the front and back doors, but other ones as well, such as: first-floor windows, garage doors, and any other safe methods of escape. Try to find at least two ways to get out of each room.Drawing a floor plan of your house and marking the exits can help you remember exactly what to do in the event of a fire.
You should find a way to escape from all of the second floor as well as the first floor rooms.

, Each time that you practice, pretend that the fire is in a different part of the house. This way, you can run the drill several times and know which routes will minimize your exposure to the smoke and fire. You can also practice waking up the sleeping family members of the house, as though the alarm went off at night.


Write out and draw your escape plan so everyone in your family knows exactly what to do.
Practicing the plan in the dark, or even with your eyes closed, can help you get comfortable with your surroundings in case your vision is clouded by smoke when you actually have to escape.

, There are several things you should know how to do as you carry out your escape plan to minimize your likelihood of being exposed to toxic smoke. Smoke and heat rise, so it will always be safer and easier to breathe as close to the ground as possible. Here are some measures that you should take:Practice crawling to avoid getting smoke in your eyes and lungs.
Practice stopping, dropping, and rolling to stomp out any fire on your clothes.
Practice touching a door with the back of your hand to know if there's fire on the other side. Start from the bottom of the door and work your way to the top, as heat rises. If the door is hot during a real fire, stay away.
Practice sealing yourself in your home if you cannot escape. If you have no way to get out, then you should close all doors that are between you and the fire. It will take 20 minutes for the door to burn. Never seal the doors with duct tape or towels.
Practice waving a flashlight or light-colored cloth out the window to let the fire department know where you are.Memorize the phone numbers to the Emergency Services. You will need to call them during a real fire.

, You should be prepared with escape ladders that you can place in or near windows to give yourself another escape route. Learn how to work the ladders for your drill so you'll be prepared to use them in the event of an emergency. You should learn how to use them from the second story windows, if there is no other method of escape from those windows. The ladder should be kept near the windows, in a location that is easy to reach., You should have one on each floor of your house, and inspect it yearly. Bigger is better when it comes to fire extinguishers, but make sure that you can easily carry and maneuver it.There are three types of fire extinguishers intended for home use: Class A, Class B, and Class C. It is also possible to buy a combination fire extinguisher as well, such as Class B-C or Class A-B-C. You can get them at most home improvement stores.A Class A fire extinguisher is intended for ordinary materials like cloth, wood and paper.
A Class B fire extinguisher is meant for combustible and flammable liquids like grease, gasoline, oil and oil-based paints.
A Class C fire extinguisher will put out electrical fires, caused by appliances, tools, and other equipment.

, Once a family member escapes the house, he or she should run to a meeting place that is at a safe distance from your home while not being too far away. This can be your neighbor's front lawn, your mailbox, or a light post. Everyone should meet at this spot once they've escaped so you know that everyone has made it safely once you do a headcount.The meeting place should be marked on your escape plan.

, Your children should not be scared of the fire and should see the drill as a form of practice. Practicing the drill with your children may also help them the dangers of fire, and make them less likely to play with it.


Children should practice the escape routes with an adult so that they don't attempt anything dangerous, like escaping from a second-story window.
Children should always be paired with an adult during the escape plan so they aren't alone.

, Check that you have a smoke alarm in every room, and that all of your doors and windows can be opened easily. This includes popping the screens out. You should also make sure that your street number is visible from the road, a minimum of 3 inches in height, and a contrasting color. This way, the firemen find your home easily, and get to it as quickly as possible.It would be even better if you had a smoke detector outside each bedroom door in the hallway as well as in each stairway.
Remember to replace batteries in the smoke detector every year. It would be a good idea to test the smoke detector during this time as well, to ensure that it is functioning properly.
If your doors or windows have security bars, they should have emergency release levers so they can be opened right away.
Make sure that every family member sleeps with their bedroom door closed. It takes 20 to 30 minutes for a door to burn, which can provide valuable escape time.

Having as many plans as possible can help you find the best methods of escape.Having an out-of-state relative or friend as your contact person in case your family is separated increases your chances of being reunited. Everyone in your household should know the name, address, and phone number of this person.

, If you are under flood watch or warning, then your family should be prepared to gather your emergency supplies and to listen to the local radio or TV station for updates on what to do. You should also gather your outdoor possessions, such as trash cans, grills, and lawn furniture, and tie them down securely. Lastly, you should turn off all of the utilities if it looks like you need to evacuate. Here are some other things you should do, in case you are forced to evacuate or stay:Fill your water containers with enough drinking water to last you 10 to 30 days. Fresh water may become unavailable for long periods of time, and you may not be able to get to the store to buy some.
Sanitize your sinks and tubs and then fill them with clean water so you have them on hand. This way, if you are stranded and the water is shut off, you will have fresh water on hand. Flood water is not sanitary.
Fill your car's tank with gas and put your emergency kit in your car. If you don't have a car, then make arrangements for transportation.
Put your important documents, such as medical records, your insurance cards, and your ID cards, in a waterproof bag.
Find a shelter where you can put your pet, if you have one. Make sure that you have a leash/crate/carrier, extra food, medications (if needed) and shot records.
Keep an ear out for disaster sirens and signals.

, If you are given an evacuation order, then you should listen and get out of your home as soon as you can. Trust that the authorities know what they're doing and that you'll be out of harm's way once you leave. Your family should know what to do if you have to evacuate because of a flood and should be prepared to act. Here are some tips to follow before and when you evacuate:Take only the most important items with you.
Turn off your gas, electricity, and water, if there's time.
Disconnect your appliances.
Follow the evacuation routes given to you by the authorities.
Don't walk across highly flooded areas.
Continue listening to the radio for updates.
Head to a shelter or a friend's home. Make sure that this friend does not live in an area where evacuation is mandatory.

, Prepare to turn off any electrical power in your home before you leave. If there is standing water or fallen power lines nearby, then you should turn off your gas and water to avoid electrical shock when the power comes back on. You should also buy a Class A, B, or C fire extinguisher, and ensure that all of your family members know how to use it. You should also buy and install sump pumps with back-up power in case you need it. Here are some other things you should do to prepare your home:Install backflow valves or plugs in your drains, toilets, and any other sewer connections to keep the flood waters out.
Anchor the fuel tanks in your garage to the ground. If the tanks are torn free, they can be swept downstream and will cause damage to other houses. If they are in your basement, then you don't need to anchor them.
Download your electrical panel by turning off one breaker at a time. Turn the main one off last, to avoid a large electrical arch.

, If you really want to prepare your family for a flood, then you should be prepared with several key items that will increase your chances of safety and survival. Here are some of the items you will need to pack:


Enough containers to hold three to five days worth of water supply
A three to five day supply of non-perishable food and a mechanical can opener
A first aid kit
A battery-powered radio
Flashlights
Sleeping bags and blankets
Baby wipes for cleaning your hands
Chlorine or iodine tablets for purifying water
Soap, toothpaste, and other hygienic supplies
An emergency kit for your car that includes maps, booster cables, and flares
Rubber boots and waterproof gloves

"
Be aware of where carbon monoxide might come from.,
Learn the symptoms.,
Ensure regular maintenance of all household items that have the potential to emit deadly carbon monoxide gas.,
After an emergency, talk to every member of your household or group about the need to be careful when heating and cooking.,
If conditions are too hot or too cold, seek shelter with friends or at a community shelter.

,
If carbon monoxide poisoning is suspected and you are feeling any of the symptoms above, consult a health care professional right away.,
Install a battery-operated CO detector in your home and check or replace the battery when you change the time on your clocks each spring and fall.",How to Prevent Carbon Monoxide Poisoning After an Emergency," Carbon monoxide is often found in combustion fumes, such as those produced by small gasoline engines, stoves and gas cookers, generators, lanterns, and gas ranges, or by burning charcoal and wood. The gas may be caused to leak by rupture from movement of a building or equipment due to a storm, etc., the equipment being used may be defective, or there may be some other cause for the leakage of carbon monoxide, such as inadequate ventilation.


Carbon monoxide from these sources can build up in enclosed or partially enclosed spaces. Typical spaces where problems can occur include house rooms, garages, RVs, boats, tents, campers, garden sheds, marquees, etc. People and animals situated in enclosed spaces with little or no ventilation can die from breathing carbon monoxide.





;
, Part of prevention is noticing when the problem might be occurring. The symptoms are not clear and can easily be confused with other illness but awareness of the possible source contributing to poisoned air (such as a gas stove in the vicinity, or a stuffy room) may help you to pinpoint the symptoms. Moreover, the more persons exhibiting the symptoms, the more you should consider the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning. Common symptoms include:Nausea and vomiting






Confusion, light-headed






Chest pain, fast respiratory rate






Lethargy







Dizziness






A very red face (cherry red)






Eventual unconsciousness in severe cases.







, Ensure that your heating system, water heater, and any other gas, oil, or coal-burning appliances are serviced by a qualified technician every year. Ask them to ensure that all valves, pipes, connections, etc., are in good condition and to replace anything that is faulty or worn.


If your home has chimneys, maintain both chimneys and flues in good condition and check regularly that they're not blocked.







, When an emergency occurs, everyone is likely to be on edge, tired, and perhaps even in shock or full of panic. Not everyone will be thinking straight and they may try to do things to keep warm or to heat up food that are not safe. As such, it is a good idea to gather everyone together to discuss safe methods of using fuels, heaters, cookers, etc., during and after the emergency situation. Some of the things to cover might include:


Avoid using a charcoal grill, hibachi, gas lantern, or portable camping stove inside a home, tent, camper, or any other confined space. Never burn charcoal in your fireplace in the house.






Do not use a gas range or an oven to heat the home. The door of an oven is there for a safety reason.






Keep generators operating outdoors and far from windows and open vents. Never run a generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine inside a basement, garage, or other enclosed structure, even if the doors or windows are open, unless the equipment is professionally installed and vented.






Keep vents and flues free of debris, especially if winds are high. Flying debris can block ventilation lines. You might need to do regular checks during storm weather.






Do not sleep in a room where there is an unvented gas or kerosene heater.






Never run a motor vehicle, generator, pressure washer, or any gasoline-powered engine outside an open window, door, or vent where exhaust can vent into an enclosed area.






Never leave the motor running in a vehicle parked in an enclosed or partially enclosed space, such as a garage.







,, When helping a suspected sufferer of carbon monoxide poisoning, watch yourself; you don't want to succumb to the gas as well.


Open windows to restore as much fresh air as possible. If this isn't possible, get the person to a place where the air is totally fresh.






Clear the victim's airway to assist breathing. If you know what you're doing, you can administer oxygen but if not, seek immediate medical advice.







, If the detector sounds leave your home immediately and call 911 or the equivalent emergency services in your country. Do not use the CO detector in place of any of the other steps – it is simply an additional layer of possible protection.

Have weapons at your disposal.,
These items will help you dearly: 1.),
Use your body.,
If someone does break into your house or if there's someone suspicious nearby, don't panic, even though it's easier said than done.,
If anything happens or if you see somebody lingering around your house, grab a phone immediately!,
Be smart.,
Home invasions are tricky comparing if you have more of a bigger house, considering there will be more ways to get in, compared to a small house, with limited ways to get in.

,
Do whatever you need to survive if someone tries to attack you while you are home alone (besides the invader).

",How to Prepare to Defend Yourself when You're Home Alone," You should never have any thing like an AK-47 or a machete, but just have certain items that you can defend yourself with.;
, A baseball bat (to hit or block with.) 2.) Some sort of heavy object, or ball. 3.) Some sort of spray, such as pepper spray (to drive away, or temporary blind them.)


Anything hard can help you significantly, unless you aren't that strong. You can use lighter objects are still effective, and can help defend yourself.

, If you don't have any of the items listed before, your body can still be an effective weapon, if you know how to use it right.

, This is something that you may not know: panic isn't the worst thing to have in a difficult situation. Ever heard of ""adrenaline""? Most people have, but for those of you that don't know what it is, basically it is a rush of energy that runs through your body and you sort of gives you an extra sense of awareness.

, If you think it's something unusual, call the Emergency Services! Even if it isn't anything to concerned about at the moment, still call! The Emergency Services are specialized in emergency situations. The person from the Emergency Services should give you valuable tips or instructions on what to do, depending on your situation.

, If someone gets into your house, don't confront them at the time of their arrival. Assess your situation. You most likely won't know who it is that's in your house, but try to figure them out. Are they men or women? Next, try to figure out if they are concealing any lethal weapons. These assessments will help you have an idea of whether they're male or female, and what weapon(s) they might have. This will help you SIGNIFICANTLY because you now have an idea of what to do. If they are a male, one weak spot that everyone knows about is the groin. For women, well, that's a different story. Women have more strong spots than weak. If he/she has for example a gun, you know not to let them know where you are. If you do, they will immediately go to where you are, and attack you.

Gather your materials.,
Attach the plywood to the wall next to your door.,
Cut three strands of insulated wire.,
Strip the ends of each strand.,
Tape the battery and buzzer onto your wooden board.,
Wrap the stripped wire around the ends of the clothespin.,
Connect the bottom-pin wire to the battery.,
Connect one non-battery wire to the buzzer.,
Break the circuit with a piece of cardboard.,
Connect the remaining wires.,
Test the switch by completing the circuit.,
Check connections and the battery if the buzzer doesn't activate.,
Glue the clothespin to the board.,
Manage excess wires with tape and hang the board.,
Attach the string to the piece of cardboard in the clothespin.,
Fasten the other end of the string to your door.",How to Make a Door Alarm," The supplies you need should all be available at your local hardware store or home center. If a 1.5 volt buzzer isn't available at your local hardware or home center, try looking at an electronics store. All things considered, these supplies should cost around $30 if you have to buy all of the following:


1.5 volt battery
1.5 volt mini buzzer
Cardboard (like from a cereal box)
Electrical tape
Glue
Insulated wire (3 strands, small gauge)
Piece of plywood (4x12 in (10.2x30.5 cm) or larger)
Tape measure (or measuring stick)
Wall hangers (glue-based, removable)
Wooden clothespin (with spring)
3 - 5 ft (.91 - 1.5 m) of string
Wire snips (or sturdy scissors)
Wire strippers;
, Use removable wall hangers or tape to attach the wood on the wall. This will be the base of your door alarm. You may need to drill holes in the wood to hang it from the hangers.


Generally, you'll want to attach your piece of wood close to the top of the door, within a foot (30.5 cm) from the door frame.
Alternatively, you can place the alarm flat on a desk, nightstand, or bookshelf positioned close to the door so you don't have to hang it.
An alarm that's high up will be harder to reach and deactivate. Doing this, however, might require more string., Use a pair of sturdy scissors or wire snips to cut three stands of wire each one foot (30.5 cm) long. If using scissors, you may have to work these back and forth before the wire weakens and cuts.


Measure the wires with a tape measure or measuring stick and bend the wires where you will cut them. This will make it easier to cut accurately.
If you find that your scissors don't cut the wire well, a sharp knife, like a utility knife, can work as a substitute., Each wire should be covered in an insulated coating. This can be stripped off with your wire strippers. Place two inches (5 cm) of wire into the slot on the strippers that is marked for the gauge of wire you are using. Close the strippers firmly and pull the wire through to remove the insulation. Do this for both ends of each strand.


Scissors or a utility knife can also be used to remove insulation. Cut the insulation until you hit the metal wire on the inside, then peel off the insulation.
If the insulation doesn't come free easily, use a pair of pliers to grip the insulation firmly and pull it off., Use electrical tape to attach these to the wood. The tape should not interfere with or cover any of the connections for the electrical circuit for the buzzer, nor should it cover the positive (+) or negative (-) ends of the battery.Your buzzer may come with screw holes. For a sturdier alarm, you can screw your buzzer into the wood. Be careful to use short nails so these don't protrude through the board.

, Wrap one stripped end of two pieces of wire around frontmost divot of the top of the clip-end of the clothespin. Do the same to the bottom of the clip-end of the pin with a separate wire. Twist the stripped wires around the pin until they are tight.When the pin closes, the wires should touch. This will complete the circuit that sets off your alarm., Position the wire so it is directly touching the positive (+) end of the battery. Use a piece of electrical tape to fasten the wire in place. If your battery is in a dock or cradle, attach the wire to the positive connector or wire for the cradle and tape it in place., There should be a small opening in the buzzer where you can insert your wire. There should be two connectors, positive and negative. Touch one of your top clothespin wires directly to the positive input for the buzzer.Alternatively, your buzzer may have wire leads coming off of it. Strip these, if necessary, and twist your non-battery wire to the positive buzzer wire.

, Cut a medium sized piece of cardboard to insert between the wires wrapped around the clothespin. Insert the cardboard so that the wires on the clothespin do not touch when it is closed. This will stop the buzzer from going off.Any non-conductive material will work to break your circuit. Try small pieces of paper, wood, or rubber.
You may need to fold thin cardboard so there is more distance between wires. Very thin cardboard may not reliably keep the circuit broken., Attach the stripped end of one of your remaining free clothespin wires to the negative (-) end of the battery. Fasten it with electrical tape. Then, in the same fashion as the first, attached the final clothespin wire to the negative (-) input for the buzzer.


After you finish attaching the wire to the buzzer, cover any remaining bare wires with tape. While the circuit is engaged, touching bare wire will result in a shock.
Be careful not to knock out the circuit breaker between the wires of your clothespin. Doing so will complete the circuit, and likely cause a small shock when you try to attach the wire to the buzzer., Lay your alarm on a flat surface. Open the clothespin and remove the circuit breaker (piece of cardboard). When the clothespin closes, the circuit should complete and the buzzer turn on.


The ends of stripped wire on the clothespin should be in good contact. If they aren't or are just barely touching, wrap more wire around the clothespin.
When adjusting the clothespin wires, disengage your battery from the circuit to prevent getting shocked., If the buzzer doesn't activate, one of the connections is likely loose. Reinsert the breaker (cardboard) and refasten all connections. After that, if the alarm still doesn't work, replace your current battery with a new one.


To improve connections between wires, wrap wires together. After that, tape bare wires to prevent accidental shocks.
To improve the connection between connectors, use pliers to coil the end of the wire in a small circle. The circle should be small enough to fit against the connector. Tape the wire circle to the connector.
In some cases, you may have a faulty buzzer. Test your buzzer by hooking it up to a traditional power source as directed in the buzzer directions. If it doesn't work, your buzzer is faulty.

, Remove your board from the wall. Your battery and buzzer should already be taped to it. Glue the clothespin so it is positioned somewhat close to the battery and buzzer. Follow the glue directions and allow the glue to dry completely before moving on.


A clothespin is small enough that general purpose glue or hot glue should work to fasten it. For best results, you may want to use a sturdy glue or a wood glue.

, Wires sticking out in all directions can be a hazard. They can snag on objects or be easily pulled out. Damaged wires will deactivate your alarm. Tape your wires to the board to prevent them from snagging or being pulled out. Then re-hang the board on the wall.

, Tape a piece of string to the cardboard. Alternatively, use scissors to make a small hole in the cardboard and tie the string to the hole in the cardboard in a simple knot.Make sure the string is firmly attached to the cardboard. The door may be opened suddenly. If weakly fastened, the string may pull free while the cardboard remains. In this case, the alarm will not go off., Attach the string to the doorknob or tape it to a part of the door. Adjust the length of the string so that when the door opens, the string is pulled. When the cardboard pulls out, the alarm will go off.If your door is painted or made of a nice material, you may not want to tape the string to it. Some tape, when peeled away, can damage paint or wood.

Find the keyhole.,
Make sure that your key fits.,
Lock the door from the outside.,
Lock the door from the inside.,
Make sure that the door is locked.",How to Lock a Door1," If your doorknob is accompanied by a lock, you should see a jagged slit on the outward-facing knob of the door. There should be a locking button on the inside part of the knob. The jagged slit is the keyhole. If you have a key for this door, it should fit perfectly into the keyhole and will allow anyone with that specific key to enter the premises.The inside lock button will usually appear in two forms: a twist-lock or a push-lock. Both buttons are typically made from the same metallic material as the doorknob. The twist-lock button is often circular, with a pointed ridge down the center. The pointed ridge is for your finger to twist the lock. Normally, if you twist it right it will lock the door, and if you twist it right, it will unlock it. The push-lock button is a small cylinder. It isn't the most common type of lock these days, but you will see many of them in public restrooms.
If the doorknob does not have a keyhole or a lock button, then it does not lock. Try replacing the doorknob with a lockable handle.;
, Slide the key into the keyhole of the outer doorknob. If the key will not fit, flip it upside down and try again. The key may have one jagged edge and one smooth edge, or it may have multiple jagged edges. These jagged ridges along the length of the key are what match it to this particular lock. The more jagged the key, the tighter the security., Close the door while you are standing outside. Slide the key into the keyhole and turn it clockwise as far as it will go. If you turn the key far enough, the door should lock. If this does not work, flip the key upside down and try again.

To remove the key, turn it counter-clockwise back to the position at which you slid it in – but no further. Pull the key out of the keyhole.
To unlock the door from the outside, simply slide the key into the keyhole and turn it counter-clockwise as far as it will go. Once again, if it does not work just flip the key upside down and try again. You should feel the doorknob release. It should turn, now. Remove the key from the lock.

, You don't need a key to lock most doors from the inside. Find the push-lock or twist-lock button on the inner doorknob.

If your knob has a push-lock: You should see a small, cylindrical button protruding from the center of the knob. Push the button. This should lock the door. Turn the knob to make sure that the door is locked. To unlock the door, simply turn the knob from the inside; it will not unlock if you turn it from the outside.
If your knob has a twist-lock: You should see a circular button with a ridge down the center. Pinch the ridge and twist the button clockwise as far as it will go--likely a 90-degree quarter-turn. This should lock the door, but turn the knob to make sure. To unlock the door, simply twist the button counter-clockwise as far as it will go.

, Try to turn the doorknob and push the door open. If the knob turns and the door opens, then you didn't lock the door. If the knob rattles, but does not turn, then you have locked the door."

Check your door for a deadbolt.,
Lock a deadbolt from the outside.,
Lock a deadbolt from the inside.,
Consider installing a deadbolt.",How to Lock a Door2," The deadbolt should be a circular piece of metal, anywhere from a few inches to a few feet directly above the doorknob. The deadbolt functions just like the doorknob, but it uses a different key and its bolt is much heavier. On the outside of the door, the deadbolt should look like another keyhole. On the inside of the door, the deadbolt should feature a heavy, rotatable switch. A locked deadbolt will keep the door from opening even if the doorknob turns.

If your door doesn't have a deadbolt, do not worry. A deadbolt is not an essential security feature, although it will make your door even harder to break through.

, If you have a key for the deadbolt, use it. This key should be different from the key that fits the doorknob. Close the door and stand outside. Slide the key into the deadbolt keyhole and turn it clockwise as far as it will go. If you turn the key far enough, the door should lock.

To remove the key, turn it counter-clockwise back to the position at which you slid it in – but no further! Pull the key out of the keyhole.

Wedge the chair as close to the door as you can.",How to Lock a Door3," You may have seen this in the movies – and it really works! Bear in mind that this method only works if the door opens inward.Warning: If someone tries to force the door open from the outside, there is chance that the chair will break. This is a trick, not a fail-proof security system.

, Do not use a folding chair. Close the door and stand inside, so that the door opens toward you. Wedge the top of the back of the chair underneath the doorknob, between the knob and the door. The two front legs of the chair should not be touching the ground., The chair should apply pressure to the door, at an angle, focused just beneath the doorknob.

.This is a sketchy plan of a cottage.The lean on is a tiny one.It's a shower, actually.Marked in a circle you can see the lean on door, hinges in the left.The door opens outwards.,

Know what you will need.,
THE BAR with the bolt hole attached to the door ( locking ring ).,
BOLT: get a length of thick iron rod, mark 10 centimeter (3.9 in) from one end,give it with the metal saw 4 cuts about 1 or 1'5 mm deep,separated 2 or 2'5mm from the next.Hold the rod horizontally clamped sure in the vice.Hammer on the short part remembering that the cuttings go in the inside of the R angle.Make sure the rest reaches about 1/3 of the width of the door,including thickness for the wall of the main building, and width of the optional wall if there´s one.Finally give the other end of the bolt a nice tip with the grinder to make it engage better.
,
SHEATH: Get inside the lean on with a long ruler,a level and a pencil.From the middle of the door draw a horizontally levelled line until you reach the main wall of the cottage,garage, whatever.Drill a big hole and enlarge it to fit the sheath.In the inside end ( cottage) add some plates with holes.Fix the sheath in the hole,keep it aligned and the cement o glue is set,fix the plates with holes,two plates will be enough.If there´s an optional wall the sheath fixing is longer but simpler.,
RIGHT-ANGLED BAR about 4 centimeter (1.6 in) wide, 1 centimeter (0.4 in) thick and about 50 centimeter (19.7 in) long.Proceed as with the bolt.Take 10 centimeter (3.9 in) from one end and holding it in the vice do the same cutting/marking.,
Make the tip of the bolt show.Rub it with chalk or with some white sticky paint.,
Make a reference mark on the optional wall of the lean on when the bolt is fully pushed in.,

The idea of a SB is applied to furniture, here.
,
The moment the lid of the desk is closed and locked, and the key taken, we'll have two elements locked with a single key in a very simple way.


",How to Make a Security Bolt for a Lean On," That strange R angle on the rim of the door is the locking ring where the bolt engages. Then there´s an ""OPTIONAL WALL"" on which the sheath for the bolt is fixed by masonry.The sheath goes thru the wall of the cottage.In the interior you you can see the handle of the bolt sticking out of the wall, The bolt consists of three elements, like any ordinary bolt:


A strong rod of iron with a right angle (handle part),and a pointed tip on the other end: that´s the BOLT itself.
A SHEATH made of square tubing thru which the rod will slide.Must be square to easily add any welded fixings,masonry or carpentry and also to lay even on flat surfaces.

The fixing of the sheath depends on the materials the main building and the lean on are made of: fixings for masonry or fixing with screws, bolts and nuts in case you´re using wood planks or metal sheets.If your lean on is L shaped plus door then the sheath will be as long as width of the main building wall.Extra fixing may have to be welded to the sheath (masonry fixing plus screws



,







THE R ANGLED BAR with a big hole for the bolt (shorter side of the R angle) and a number of minor holes for fixing the bar to the lean on door (longer side of the R angle). The door should have some reinforcement for a sound fixing of this element.

No measurements have been given because they depend on your very own project.



,,, With the help of the hammer get a neat R angle.Drill some holes on the longer part to fix it against the door.The R angle part must be several cm from the edge of the door to allow its swinging.Keep it aligned when screwing it on on a reinforced part do the door., Retract bolt. Close the door with great care and bang the bolt against the right-angled bar.You will get a white mark that will tell you where the hole for the bolt should go.Use a round file if needed, until the bolt fits in snugly., It will save you plenty of walking if the bolt and hole are not aligned when you close the lean on door for the day.,,"

Budget for your safe.,
Figure out the correct size.,
Choose a wall safe with fire resistance.,
Decide which access control features you would like.,
Check theft resistance ratings.,
Decide if you want water resistance.,
Buy your safe from a store that specializes in safes.,
Find the right location.,
Locate your studs.,
Mark your studs.,
Cut out a small square of space using a drywall saw.,
Reach into the space with your hand to feel for electrical wiring or plumbing.,
Measure the wall to mark the size hole needing to be cut for the safe.,
Cut along the marks to create a hole in the wall.,
Slide your safe into the hole.,
Fix the safe to the studs by drilling through the holes in the sides of the safe.,
Insert the shelves.",How to Install a Wall Safe," Wall safes cost between $50-$350 on average but some will be even higher priced. For a decent safe you can budget between $150-300 but the actual price will depend on the features and size you want.


Different security features and fireproofing abilities can increase the cost of your chosen safe.;
, Most homes are built from two-by-fours (44 x 94mm) spaced 16 inches (40.5 cm) apart. This means that the typical safe will have to fit in this space. Look for a wall safe with a width of less than 16 inches (40.5 cm) and depth of 3.5 inches (9 cm). You can then chose the height that you prefer in which to fit your belongings.


Check the size of your walls if you feel they do not agree with these average measurements by finding the studs in your walls., Fire resistant safes will protect your valuables and papers in the event of a fire. Both Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and Intertek (ETL) are independent organizations that rate wall safes according to fire resistance. If you want a fire resistant wall safe choose one that will protect your goods for at least 30 minutes because most fires move through a room in about 20 minutes.


UL and Intertek rate wall safes according to the type of material they will protect and the length of time they will provide protection. Look on the safe itself or the packaging for these ratings.
Choose the wall safe with a fire protection rating according to what you would like to protect. Papers should not get hotter than 350 degrees F (176 degrees C), old tape recordings or 35mm slides no hotter than 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) and CDs/DVDs no hotter than 125 degrees F (52 degrees C).In Europe the Eurograde system evaluates wall safes.

, Access control features may include a combination, a key, both a key and pin code or biometric data such as a fingerprint. All access methods are fairly effective and depend on the user to maintain their effectiveness.


If you are using a wall safe as a gun safe then it might be preferable to choose biometric access to prevent a key or code from falling into the hands of children.

, Some but not all wall safes have been tested for burglary resistance. Again check for the UL label. A safe rated B4 then it would be able to withstand an attack of at least 15 minutes using common tools.


Most burglaries take around 8-12 minutes so a wall safe with this rating would be safe during this time.
Ratings of B1, B2 or B3 mean the safe provides very little security and resistance to tools.
A B5 rating means the safe can withstand 30 minutes of a typical attack with common tools while a B6 rating means the safe can withstand 30 minutes of attack with common tools, torches and carbide-tipped tools., Water resistance ratings are also performed by Intertek and will be marked “verified” if they meet criteria. These safes would protect valuables in case of a flood or broken water line.

, Safes can be purchased from many hardware stores as well as online marketplaces. Buying a wall safe from a shop that specializes in safes can give you the opportunity to speak to an expert regarding the options that would work best for you.

, Choose a location that is accessible so that you can use the safe effectively. Additionally the safe should be out of the regular traffic pattern of the house such as a closet, the laundry room, behind a heavy piece of furniture, behind a bookcase filled with books or in a child’s room. This makes the wall safe less noticeable and obvious to potential intruders.


The location will also depend on the studs in your wall. Make sure you choose a location which will be able to make use of the space between studs.

, You will want to fix your safe between studs to allow it to be recessed inside your wall and thus less noticeable. Use a stud finder to locate the studs behind the wall by running the stud finder across your wall. The tool will have an indicator to show when it has found a stud.


Stud finders can be purchased from your local hardware store.
If you don’t have a stud finder you can knock on the wall and listen for a hollow or solid sound. If the sound is hollow then the location is probably between studs; if it sounds solid then there is likely a stud in this location.
Knock a nail into the wall. As you hammer you will be able to feel if you hit a stud by the way the nail goes into the wall. These holes will be covered once you have installed your wall safe.

, Use a pencil to mark the locations of the studs on the wall. This will help orient your lines when you cut out the section of the wall.

, After you’ve found a good safe and a place to install it between studs, you are ready to cut into your wall. Cut out a small square of space big enough for your hand to fit through.

, If you find wires you need to be extra careful to go around them or reroute them. If you find plumbing in the way you may need to find a new location. If the wall is clear, you are ready to cut out a space for your safe.


If something is in the way and you are not confident in your ability to safely move or go around it, the best option is to find a new section of wall.

, Mark the four corners of your square hole using a pencil. Use a level to make level lines between the four corners. It is essential that the top and bottom are parallel with the ground while the sides are parallel with your studs.


The hole should be close enough to a stud so that you can attach it to your safe later.
Make sure to measure and level correctly so that you don’t end up with an uneven or wrongly sized hole.

, Use your drywall saw to cut along the marked lines. Start with the bottom edge of the opening and then cut the sides. You should cut the top line last to make sure the piece does not fall out beforehand, creating an uneven line.

, Put your safe into the hole, remembering to keep it help up with your hand. The door is the heaviest part of the safe due to the locking mechanism so be careful to hold up the corner so that it doesn’t fall out on you.

, Drill holes into the sides that match with the holes on the interior of your safe. Drill in each screw and then tighten them firmly.


This is an important step that prevents burglars from simply cutting your safe out of the wall and walking away with the whole thing.

, Place the shelves inside the safe in their desired locations, making sure you line them up correctly. Some shelves will have cutouts to make space for the door locking mechanism and door hinges; make sure these cutouts are in the correct locations.

, Even if you may have grown up in a place where it was okay to leave your door unlocked, the world is different now. Many robbers only enter homes when they find a door is unlocked.

, Ground level windows and sliding doors are easy to open from the outside. A slightly more motivated thief will check.

, Never leave the balcony door unlocked at night or when going out. Balconies could provide easy access to burglars.

, Garage doors provide access into your home, so treat them as any other door; make sure they are locked properly, as well as the door that leads from the garage room into your house.

, When moving into a new residence, change all locks as you never know who has a copy of your key.

, When you go out, leave a light on in any room in the house or invest in a light timer to automatically turn on lights at whatever time you want. Let the thief hesitate about breaking in.

, For example: ""Hi delivery company, I won't be home all day just leave my packages on the back porch."" To a robber, that says, ""Hi robber, I'm not home for the day so you can rob my house."" Not only will a thief look on your porch, he'll also know definitively that you won't be home for the day.

, Keep drapes closed in rooms with expensive equipment that could give burglars a peek into your home.

, If you see a strange car driving through the neighborhood several times a day, report it! If someone is sitting in their car parked on your street for a long time, report it! A moving van at your neighbors house with no for sale sign, report it!

, It is harder for a thief to break in if there are lights placed at entry points to your house.

, If a burglar managed to break into your house, an alarm system could deter him from proceeding.

, Someone else might have picked it up.

Understand the importance of child protection.,
Always be aware of what can happen to your child or any child.,
Be sure that your children are aware of the dangers, but try to balance their knowledge so that they are not overwhelmed and lose their childhood.

",How to Educate Others on the Importance of Child Protection," In order to spread the message, it is important to know the facts. The basics are:


Every child should have the opportunity to grow up in a family. If a family is unable to care for the child, steps should be taken by the authorities to address the reasons and make every effort to keep the family together.
Every child has a right to a name and nationality. Registering a child's birth helps to ensure a child's right to education, health care and legal and social services. Birth registration is a vital step towards protection from abuse and exploitation.
Girls and boys must be protected from all forms of violence and abuse. This includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse, neglect and harmful practices such as child marriage and genital mutilation/cutting of girls. Families, communities and authorities are responsible for ensuring this protection.
Children must be protected from all work that is hazardous. Work should not prevent them from attending school. Children should never be involved in the worst forms of child labour, such as slavery, forced labour, drug production or trafficking.
Girls and boys can be at risk of sexual abuse and exploitation in their home, school, workplace or community. Measures should be taken to prevent sexual abuse and exploitation. Sexually abused and exploited children need immediate help to stop such abuse.
Children are vulnerable to trafficking where protection for children is weak or missing. The government, civil society and families are responsible for preventing trafficking, as well as helping children who are victims to reintegrate into their families and communities, if it is in their best interest.
Justice for children should be based on child rights. Depriving children of their liberty (incarcerating them) must always be a last resort. Procedures that are sensitive to children should be put in place for children who are victims or witnesses of crime.
Income support and social welfare services can help keep families together and children in school and ensure access to health care.
All children have a right to age-appropriate information, to be heard and to participate in making decisions that concern them. Fulfillment of this right enables children to take an active role in their own protection against abuse, violence and exploitation, and to become active citizens.;
, They can be injured, kidnapped, abused, and many other things.

These can sometimes be opposite what you might expect, but when breaking in to your home, the burglar will try to appear natural, as though he belongs there or has permission to enter your home. This makes the following entrances especially vulnerable to break-ins:


Front door
First-floor windows
Side/rear doors, Obvious reinforcements will make your home a less desirable target. Burglars will be able to tell at a glance whether or not a door into your home is hollow core, which can be kicked down easily, or insulated metal, which can withstand greater punishment.Use dowels or rods as security bars. Lay these along the inside track of sliding doors and horizontally sliding windows to prevent being forced open.

Install reinforced locks on exterior doors.

Install a security door, or some other sturdy variety, like a solid core door.

, The accumulation of mail on your front stoop or mailbox could indicate to a burglar that you're on vacation and that your home is ripe for robbing. Packages, too, even those that are not valuable, can send potential burglars a signal that your home is infrequently occupied if left unattended., This is a good tactic even if you don't have a security system or a dog. Burglars will frequently avoid the risk of a guard dog or professional security system. ""Beware of Dog"" signs can be placed at the entrance of your home or in your front yard, while imitation security system stickers should be stuck to the main entrance and exit of your home.""Beware of Dog"" signs can be bought at most hardware stores but can also be purchased online.
Imitation security system stickers might be found at a hardware store, home security store, spy/surveillance shop, or online.

, Lawn that is patchy or excessively long can indicate to potential burglars that you are away and your home vulnerable. Poorly kept shrubs, bushes, and trees, on the other hand, can provide burglars with places to hide while breaking into your home. Keep your yard well maintained to prevent burglars break in opportunities., Burglars tend to avoid both the ruckus caused by a barking dog and the potential of getting bit. Even small dogs can make a home less desirable to a burglar. Some popular dog breeds for you to consider include:Bull mastiff
Doberman
German shepherd
Rottweiler, New TVs, expensive (and highly portable) laptop computers, jewelry, and other valuables can be extra tempting to prowling burglars. Don't leave these sitting out in the open. To prevent undue attention to your things, you might:Put up curtains or blinds to make it more difficult for burglars to peep inside your home.
Store expensive outdoor items, like bicycles and barbecues, in a storage unit.
Tint your windows.

, Many thorn bushes, like roses, have beautiful flowers that can add to the beauty of your house even while protecting it. Thorny bushes, shrubs, and trees that are planted outside windows will make it more difficult for burglars to enter using these access points. A short list of effective home defense shrubs includes:Barberry
Pyracantha
Roses, These can be bought at most hardware stores and are excellent, cost efficient ways of making your home look occupied and undesirable to burglars. If you spend most of your day at work, you might set a timer to turn on lights or a TV during lunchtime.Motion sensor lights at the main doors of your house are another affordable prevention measure you might employ.
Be sure to set your timer before going on extended trips or vacation., Professional security systems offer many advantages to home protection, often providing services like monitoring and improved police response. But even if a professional grade system is out of your price range, you can still purchase fake security cameras from your local hardware or home security store to achieve a similar effect.When setting up imitation cameras, be sure you do so convincingly. Connect the camera to an outlet even if it doesn't need power, and arrange other wires to appear connected to the inside of your home.

, Ground floor windows are the most likely to be used by burglars, so unless you live in an especially bad neighborhood, it's unlikely that you'll need to install bars higher than the first story. Security bars that you can attach to the outside of your windows can be bought at most hardware stores, and are a sturdy, high visibility deterrent.


Second story windows and doors are responsible for approximately 2% of burglaries, and usually only need to be secured with regular measures., It's not likely that you have to be cautious about your Facebook friends breaking into your home, but information about your trip can travel quickly among acquaintances and the friends of friends. These individuals, who you may not know well or trust, could see your online post about your vacation and think it a prime opportunity to make some easy money by stealing from your home while you are away., Or you could always arrange for a trusted neighbor to collect your mail while you are away. In either case, taking steps to ensure newspapers, mail, or magazine subscriptions don't pile up on your doorstep will make it less obvious to burglars that you're not home., Professional burglars often observe a neighborhood or a handful of likely targets to determine the rhythm of its occupants. This informs the burglar of the best time to break in. Many of your daily habits can be inferred from the trash you produce, so you should limit the information you provide burglars by limiting access to your trash.If a garage is not available, you might build a small structure to store your garbage cans with 2x4 pieces of wood, thick gauge chicken wire, hinges, and a latch. You can then lock your garbage cans in your enclosure to prevent snooping.

, Regular patrols will be more likely to notice strange cars or people that don't belong in your neighborhood. This can also cut down on the opportunities burglars have to evaluate your house for future theft.Inquire with your neighborhood association or homeowner's association to see if your community has a neighborhood watch program already in place.

Check out some tips on how to form your own neighborhood watch.

, Take a stroll around your property every other week or so and check that all your security measures are in place and untampered with. Take note of strange scratches around locks and latches, strange footsteps in flowerbeds, and anything else that might suggest you have an unwanted visitor poking around your property.

Install security software.,
Create strong passwords.,
Don't respond to phishing or spamming emails.,
Contact the appropriate authorities.,
Review your bank statements.",How to Fight Crime3," There are a number of good products out there that will keep your computer secure.

Be smart.",How to React to a Fire in Your Home from Cooking," Quickly decide if you can safely extinguish the fire. If not, direct someone to call emergency services and quickly, but calmly, leave the house. If the fire is small enough and it appears that you can extinguish it, proceed with utmost caution.;
, Your smoke alarm should have already done so, but if for some reason it didn't, make sure that everyone in the house knows about the fire and can quickly get to safety.

, If you can safely and quickly do so, try smothering out the fire. You can use one or more of the following methods to smother a grease/oil fire:


Use an appropriate fire extinguisher if available.
Cover the fire with a tight fitting lid if possible. Alternatively you could slide a cookie sheet over a pan that is on fire.
Use baking soda or any dry powder such as flour, pancake mix, etc. to smother the fire.

, Ask any of the firefighters that are stopping the fire to remind you when the fire is over. Listen and wait for their responses when it's safe to go back in. If the fire was a light one be sure you got the fire and it has no chance of coming again.

, The most important thing you can do in the case of a cooking fire is to remain calm and stay in control. Taking charge of the situation can help reduce anxiety and help keep you calm. Take a few deep breaths and find ways to access the situation safely.

, A fire is not something funny and can be deadly so do not take your situation as a game or joke. Take action seriously and do not play around with the fire.

Use appliances according to the instructions.",How to Put out a Toaster Fire," In any emergency situation, one of the most important things to remember is to stay calm. Panicking can lead to bad decisions, and in the case of a kitchen fire, bad decisions can cause the fire to spread.


The best way to stay calm during an emergency is to be prepared. Know the steps you should take in case of a kitchen fire, and know where your tools are, including your fire extinguisher, blankets, first aid kits, and the nearest exit.;
, When you notice a toaster fire, the first step to resolving the situation is cutting the power, which will remove the heat source that’s causing the fire. If you can't safely get to the plug to remove it from the wall, use the fuse box to cut the power going to the outlet., Once a fire has been ignited, it needs a fuel source to continue burning, and one of those fuel sources is oxygen. To put out the fire, therefore, you have to smother the oxygen supply. You can smother a toaster fire by:


Covering it with a fire blanket or a large, wet towel.Using a fire extinguisher. Be sure to aim the nozzle at the base of the fire.Dousing it with baking soda or salt.Do not use flour, which can actually explode if it’s heated too quickly.

, When a fire is too large or too out of control for you to maintain, you must immediately get yourself and your family out of the house. Once you're all in a safe place, call the fire department from a cell phone or neighbor’s house. Don’t try to fight the fire on your own if:


You have any doubts about your ability to contain it.
The fire is spreading and you cannot contain it.The fire is larger than a basketball., After the fire has been put out and the toaster has cooled, remove all the burnt material. If there are signs of melting, damage, or problems with the wiring or electrical components, replace the toaster.

, Whether you prefer a fire extinguisher or a fire blanket is up to you, but you should always keep one in the kitchen, mounted in plain sight. Having it visible at all times will give you faster access to it in case of an emergency, and will prevent panic that comes with not being able to find something you need in an emergency. If you go with an extinguisher, be sure to choose the right type, as there are different kinds:Water and foam extinguishers are only good for basic combustibles (class A), which include things like wood and paper.
Carbon dioxide extinguishers are best for flammable liquids like gas and oil (class B), and electrical fires (class C).
Dry chemical extinguishers are equipped to extinguish class A, B, and C fires.
Wet chemical extinguishers are for cooking fats and oils, and are particularly useful for people or restaurants that deep fry lots of food.

, Fanning flames with a towel or blowing on a fire could provide the fire with more oxygen (and, therefore, more fuel), and could spread the fire to a new area.Instead of fanning, always try to smother a fire.


Stovetop fires can often be put out simply by placing a lid over the pot to smother the fire.

, While oven and microwave fires are still dangerous, they can be controlled with the least amount of effort. Simply shut off the appliance and keep the door closed. Eventually the fire will run out of oxygen and go out.Always stay in the room and monitor fires like this when you're waiting for them to go out., Grease is hydrophobic, meaning it’s repelled by water, so if you pour water on a grease fire, the grease will splatter and the fire will spread.And flour, unlike baking soda, can actually explode when it’s in dust form.To smother a grease fire (or any other kitchen fire), put a lid on it, cover it with a fire blanket, or use baking soda, salt, or a fire extinguisher.

, Many kitchen fires occur because of lack of supervision. Always be present when you're cooking with oil and grease or using appliances like the toaster. If your broiling or baking, check on the oven frequently.If you have to leave the room while you're cooking with oil or grease, take the pans off the heat and turn off the element., Lots of kitchen fires are also started because fabrics get too hot and go up in flames, and this could be a towel, a sleeve, or even a curtain.Don’t cook with long, draping sleeves, keep appliances a safe distance from curtains and towels, don’t hang anything above your stove, and never put towels or aprons on a hot cooking surface.

, Toasters and toaster ovens can be notorious for setting on fire because there's a build-up of crumbs inside. Keep your appliances clean and food-free to prevent remnants from catching fire. This includes:Toasters and toaster ovens
Ovens
Microwaves
Pots and pans
Elements and cooktops

, Some kitchen appliances are specifically designed to perform certain functions, and you shouldn’t try to find novel uses for them. For instance, some people claim you can turn a toaster on its side to melt cheese, but this will very likely result in a toaster fire.Always read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions when using an appliance.

, Make sure that everything is well away of the fire-prone places, such as dryers and chimneys. It is recommended that you add a screen at the fireplace in the family room to prevent chimney fire. Make sure that you throw out the dust filter that filters the clothes in your dryer. You should do this monthly, or after 10 sets of clothes. Also check to see if any pipelines that connect the dryer aren't clogged. If you do find a clot, do not use the dryer, and call a plumber. If you need to dry clothes, dry them on a clothes-hanger outside at your deck.

, Make sure that you have 2 exits out of your house when the fire comes. Discuss with your family on where to go from every room that is frequently used (e.g. Bathroom). Sound an alarm to do some drills with your family, and that you are confident with it.

Remain calm.,
Protect your airways.,
Determine three courses of action.,
Head for non-flammable terrain.,
Avoid high-burn places.,
Hunker down if trapped.",How to Survive a Wildfire1," The situation is extremely dangerous, but panicking will only hinder your ability to adapt to the situation and survive.Breathing techniques are an excellent way to keep calm, if the air is not too smoky already. Take a deep breath in for four seconds, then exhale slowly for four seconds. Repeat until you feel more calm and in control, but again, if the air is already smokey you should not take deep breaths.Remain confident in your ability to escape and survive. Your mental condition will be an important factor in determining your ability to make it out alive.;
, This is the most important thing you can do to ensure your safety. Even if the fire continues to advance, you still have a chance of escaping if you can breathe. As soon as you start inhaling smoke and carbon monoxide, you're going to risk passing out and dying.Stay low to the ground.Cover your nose and mouth with a wet cloth, and hold it there until you get to safer grounds.If you are hiking, you should have water and some type of cloth with you, like a bandanna. Pour water over the bandanna and use it as a makeshift ""respirator"" until you escape.

, If time and your mental condition allow it, try to formulate three different escape plans. Then you can quickly assess each of the options to find the most advantageous escape route, and if the situation changes and you need to adjust your plans you will already have two backups.Remember that the most dangerous places to be in relation to the fire are uphill from the flames and downwind from the fire. Try to stay upwind of the fire at all times.Use the wind as a guide. If the wind is blowing past you and toward the fire, then run into the wind. If the wind is behind the fire and blowing toward you, run perpendicular to the fire so that you are escaping both the actual flames and the course they will blow towards.Remember that winds can carry sparks and start new mini-fires up to one mile ahead of the existing flames. Do not allow yourself to become surrounded by fire., If at all possible, head for the nearest, biggest area that is unlikely to burn. While the fire is probably wide and sweeping, it needs combustible material like trees, brush, and tall grass to burn.Look for nearby areas that are free of trees and brush. If you can put a water body between you and the fire, do so.Places which have already burned are sometimes the safest place to go, if you do not have any other options. However, you should ensure that the area is completely extinguished before proceeding, as lingering fires could cause burns and breathing problems., As you flee the fire, you'll need to avoid places that could leave you trapped once the fire advances. If at all possible, avoid areas choked with a lot of vegetation, as these will almost certainly burn.Low-lying areas are generally considered safer, if there is not a lot of vegetation there.Stay away from canyons, natural ""chimneys,"" and saddle-like ridges. These areas leave very few options if the fire suddenly spreads around you, and a canyon could leave you trapped in a dead end., If the fire surrounds you, or if there is no place safe to head toward, your safest option may be to hunker down in an area that will not burn. However, if you are able to continue fleeing the fire and heading toward safety, you should do so.


If at all possible, take refuge in a building or vehicle.If you are near a body of water, like a river or pond, seek safety in the water or use it to keep some distance between you and the fire. Fire will not burn across the water, unless it is a narrow creek with a lot of overhanging trees.If you are near a road or ditch but cannot follow the road to safety due to the width of the fire, you may be safest using the road as a barrier. Unless there are overhanging branches, the fire will take time to spread across the pavement. If you become trapped, lie face-down on the pavement as far from the fire as you can get. If there is a ditch on the far side of the road, lie in the ditch face-down.When you hunker down, try to cover your body with anything that will protect you from the fire. Wet clothing or a wet blanket are useful, but in a pinch even covering the back of your body with soil or mud may help keep you cool in the intense heat.Stay down until the fire passes."

Do not throw any other baking product on the fire, such as flour.,
Do not move the pot with the grease fire anywhere.,
Whenever you're heating oil or grease, stay in the kitchen.,
Use a heavy pot with a lid.,
Clip a thermometer to the side so you know the temperature of the oil.",How to Put out a Grease Fire," The safety of you and your family is far more important than the safety of your house. If the fire is still small enough and contained in one pot, it is safe to put it out yourself. If it is already spreading to other parts of the kitchen, get everyone assembled outside and dial for emergency services. Do not place yourself in the way of harm.;
, This is your first priority, given that a grease fire needs heat to stay alive. Don't try to move the pot. You might accidentally splash yourself or your kitchen with burning oil.


If the grease fire is unruly or you feel like you have enough time, put on some oven mitts to cover susceptible skin. That way, any spattering grease isn't likely to hurt you if it does come in contact with your hands.

, Before doing this, if your clothing is flammable or dangling, remove it. The following items are suitable for placing over the pot:


Place the lid of the pot back on with an oven mitt. The easiest way to smother a grease fire is to cover it with a pan lid. With the lid on (and the heat off), the fire should quickly consume all the oxygen and put itself out. Do not use glass lids; they can break from the extreme heat of open flame.
Place a cookie sheet over the lid.

, Baking soda will put out small grease fires, but won't work as effectively on larger ones. It will take a large amount of baking soda to get the job done.

, If you have a chemical fire extinguisher on hand, it's plenty fine to use it on your grease fire. Although it can contaminate your kitchen, it's a good idea if the extinguisher is the last line of defense between you and a burned down home.

, Call emergency services if you're too afraid to go near the fire or don't know what to do. Do not risk life and limb to save a kitchen.

, This is the number one mistake many people make with a grease fire; it will only succeed in making things worse. Water and oil don't mix. In this case, their mixing will create a disaster.


Because water is heavier than oil, it immediately sinks to the bottom of the pan. (Water and oil are not soluble.) There, it becomes super heated and evaporates quickly; this evaporation expands rapidly, pushing and splattering the burning out in all directions., You’re likely to fan the flames and spread the fire. Don't place a wet towel over a grease fire to snuff out the oxygen, either.

, Flour might look like baking soda, but it won't react the same. Only baking soda can help put out a grease fire.

, Another common mistake people make is trying to move the pot with the grease fire over to another location, perhaps outside, where the fire isn't likely to do as much damage. This is a mistake. The act of carrying out the burning oil can cause it to spill, potentially burning you or any other flammable object it comes into contact with

, It pays to be aware. Most grease fires happen when someone steps out for a ""moment"" and completely forgets about the burner heating the oil to oblivion. Stay in the kitchen to avoid this fate. You should be able to smell the acrid grease before it lights up into a conflagration.

, Cooking with a lid both contains the grease and cuts it off from its would-be oxygen supply. Of course, a grease fire can erupt with the lid still on the pot, but it's less likely to happen.

, Keep an eye on the oil as it's heating. Again, if you see wisps of smoke or smell something acrid, immediately turn down the heat or remove the pot from the burner completely. The oil won't immediately catch fire once it starts smoking, but smoke is a danger sign that it's well on its way to getting there.

Turn on the electricity.,
Test your new smoke detector.",How to Replace a Smoke Detector," There should be at least one detector on every floor of the house, including finished attics or basements. You may even have multiple smoke detectors on each floor, so make sure to check every room.;
, The location of the manufacture date should be easy to find but varies by model. If you find a smoke detector that is over 10 years old, you should replace it immediately. If you can't find a manufacture date on the smoke detector, the detector is probably over 10 years old and should be replaced., Find the button on the face of the detector and hold it for at least 5 seconds. If the smoke detector beeps, it is functioning properly. If the detector does not beep, something is wrong.You may hear all of your smoke alarms beep while only testing one of them; this is normal, and indicates the smoke detector in question is functioning properly.
You can buy an aerosol can of smoke to test your detector if you wish.

, Some smoke detectors have batteries, which should be replaced twice a year. If a unit is making a chirping sound, the batteries need replacing. Replace the batteries in the units you’ve identified as malfunctioning and re-test them. Remember that smoke detectors should be replaced every 10 years, even if replacing the batteries fixes them temporarily.To replace the batteries:



Remove the detector from the mounting. Most smoke detectors simply require a quarter turn counterclockwise. The detector should now only be attached to a few wires coming out of the ceiling or wall.

Replace the batteries. Most smoke detectors use 9V batteries. The battery compartment should be visible on the back side of the detector, remove the cover and replace the battery.

Reattach the detector. Replace the battery cover and hold the smoke detector up against the mounting. Turning the detector clockwise should reattach it to the mount.

Re-test your detector. Hold the test button for at least 5 seconds. If you hear a beep, your smoke detector is functioning properly.

, You can purchase smoke detectors online and at most department stores and hardware stores. Deciding on a smoke detector is mostly personal preference, but there are some features to know about.Some newer smoke detectors also function as a carbon monoxide detector. If you don’t have a CO detector in your house, this is a good option. It is only necessary if you use gas in the house.
Wireless smoke detectors are convenient, but they can only connect to other wireless alarms of the same model. If you’re replacing all of the smoke detectors in your house and choose the wireless option, make sure to purchase the same make and model.
Check the manufacture date. Since smoke alarms have a fairly static 10-year lifetime, buying one that has been on the shelf for two years will only give you 8 years of use.

, To do this, you’ll need to find your circuit breaker and switch off power to the smoke detector in question. This will remove the danger of electric shock resulting from touching open wires., Usually this will just involve a quarter turn counterclockwise.The unit will now be suspended from the ceiling by three wires, all connected to the detector via one plug called the wiring harness. These wires are:


Black - 120 volts
White - Neutral
Red or Yellow - Interconnect: This is the wire that connects the alarm with the remaining alarms in your residence.

, Squeeze both sides of the plastic plug while pulling the plug away from the detector. The old detector should now be completely detached.

, Take a screwdriver and remove the two screws that hold the mounting plate to the electrical box in your ceiling. Be careful not to accidentally pull the wires out of the ceiling while removing the mounting plate.









It’s always worth checking to see if the existing mounting plate will work with your new unit before you replace it.

, Start by removing any electric tape or wire caps that are attached to the wiring harness. Untwist the wires and remove the wiring harness. The three wires in the ceiling should now just be exposed metal ends.







, If you haven't done so already, make sure to turn the appropriate circuit breaker to the “off” position.

, The new smoke detector should also come with a wiring harness very similar to the one you removed. Match the wires and attach them by twisting the metal ends around each other. Wrap the newly attached metal ends in electric tape or attach a wire cap. Attach the wires in the following manner: black to black, white to white, and red or yellow to the color of the third wire in your ceiling (this color can vary).








After attaching the wires, pull down slightly on the wire harness to make sure you have a good connection that can support the weight of the alarm. If the wire harness comes undone you will need to reattach the wires, making sure to wrap them tightly around each other.
If there are only two wires, you may only need to attach black to black and white to white.

, Take the new mounting plate that came with the new alarm and pass the wiring harness through the large hole in the center of the plate. Then screw the plate into the ceiling/wall with the two screws that you removed earlier.

, Plug the wiring harness into the new detector, and then attach the smoke detector to the mounting plate. This can most likely be done by holding the detector up on the mounting plate and turning the detector clockwise.









If your smoke detector is battery powered, don’t forget to install new batteries before you attach it to the mounting plate.

, When you switch the circuit breaker back on, you may hear a beep from your newly installed smoke detector.

, All smoke detectors have a “test” button, sometimes it is the only button on the face of the detector. Press and hold the button for at least 5 seconds, and you should hear a beep.If you have other working smoke alarms in the house, they may all beep. This is a sign that you connected your new smoke alarm properly.
If the smoke detector does not beep when tested, check that you matched the wires properly and that they are sufficiently attached at the metal ends. Check the circuit breaker to make sure the power is on.
You can use an aerosol can of smoke to perform a real test of the detector, if desired.

Evacuate.,
Call Emergency Services.",How to Survive a Fire2," When the fire comes, you should hear the alarm go off. Make sure that when you are outside, set up a meeting place. When the smoke comes, crouch and not walk because the smoke will go up into the ceiling before coming down. The smoke contains poisonous gases that can kill you if not treated within 20 minutes.

, Call the emergency fire department that is nearest to you and say your address, city, and zip code. Be patient. It could be 15 minutes before EMS comes. After the firefighters fight the fire, your house may be completely destroyed. You will have to buy a new house, or rent a new apartment. This is the bottom line about fires.

Find a vehicle.,
Ensure that you can breathe.,
Drive if you can.,
Remain in the vehicle.,
Know what to expect.",How to Survive a Wildfire2," If you are not in your own vehicle and your choices are running on foot or using a vehicle, opt for the vehicle. It's still extremely dangerous, but will give you better odds of surviving than being on foot.If you do not have your own vehicle but find an abandoned vehicle as you flee from the fire, enter the vehicle and hotwire the car. If you need to break a window to enter the vehicle, break a rear window so that the front windows can remain closed. This is important, as it will help keep smoke out of the vehicle.
Do not break into and hot wire a car that someone is likely to come looking for. You should never take someone else's means of escaping the fire. This method is only really applicable if you find a car that someone clearly left behind to flee on foot.

, Once you're in a car, you'll need to ensure that the car is safely sealed from the smoke surrounding you. This is crucial, since you will otherwise risk passing out from carbon monoxide.


Roll up the windows and close the air vents., If the vehicle runs and you're capable of driving it, then do so. But it's important to drive safely, so that you can see your surroundings and so that anyone else on the road can see you.


Drive slowly and keep your headlights on.Keep an eye out for other vehicles and pedestrians. Stop to let any pedestrians you encounter ride along with you.Do not drive through heavy smoke. If the smoke is too thick to see where you're steering, it may be safer to park and wait it out.If you must stop the vehicle, park as far away from trees and heavy brush as possible., If the smoke is too thick to see the road, or if you cannot drive the car for any reason, you should remain in the vehicle. You will be more likely to be injured or killed by leaving the vehicle than you would be if you remained inside.Don't worry about the gas tank. Vehicles with metal gas tanks rarely ever explode. You are much safer staying inside the car than you would be on foot.Keep the windows up and the air vents closed.Lie down on the floor of the vehicle and cover yourself with a blanket or coat, if possible., Whether you are able to drive or you are forced to hunker down inside a vehicle, it's important to know what to expect so that you do not panic. Just remember that no matter what happens, if the fire surrounds the car you should not leave the vehicle.The temperature inside the vehicle will increase considerably. Don't worry - it's still safer inside the vehicle than outside.Air currents low to the ground may rock the car. Some smoke and even sparks may enter the vehicle. Don't be alarmed. Just stay low on the floor of the vehicle and keep breathing through a wet cloth to protect your airways."
"
Take any precautions you can.,
Try to wet the area.,
Stay inside.",How to Survive a Wildfire3," If the fire is rapidly approaching, you may not have time to take any precautions to protect the structure. However, if time permits, there are a number of things you can do to keep the building as safe as possible.


Shut off any and all fuel lines, including propane, natural gas, and oil.Move curtains and fabric-covered furniture away from windows and sliding doors. If the glass breaks, you do not want anything flammable near the window/door.Remove any combustible objects from the yard, especially gas grills and fuel cans, and discard them as far from your structure and any nearby structures as possible.You should also move any stacks of firewood as far from the building as possible.If time permits, trim grass and vegetation as low to the ground as possible around the building and any external propane tanks. This will help reduce the combustible material that would allow the fire to reach you or the fuel source., If the building has hoses and running water, utilize that water to create a safer structure. Remember that water may not necessarily stop a fire, but it will slow it down.


Use hoses or sprinklers to saturate the roof of the building, the walls, and the ground immediately surrounding the building.Fill any large containers present with water (if possible), and surround the perimeter of the building with them., Whether you become trapped in your home or you take shelter in a building you come across, stay inside no matter what. If the fire surrounds the building, you're more likely to survive inside than out.Close all the doors, windows, and vents in the building to prevent a draft from spreading the fire inside.Do not lock the doors to the building. If things take a turn for the worst and you need to escape, or if firefighters find the building, you'll want to ensure that the doors are not locked.Stay away from exterior walls. If the building is big enough, try to get into the middle of the structure, like a centrally-located room, so that you are as far from the exterior as possible. If you are with other people, stay together."

Cut off the oxygen of microwave or oven fires.,
Put a lid on it.,
Use baking soda or salt on grease fires.,
Always call the fire department immediately in the event of electrical fires.",How to Put out a Fire1," If something flames up in the oven or the nuke machine, stay calm. Turn off the device, close the door, and watch it closely. Closing it off and eliminating the heat source should make small fires die down quickly. Get your fire extinguisher and watch it closely.


If the fire doesn't die down, open the door very carefully and spray it with the extinguisher to put the fire out. If you have any trouble whatsoever, call the fire department immediately.
;
, If you've flamed up something in the skillet, use the lid (or a lid of larger size) to clap on quickly and smother it. This is the quickest and most effective way of stopping the fire.


Consider moving the pan outside if it's creating a lot of smelly smoke. Rinse it out with the hose when it's cooled down to keep the mess from stinking up your kitchen. Make sure you put on a heating pad or oven mitt first before trying to grab the handle.

, If you're frying bacon and the grease catches on fire, it can be a tricky proposition. You can use the lid method, or use a slightly damp towel to smother the fire, but usually the safest and quickest (though not cleanest) method is to sprinkle a liberal amount of baking soda or salt onto the grease to quickly absorb it and eliminate the fire at the source.


You should also feel free to use a fire extinguisher on grease fires. It works particularly well. Stand at a safe distance from the grease and activate the extinguisher.
Avoid using water or flour on grease fires. Flour can ignite, making the fire worse, and--since water doesn't mix with oil--water can cause the oil to spray elsewhere, throwing flaming oil onto other nearby surfaces.

, It's extremely dangerous to try to control or extinguish electrical fires yourself, because they're very difficult to anticipate and trace the source of. Get out of your home immediately, getting everyone to safety, and call the fire department."
"
Keep the fire well maintained.,
Allow the fire to burn down before extinguishing it.,
Pour lots of water onto the embers.,
Use dirt or sand as an alternative for water.,
Make sure everything is cold before leaving it.",How to Put out a Fire2," While you're enjoying a campfire, make sure to keep it manageable. Don't make it any bigger than is necessary for your group, and keep it burning steadily with large pieces of dry wood. Don't include any green or live wood in your fire and always stay close by, supervising.


Make sure the fire pit is of an appropriate size and of good quality before building your fire. Consider reinforcing pre-made metal pits by piling up dirt or rock to keep the fire housed safely and burning properly.
Do NOT burn glass, aluminum cans, or any kind of pressurized aerosol. These objects won't burn and will be extraordinarily dangerous when they heat up.

, The best way to ensure that your fire is safe to put out is to start letting it burn down and smolder long before you start dumping water onto it. If you're ready to call it a night, spread the embers out as thinly as possible and then stop stirring the fire, letting it slowly die down.


Wait until you see lots of ash accumulating where the embers were and wait for the glow to die down. Hold your hand over the fire and keep track of the heat coming off it.

, Pour water slowly, holding your bucket close to the embers. Don't throw it or dump it, which can create sudden billowing smoke and ash that can be dangerous. Aim for the embers, glowing or otherwise, pouring gently, and continue pouring your water onto the fire until the hissing sound stops entirely. Then pour a little more around just to be safe. Stir it around gently with a fire-stick or shovel to make sure its out.

, Add a more or less equal amount of sand or dry dirt to the embers and stir it around to coat the smoldering embers, putting them out. Continue slowly adding the sediment to the fire and stirring until its cold enough to touch.


Don't attempt to bury a fire. Burying a fire might let the fire continue smoldering, catching tree roots or other dry brush on fire, protecting it from elements and letting it continue on without your knowing., The embers ash and logs should be cold enough to touch before you abandon it entirely. No smoke should be coming from the fire and you should be able to detect no heat. Let it sit and check it after a few minutes to be sure.

Look at what resources are available to contain the fire.,
Use a tool to create a ""fire break"" if no water is available.,
try to extinguish the fire with water.,
Be prepared to evacuate the area if danger reaches an unacceptable level.,
Call the fire department.",How to Put out a Fire3," If you are near a source of water from a pressurized system, and have sufficient hoses available, use them to extinguish minor fires, and wet the potential fuel in the immediate area.

, Dig a shallow trench around the perimeter of the blaze, or scrape potential fuel away, exposing as much bare earth as possible. Concentrate on the area ""downwind"" of the flames, since the wind will push the blaze in that direction.


Use heavy equipment, if available, to create a larger firebreak if the situation warrants it. A farm tractor with a disk, a bulldozer, or other equipment can quickly establish a sizable fire break.

, Use buckets, pots, or other containers to carry water to the blaze if no other fire fighting equipment is available, and a stream or pond, or other source of water is nearby. If you're close enough to the brush to use a hose, take advantage of the water as soon as possible.


try to control the burn by wetting the ground in front of the direction the fire might be traveling. If it's blowing in a particular direction, watch the wind to anticipate it's motion and cut it off at the pass.

, If you must flee a fire, choose a path which can be traversed quickly and easily, away from the path of the fire. If smoke and heat becomes intense, cover your mouth with your shirt, preferably wetting it first.

, If your leaf pile has gotten slightly out of control, that's one thing, but a serious brush fire needs to be handled immediately by professionals. Use your judgment and call the fire department as soon as a brush fire escapes a manageable area or size.

Always keep a good quality fire extinguisher in your house.,
Keep your fire alarms in good working order.,
Maintain your electrical appliances regularly.,
Be careful with candles.",How to Put out a Fire4," Consider having a few in easy to reach locations and make sure everyone in your household knows how to use them. Keep one in the basement, one in the kitchen, and one elsewhere in the house, like near the sleeping quarters. They're good for several years, but get them tested out regularly and recharged to make sure they'll be ready when you need them.

, Check your fire alarms every month to make sure the batteries are in good condition and change them out regularly. Having the right warning system in place can give important extra minutes that can be the difference between an inconvenience and a disaster.

, Never overload outlets or power strips with chords. Avoid plugging in more chords than an outlet can handle to eliminate the possibility of dangerous electrical fires. Regularly unplug unused appliances to avoid needless circuits.


Use space heaters wisely. Keep flammable clothing and other substances clear of space heaters and other devices that might catch things on fire.

, More than one-third of home fires begin with candles. Please remember not to leave candles unattended and make sure they're far enough from drapes and other cloth that could start a fire. Always put them out safely and make sure candles are entirely out before you leave them unattended.


Consider using battery or electric-operated heaters in lieu of open flame candles. You can get all the aromatic benefits of burning candles without the risk of fire.

Remove all dead or unhealthy plant life on a regular basis to minimize areas that could quickly catch fire and spread.Take a look at your lawn weekly to see if it needs trimming. Look for brown tips on blades of grass as an indicator of an unhealthy plant.
Rake up and dispose of leaves, brush, tumbleweeds, and other dead plant matter as it enters your property. Do not allow it to sit or accumulate.;
, If you have lumber, firewood, or other timber around your property, store it securely in a fire resistant closed box or in a raised, open container with a fire resistant tarp as a cover. Do not store any lumber directly against the side of your house.Fire resistant storage can be purchased from an outdoor specialty store, as well as online or at most home improvement stores.

, Dead trees and scrub help a fire move faster, so it is important to remove them early and properly. If you notice a tree is browning and dying, cut the whole thing down and call your county to find out about disposal practices, or arrange for a local tree cutting company to come cut and haul the tree.Be sure to have the stump removed, as well. All of the dead wood needs to be cleared from your property.
If you live in an area where brush grows wild, remove dead scrub from your property regularly. Look around your property at least once a month and clear out any new brush that may have come in.

, Using non-flammable landscaping such as rocks, stones, or synthetic deck planks, create a fire-free area for the first five feet around the circumference of your home. Remove all leafy and piney plants as well as wooden features such as trellises immediately next to the home, and instead lay down a landscape of fire-resistant material.If you have the resources, you may consider having a deck or porch constructed around your home using fire-resistant materials.
Xeriscape the area around your house using rocks, sand, and gravel as decorative features and low-moisture plants such as succulents and cacti., Avoid flammable materials such as wood and shake shingles when putting a new roof on your house. Instead, opt for fire-resistant roofing materials rated appropriate to the fire risk in your area.Contact a local roofing contractor to find out more about fire resistant roofing. Let them know, “I would like more information on making my roof safer to protect from potential wildfires.”
Opt for a tiled or steel roof if possible.

, Even when closed, windows readily let extreme amounts of heat into your home during a fire. Help ward off ignition from heat in your home by investing in heat resistant drapes or curtains, as well as non-combustible shutters for your windows.Temperature resistant window coverings can easily be found at home goods stores, as well as from specialty window treatment retailers in person and online.
Pair heat resistant fabric with non-combustible shutters for the best results. The shutter close quickly from the outside, and can help lighten the burden of the fabric.

, Most homes catch fires from embers, not from flames. Protect your home from interior ignition by installing ember resistant vents at all points where an ember could enter your home.Ember resistant vents are available through most home improvement stores. Depending upon your area, you may be able to find one readily or you may have to have the store order one for you.

, In a scenario where the physical structure cannot be saved, you can often still save your personal valuables as long as you have a good plan. The first step is deciding what is valuable. Consider what you own that you would not be able to replace if lost.Important items often include computers or hard drives with personal work or data stored on them, identification documents like passports and birth certificates, deeds, titles, and ownership paperwork, valuable art or collections, and anything of personal value like family photo albums.
Remember that this list should also include children, pets, and any other living thing that will not be able to successfully evacuate itself from your home.
Consider your spatial limitations. If you must evacuate, you will likely do so in your own vehicle and in a restricted time period. Realistically think about how much can fit in there along with the people evacuating, and how much you can load in the five to ten minutes you will have.

, If you live in a high fire risk area, it may benefit you to keep all of the valuables you want to take with you near one another. Consider storing important documents in a single fire or folder, and keep other valuable items near that folder.


Invest in an external hard drive to backup your computer, and keep the hard drive with the rest of your valuables.
Likewise, consider making copies of family photos or other items of personal significance and storing them with your other valuables.

, Invest in a fireproof safe to store your valuables in the event that a wildfire reaches your home. This way, if you do not have the chance to grab everything during an evacuation, your belongings are still secure and safe from the fire.Such safes can be purchased online or through speciality retailers. In some areas, department stores and big box stores may also carry them.

, If you see a fire without fire crews in attendance, call your emergency numbers immediately. Let them know the location and severity of the fire, as well as what danger it poses to you and your home.Never assume that a fire has been reported unless you see emergency services on site. Always report a wildfire.

, The old and very young should be evacuated straight away as the wildfire gets stronger. As a rule, houses with people there to protect them will survive far better than those without anyone.If you have a chance to evacuate when the wildlife gets serious, evacuate straight away. If you cannot evacuate you must stay at your home and strongly defend it with whatever resources you have, such as hoses and extinguishers.

, Take action to evacuate once you know there is a fire in your area. If you know there is a fire in your area, don’t wait for the police call to evacuate. You don't want to be on the roads when the fire is near. They are dangerous and crowded during a fire emergency.Put you and other people first before objects or animals. Many people get seriously injured from putting their belongings first. If you have the time, save what you can. But if not you will need to think about the safety of others in your household.

, Keep in mind that just because the fire has passed doesn't necessarily mean you are out of danger. Keep an ear on the radio or TV for fire updates, and stay on the lookout for a flare up or a renewed ember attack.


Have a local radio or TV station tuned to a news report at all times to track the progress of the fire.

, The main key to identifying tails is to stay aware of your surroundings at all time. Don't keep your nose stuck in your phone; keep your eyes up and monitoring the world around you. If you're not paying attention, you'll never know if you're being followed., When you start acting suspicious, your tail will notice and either drop back or stop in order to try again later. If you feel like you're being followed, keep acting like you don't know.

, This applies to both walking and driving. If you're walking, slow down and look in some store windows or at your phone. Make sure to keep one eye on your surroundings while doing so. If you're driving, move over to the slow lane and drive the speed limit.

, If you think you are legitimately being followed and that you are in danger, you should call the police immediately. Try to stay in crowded, public areas while you wait for local law enforcement to respond


Large crowds can help you identify the person tailing you so that you can give the description to the police.
If you call the police and a local undercover is following you, it will usually back off. If it is a state or federal officer tailing you, then they will likely get pulled over by the local police. If it is a private investigator, they may get ticketed and you may be informed as to what was happening.

, If you think you're being followed, the worst thing you can do is start running or driving erratically. Not only does this alert the people that are following you, but it can put you in danger of an accident.

, Get off at an exit and then get immediately back on the freeway. If you're walking, walk around the block once or twice. This will usually throw off the person tailing you, or at least make them aware that you're aware.

, Some people suggest that you tail the person that is tailing you in order to get a better idea of who they are, but this is generally not a good idea and can be very dangerous.

Decide where to mount your safe.,
Open the door of the safe and look for the mounting hole.,
Use a marker to make a spot on the floor where the mounting hole is found.

,
Move your safe out of the way.,
Drill a hole into the floor.,
Vacuum up any dust that is created by the drill.,
Reposition your safe over the mounting hole.,
Insert the bolt through the base of the safe and into the hole.,
Tighten the nut on top of the bolt several times using a pair of pliers.",How to Bolt a Safe to the Floor," Find a place that is hidden from view but easy to access in case you need to get to the contents quickly.;
, Most fireproof safes have the hole in the middle of the unit. Other safes will have a mounting hole or holes in the corners.

,, If you have carpet on the floor where you will be placing the safe, use a knife to cut a circle out of the carpet that is large enough to accommodate the bolt and the mounting hole.

, Use a drill bit that is appropriate for your floor. Concrete floors will need a concrete drill bit, and wood floors will require a wood drill bit.


Ensure you have the proper drill bit size. Most wood floors are 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick. For concrete floors, use the size of the bolt that comes with the safe to determine the right size of concrete drill bit. If you are unsure, take the bolt to a hardware store and ask a sales associate for the right one.

, Run the vacuum over the hole to catch any dust that is inside of it.

, Line it up so that the hole in the safe sits directly over the hole in the floor.

, You may need to hammer the bolt 2 or 3 times in order to fit it into the hole.

, This will expand the sleeve on the bolt and fasten to the walls of the floor. Keep turning it until it is tight and unable to turn any further.

Understand how spy software works.,
Check your phone's behavior.,
Monitor your battery.,
Check for background noise during calls.,
Look for strange texts.,
Check your data usage.,
Check for a jailbreak.,
Use misdirection.",How to Check if You Are Under Surveillance2," Spy software is installed on smartphone without the user's knowledge. It can then send back GPS location, phone conversations, text messages and more. It is incredibly unlikely that your phone has spy software installed on it by a malicious party, but these steps will help you make sure.

, Is your phone acting oddly? Is it lighting up when you're not using it, shutting down randomly, or making beeping noises? All phones will act oddly sometimes, but if this behavior is consistent then you may have spy software installed.

, Many spy programs will increase the drain on your battery. It can be difficult to notice, especially since your phone's battery will naturally become less efficient over time. Look for dramatic shifts in battery life, as these will be more indicative of a program draining it.

, A lot of times, background noise is a natural by-product of low-quality cellular service, but if you consistently hear static, clicking, and beeping noises during conversations they could potentially be signs of recording software. This is because some call recording software acts like a conference call.

, Many spy programs are controlled remotely via coded texts. When the program is not functioning properly, these texts may appear in your inbox. If you are receiving texts with random collections of letters and numbers, your phone may be infected with spy software.

, Many spy programs, especially cheaper ones, will use your service's data plan to send out the information that it collected. Use a data management app to track what apps are using data and how much they are using. If you are sending out data that you cannot account for, you may have spy software installed.

, If you are using an iPhone, the only way to have spy software installed is if your phone has been jailbroken. Look for the Installer, Cydia, or Icy apps on your Home screens. If you see any of these apps, or apps that were installed from sources other than the Apple App Store, then your phone has been jailbroken and spy software may have been installed.You can easily revert a jailbreak by restoring your iPhone. This will remove all apps that rely on the phone being jailbroken, which means all spy programs will be disabled. See this guide for detailed instructions on restoring your iPhone.

, If you feel like your conversations are being monitored by someone you know, one way to trap them is to deliberately spread misinformation. Call a trusted friend and tell them something believable but false, either about your schedule, your life, or anything else. If you later discover that people you know have come into this information, you'll know that someone was listening in."

Assume that all workplace computer use is monitored.,
Check for keyloggers.,
Install your own email tracking software.,
Use encrypted email.",How to Check if You Are Under Surveillance3," Most large companies have workplace computer use agreements that allow them to monitor the sites you visit, the emails you send, and the programs you run. Check with your IT department if you want to see the details of the agreement, but assume that nothing you do at work is private.

, Keyloggers are programs that capture every keystroke you make on your computer. They can be used to reconstruct emails and steal passwords. Keyloggers run in the background, and don't have icons in the system tray or other obvious signs that they are working.


If you are using Windows, press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Esc to open the Task Manager. Look in the Process or Background Processes section, and make note of any unfamiliar processes. Google anything that is unfamiliar to see if there are keylogging programs installed.
If you are using a Mac, open the Activity Monitor. You can find this program in the Utilities subfolder of your Applications folder. Look through all of the active processes and note any that are unfamiliar. Use Google to find out if they are malicious or not.
Keylogger processes often take up a lot of resources as they have to track a significant amount of information.

, Programs like ReadNotify embed small, invisible images in your email that allow you to see when the email was opened, where it was opened, how long it was opened for, and if it was forwarded. This can be very useful if you believe that someone is intercepting your messages, as you can track the IP addresses that open the email., If you're really worried about people reading your email who shouldn't be, you can switch to an encrypted email client. Your email will be encrypted, and only recipients that you designate will be able to decode it. It can be a bit of a hassle to set up, but is essential if you are trying to protect highly sensitive information. See this guide for instructions on setting up encrypted email.

Video tape your contents slowly and carefully.,
Go back and videotape the actual house and architecture.,
Make a notebook of all housing contents and literature that you hold in your files.,
Retain any papers throughout the house that may surmise the value of any item.,
Do not dispose of leftover cans of paint initially.",How to Protect Yourself After a House Fire1," If your video recorder is not available, then borrow one or buy one. This is a critical need. Visit every room and open every cabinet so that a count may be taken later if necessary. Closely scrutinize and document higher value items to assess the relative wear and tear. Don’t forget to closely document your furniture and its condition as mars and scraps can occur afterwards from moving and may necessitate repair. Pretend that everything was destroyed or not returned and videotape enough information to be able to document the asset. Don’t forget the basement, closets or storage areas. Use as much videotape time as needed. Have multiple copies made of the videotape to share with insurance and furniture restorers, and a base copy.;
, Pay attention to molding and trim, woodwork details, built-in stereo systems and in-ceiling speakers, closet systems, bathroom and kitchen details such as mirrors, fixtures, lighting, cabinetry, flooring & outlets. Take photographs also of every room and the furniture so that the details may be easily shared. If your camera is indisposed, then buy several instant ones or borrow one. Have multiple copies made of the videotape to share with construction personnel, insurance, subcontractors, and a base copy.

, Do not give that to the insurance contractor or insurance adjuster. Instead, make them document to you everything in the house that requires replacement before the demolition destroys the evidence so that you can concur with the listing. Make it a precondition to not demolish items that have not been documented to you yet. Sample listings are included in the appendix. If you are unsure of the model or type, remember that most manufacturers can tell the information from a serial number so notate all serial numbers in your listing of contents.

, Retain any items of value that you may want in your possession and not risk to a third party loss. Pay particular attention to jewelry, sentimental items of value, artwork, items necessary to your work/lifestyle, and items required for your financial and medical needs in your retention of materials. Take small sample remnants of the carpeting by room. Your value for carpet will be subject to whatever samples they choose to submit so retain a remnant of each room.

, Use their information to document the colors present in the various rooms of the house and exterior. Make a chart of all previous selections and use that to notate the new selections. Example is in the appendix.

Place motion sensors around the air conditioning vent.,
Mark your copper coils with spray paint.,
Lock the doors with a padlock.,
Alternatively, build a small fence around your house.,
If you have a home alarm system, get a pressure gauge for the air conditioning system.,
Join a neighborhood watch program or start one.,
If you think that you have been breached, call the police immediately.",How to Avoid Copper Theft," Many people have motion sensors by their door, but the vent to get in will be in a dark place behind your home. A sneaky dark alley is the perfect place for a criminal to sneak in.;
, A thief will be less likely to grab something with an identifying mark. You could even write a phone number or street address to make it seem important. They would not take that, for the fear of being caught.

, These can help to deter robbers, as they will not be able to get in. Make sure to put your keys in a safe place.

, A fence can prevent robbers from getting to your house. Make sure that you can still get out of your house though., If a line is cut, a pressure gauge can tell you that it has, and go off. This can be a great way to defend the copper.

, This can be a great way to educate others about the dangers of robbery. Take notice of vacant properties in your neighborhood, which could be used as a meeting point for the group.

, The police can help track down the person who stole your copper, saving you thousands of dollars on buying a new one.

Remember to wear face masks, gloves, and clothes that you don’t mind throwing away and to have extras masks/gloves available for others that may need to enter the premises.,
Remove all surviving documents that detail financial information, social security information, tax files, all types of insurance files, medical files, deeds, passports, credit cards, mortgage company information, and contracts with service providers such as utilities, lawn maintenance, etc.,
Do not allow anything to be removed by others until you have documented it.,
Document your contents and furnishings immediately and then have all furniture removed as soon as possible to be able to retain the contents without the smoke odor.,
Documentation of contents is sometimes handled by an insurance professional, which is a huge time saver.,
Furniture and belongings need to be removed to a permanent storage where heat/cold, humidity, and environmental factors are controlled.,
If you don’t have call answering, you might want to call your phone company and get this placed on your phone so that your messages may be retrieved.,
If you have pets, try to see if another family can care for them during the crisis.,
Your house and contents may not be secure since the electricity will be turned off and the garage may be accessible manually.,
Place flashlights in your car and home by the entry.,
Remember that the stress can build without you realizing it.,
Consult information on line –use the local library if you lost your computer.,
Don’t worry about thanking others right away.",How to Protect Yourself After a House Fire2," You should insist that everyone that enters the house wear hard shoes, especially teenagers and kids who might often wear flip flops. If there is structural damage or evidence for subrogation, do not allow others to enter at all.

, Remember to take your address book, calendar/daytimer, folders that detail necessary committees or activities of your children, a phone directory of both white and yellow pages, a notepad for writing to-do lists and insurance information, bills/invoices, and office working papers. Eventually you may need to go back for more office files or other items. If you feel that your personal data was compromised, consider buying identity insurance. It provides peace of mind.

, See notes on documenting contents and construction.

, Smoke will infiltrate the wood, fabric, and materials but can and will dissipate. The contents may be able to be completely restored if items are removed quickly, items are dusted and/ or cleaned, they have been able to sit in a clean environment for a month or two, they receive ozone treatment, or they are special wiped or cleaned by professionals. Usually furniture fabrics need to be reupholstered, but check for zippers and removable fabrics that may allow them just be dry cleaned.

, The does not preclude the need to videotape, photograph, and record serial numbers of appliances and construction details. This is a huge timesaver though because everything must exist in a written form eventually and this is a very arduous process. Your insurance professional may use a recorder to dictate and then have a clerical person transfer the notes. If you have to document the findings, then have a two-person system of helpers. One person handles the item and gets a little dirty. The other person records the item, possibly using a laptop computer to input notes or an expedient system for recording. Don’t be shy in taking a photograph of anything valuable for retention. Document everything – even “junk.” You may want to review your video documentation to make sure of its accuracy. Write down all electronic information (include model and style and serial number) that you can obtain from the items or from empty original container boxes such as iPods, televisions, stereo systems, computers, kitchen appliances, etc.

, These can affect your electronics, antiques, artwork and other contents. Temporary storage may be needed as an intermediary such as a pod outside the house, but not on a long term basis. All belongings are to be moved by professionals and insured for the move. A complete listing by box and item should be given to you. However, be wise to how they “administrate” the paperwork. Moving companies will often notate that there are scratches or mars on every single aspect and side to every single piece of furniture. That is the industry so that is why you have to protect yourself with photographs or video showing the condition of each piece. Also, be wary of the designation of “PBO” as packed by owner. Have the moving company or contracting firm state in writing that the contents were not packed by the owner but rather packed by others and it will be fully insured at their liability for destruction.

, If you have a cell phone, evaluate your contract for the amount of minutes that you may be limited to and increase it significantly.

, If the pets can not be relocated or adopted, consider contacting your local Humane Society for help. If the pet(s) are not intrinsic to your family structure such as lab mice or a lizard or turtles or rabbit or other possibilities, the Humane Society often finds new homes for pets and may be able to assist you.

, Others may have heard of the fire on the police blotter or the local papers that report fire calls. You may want to secure the garage with additional clamps so that it cannot be opened and only a key will suffice for the door. If your builder uses a “builder’s code” on a lockbox situation, demand a code that you have set yourself so that everyone cannot have access without prior authorization. These codes exist for years and are known by all past subcontractors and employees that may or may not be known or approved for entry.

, You will need to enter and there won’t be lights without electricity. Check to make sure all utilities except the phone are off and ask for them to be winterized to prevent damage. Remember that after the fire, some plastic parts that are exposed to water may need replacement due to leaking and caused by changes in the pH of the water that affects the plastic parts. Examples are toilets, water pumps, etc.

, A great stress reliever is exercise, but remember to warm up your muscles since the stress can easily cause them to be pulled.

, Access information from the Better Business Bureau, Angie’s List, and internet searches on your construction company. Consult insurance adjusters and run the same searches. Anyone can have a token reference basis – do more investigative research and don’t sign a long term contract without your own research. Access advice from the Red Cross website. Your computer will be your best friend so replace it quickly. You will need it to do all types of searches for knowledge in areas you never had to know, construction information and house selections, to name a few.

, Keep a running notebook in the car of your to-do list and carry it with you at all times.

You will get an initial check from your insurance company to handle immediate needs for food and clothing.,
It is critical that you understand your insurance company’s policy for temporary living expenses.,
You are free to use your own realtors or set of contacts to locate suitable housing.,
Recognize at the onset that all expenses will be borne by you without regard to a timely repayment of those expenses unless you mandate that the insurance company purchase the higher priced goods directly or pay you in advance.,
Transfer whatever contents you can to use in your temporary conditions such as kitchen cookware, dishes, utensils and the like.,
Make sure you understand how the fire is reported.",How to Protect Yourself After a House Fire3," Everything must be documented by a receipt starting at the onset. Keep envelopes for receipts in each category of expense – housing, temporary living expenses, contents replacement, and reconstruction. As you submit receipts, keep a typed copy of each submittal and a copy of the receipts for your own files. Keep a notebook of the categories separated by tabs that holds the paperwork for the submittal –receipts and listing. Provide submissions in accordance with your needs for reimbursement – this may vary by month or frequency of outlays. Initially, a monthly expense statement may be submitted. Once temporary living expenses settle down, then the submittals may become more infrequent and be based on dollar volume. You are eligible to receive some portion of your contents allowance. Some companies provide this upfront; others make you wait six months for it.

, Does your company offer a flat allowance/limit for all expenses or an unlimited allowance for two years? Your expenses will be deducted for the normal living expenses that you would incur without a fire, such as typical food expenses for both eating at home and eating out, and utility expenses. The utility companies (electric, oil, gas) can provide you with the last 12 months of invoices for your home that can create an average expense.

, You are free to find suitable temporary hotel accommodations for you and your family members such that you are not situated in a flea bag hotel or four persons sharing one room. You are free to dine where you normally would dine. You are free to shop where you normally would shop. Do not abuse the circumstances by dining at a four star restaurant every night nor feel intimidated in purchasing a safe and adequate level of requisites for your needs in terms of housing and food.

, This is the whole waiting game of the insurance industry and its Achilles heel. If the insurance company wants to have the necessary appliances repurchased by you, then submit to them the bill and state that they can directly pay for it or provide you the check in advance. This same argument may be made for all types of things including pre-purchase of utility rates/contracts, hotel expenses and major temporary living expenses, and larger repurchases relative to items needed to replace or reconstruct your home/contents. Unless you have an extra $50,000 to $100,000 in liquid assets that does not require your usage for a year or two, this will be necessary.

, For any repurchases such as electrical appliances (hairdryers, coffee pots, etc.) remember to buy the quality that you will need when you are placed back into the house. There is not an allowance for any temporary appliances.

, Get a copy of your local fire report. Ask your agent how it is “marked” on the file. This may affect your ability to be covered in the future.

Be sure to have a written contract that states that substitutions for preexisting materials cannot be made without prior written approval and dissemination of information.,
Have a written contract that mandates that all materials will be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s warranty instructions, unless information is disseminated and approved in writing on an exception basis by the homeowner.,
You are eligible in most cases to receive services within your county of jurisdiction so that you need not be pressured into working with vendors that are far away or areas that do not represent your current level of quality and servicing.,
The construction company will show you (if you hire them directly) or the insurance company (if it is one of their preferred suppliers) a proposal for reconstruction.,
Ask for a schedule of their activities in a rough approximation.,
Carefully document your selections in writing to avoid any misunderstanding.,
Many insurance contractors will advocate that they can “master all trades” and be the contractor for every aspect of the renovation.,
Ask for the right upfront to be able to discuss needs with subcontractors as the work proceeds with the general contractor present.

,
Do not allow the contractor to put up an exterior lawn sign of his business in plain view of anyone riding or walking by, especially if it is a known national insurance contractor franchise.,
If your contractor states that some aspect of construction has a problem that has evolved, make sure to have the contractor take ownership of the recommended course of action to remedy the situation.,
As you sign off on selections, make sure that you identify that you have signed for the selection in general but not the measurements or technical aspects of having the selection installed.,
Insist that all workers be insured and free of prior convictions.,
Get a mechanics waiver of lien prior to final payment for the reconstruction.

,
Consider having a construction management advisor for several visits as repairs proceed to double-check the work and quality.

,
The biggest damage afterwards from a fire is the damage from the water and potential mold that may takes years to creep in.",How to Protect Yourself After a House Fire4," Also, state contractually that no additional obligations will be incurred without prior written quotation and approval for any upgrade or change. Contractors could charge you whatever rates they would like for any deviation or nuance otherwise. Some families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and never realized that they would owe a dime since it was a one-for-one replacement in their eyes.

, Otherwise, all those new warranties are made futile and not enforceable. Thus, place this onus squarely on the contractor.

, Thus, if you live in a nice suburb in Connecticut, you are not obligated to be serviced by a vendor that is located in a rat infested area of the Bronx or a company that is going out of business. (Don’t laugh—it happens!)

, This needs to be carefully checked for the specifications listed. Remember that there are critical aspects that can make huge differences in your cost and values that you may not normally evaluate. Interior and exterior doors can vary widely be width, style, solid wood/hollow/ or particle board filled, finish, etc.—check the details and ask the construction firm to walk through the proposal on-site with you. Ask to see any items in the proposal that are important to you before construction. The proposal is based on the construction firm’s quotation of materials; they should be able to show you the actual material proposed either on-line or on-site at the location inclusive of doors, windows, cabinetry, etc. Do not approve the proposal without seeing the larger elements or the details in advance of the manufacturer, selection, etc. Do not allow the contractor to tell you that you cannot access the information yet for any reason – or that it doesn’t exist. If they have quoted it, then it exists on paper and they must be made to be forthcoming.

, Insist that any selections by you that are needed must be outlined at least two weeks in advance to allow proper timing and consideration.

, Consider an appliance worksheet (example in appendix) that notates the previous appliance and selected replacement inclusive of model numbers and styles. E-mail is a great expedient way to confirm choices in written form. This makes the contractor liable for the informed choice/selection and also makes you liable for the clarity of the decision. Any written selections that need further clarification should ask for them in writing.

, Their subcontractors are skilled in many disciplines such as carpentry, plumbing, flooring, painting, roofing and the like. Their skills and subcontractors may not lend themselves to being a complete expert in unique or more skilled areas such as placement of video cameras for security equipment and monitoring, hi-level stereo system design and installation, expert marble work, restoration of valuable antiques, or handling of unique areas of restoration that are not mainstream. These are areas where you might want to insist upon a separate entity by your designated selection to obtain the previous existing quality.

,, The reason is that these contractors all have a “known” code to enter any and all of their homes, so any construction worker that ever worked on any project of theirs has now been given the “keys” to your house. They can enter at any time, and the premise is not secure. If there are any contents of value, any appliances to be installed, or any installed items that are damaged, then the liability becomes an issue, not inclusive of any liability if the trespasser gets injured on your property.

, Some contractors will advocate that you need to make the call of how to best remedy the leaking roof, for example. The right answer is that they are the general contractor and responsible for providing a dry roof. It is not your onus to understand and research the best construction techniques and make technical decisions – they own the liability for the decision.

, For example, the windows and doors selections may include the type and brand, but the contractor is responsible for the measurement and proper fit. Again, this may seem obvious but some contractors will try to unload as much responsibility as possible. Don’t fall for it.

, Insist on a copy of the contractor’s total coverage and make sure that it is adequate for your purposes.

,,, Most reconstruction firms will have a caveat for this since they don’t want to be held liable and your insurance firms are typically limiting their liability too. Pay particular attention to areas where water was displaced and how the area is being handled. You would prefer complete removal for these areas and new build./wood/materials.

Before you start talking to vendors, ask yourself these questions:


How many locations do I want to watch?,
Find out the format of the camera.,
Ask for measurements of horizontal TV lines, or TVL.,
Research the CCD.,
Find out about the lenses.,
See if there are 'remote handling' capabilities.,
Consider housing for your cameras.,
See if it comes with DVR capabilities.",How to Buy the Most Suitable CCTV Security System,"
Where will I mount the cameras?
Where will the central recording device be set up?
Will the cameras be monitored live, or only played back if there's been a problem?
What is the lighting like in your target areas?
Do you need physical protection for the cameras?
How long do you need to save your recordings for?;
, One of the most basic specifications of CCTV systems is the format of the camera and lens. 1/4"" and 1/3"" cameras are by far the most popular for security work, and they should do the job for you, too. Make sure the lens you get match the format of the camera.

, 380 is low-end, 420 is good for security work, 480 and 540 is very high quality. If you're going to see detail, upgrading to a higher resolution is a good choice.


Do make sure that all of your equipment can handle the resolution your cameras put out, though. It's no good having a 540 TVL camera while your monitor only displays 420.

,


Older CCTV security systems were often black and white to save money, color cameras were more expensive. These days, there's hardly any price difference, and color video is far more effective for identifying suspects and pinpointing problems. The one remaining advantage of black and white cameras is that they work better in low-light situations. But now, color cameras always switch to a black and white mode in low light to improve results.

,


Most video surveillance cameras are installed in one location permanently. For this case, fixed-focus lens are the most cost-effective. If you want to be able to move your camera, vari-focal lens are adjustable, letting you change your field of view when you reset the camera.

, If you want to be able to control the camera remotely, you'll need a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) camera. They can cost 10 times as much as a standard fixed camera, though, so make sure you really need one before spending the money.

,


There are two main reasons to get housings for your cameras: protection from vandalism, and protection from the elements. The placement of the camera will determine what you need: if your cameras will be mounted indoors and far out of reach, you may not need any housing at all, while outdoor cameras may need impact-resistant coverings and heaters.

, Digital video recorders (DVRs) have replaced VCRs as the workhorses of the video surveillance industry. While they are still somewhat more expensive than VCRs, their advantages are immense.


One of the most significant is their ability to adjust to what they see: if they're recording a static image, such as the inside of a warehouse at night, they may only record 1 frame every 5 or 10 seconds. But when they detect movement, they can instantly switch to full video to capture any suspicious activity.
Because they record to hard drives, you can instantly watch any specific time – with no lengthy fast-forwarding and searching for the right moment. They also let you jump to 'events' – situations where the picture changed. And don't overlook the fact that they don't have tapes; you won't have to worry about storage or tapes deteriorating.

, These can be bought relatively cheaply and installed by yourself or a professional. Be sure to notify your home insurance provider as your premium may well go down as a result.

, Most insurance companies are happy with one Kitemarked to British Standard BS3621.

, And whatever you do, don’t leave the keys on a piece of string.

, Nothing advertises an empty post than a pile of junk mail on a doormat.

, Outbuildings and garages are particularly vulnerable and will often be starting place for opportunistic thieves looking for a screwdriver or crowbar. Make sure they’re securely locked.

, Most burglars will be deterred by an alarm. You should avoid cheap models, though, as false alarms are a nuisance to you and your neighbours. If you have or are getting an alarm, make sure to test it periodically and ensure that it meets British Standard BS4737 or BS6799 (wire-free) or the new European Standard EN50131-1.

",How to Avoid Home Break Ins / Thefts," This makes it incredibly easy for a criminal to steal items, without difficulty of getting them out of the home (except some furniture); and without leaving visible evidence of the theft, that a neighbor can see from the outside of the home.;
,, By placing valuables in plain-sight; such as having valuables in locations that abut a window, especially on the first floor of the home (i.e. large television or computer system directly behind the large front windows of your home.).

, Be careful of who is knowledgeable of your valuables. By bragging (or telling) about your valuables, even to people you believe are not going to be the burglars; you increase your risk of a home invasion. Even if they are completely innocent, they could possibly tell somebody who is not as upstanding. For those who post information of what they own online, you should also be careful.

, However, in city environments, these can provide additional security to your home. Invest in a quality alarm, preferably with a cellular backup (because it is quite easy for a criminal to disconnect phone wires leading to your home). Be sure to turn it on, especially in the following situations:


You leave your home, and nobody is there. Even if you are only gone for a short period of time.
When you are home alone.
When you are sleeping.

, By removing vegetation that makes it difficult for others to see around your home, you lower the risk that they can make a silent entry.

, If that garage has windows, be sure to put shades or blinds over them; so criminals cannot see what kind of transportation they can steal.

Learn to spot a fake.,
Shop at reputable retailers.,
Be careful when shopping abroad.,
Keep up with recalls.,
Report suspected counterfeits.",How to Avoid Buying Counterfeit Products," Don't rely on retailers or the government to protect you from counterfeit products. The sheer quantity of these products makes this nearly impossible. The most important tip? If a deal is too good to be true, the product is probably fake. Check out the related wikiHow for more tips on how to spot a fake.;
, Counterfeit goods do make their way onto the shelves of even the largest, most established stores, but less reputable retailers are far more likely to sell counterfeit products. Discount retailers, such as ""dollar stores,"" are easy targets for suppliers of counterfeit goods because these stores often sell an ever-changing variety of lower-quality items and cater to customers who are very price-conscious. Small stores that sell a dizzying array of (mostly) junk are also prime outlets for counterfeits, especially those stores that haven't been in business for very long.


Shop at authorized retailers. Many companies, particularly those that sell appliances, electronics, and luxury goods, sell only through authorized retailers. You can find out if a retailer is authorized to sell a certain brand by calling the manufacturer or checking its website.
Thrift shops, fairs, and flea markets are great places to get used and handmade items, but you should be very wary of new brand-name goods at these types of venues. While you can find legitimate bargains on used goods, it's also a good idea to carefully examine any used product, such as tools or electronics, that could pose a safety hazard.
Be particularly careful when buying online. Online auction sites are rife with counterfeits, and since you can't inspect the goods first, it's hard to tell what you're buying. Look for sellers with lots of good feedback, and ask questions about where they got the merchandise. Also ask for the seller's address and phone number; if they won't give it to you, there may be something amiss. Spam emails will almost always direct you to illegitimate sites. If you order from one of these sites, chances are you'll get fake goods--if you get anything at all. Once again, whether you're shopping online or at the corner store, be wary of deep discounts.

, You can find counterfeit products just about anywhere, but in some developing nations and in popular worldwide tourist destinations, you can be almost certain that the goods you're buying are counterfeit. Once again, if a deal is too good to be true, the product's probably a fake.

, In many developed nations, if a batch of products is found to be counterfeit, it will be recalled. Recalls are also issued for faulty or potentially dangerous products. You'll often hear about recalls in the news, but if you want to stay abreast of the latest information, your government may offer a service to help you do so. In the U.S., you can check Recalls.gov for recall information, and you can even sign up for email notifications of new recalls.

, If you see or have purchased a product you think may be a fake, contact authorities so that they can investigate. If the suspected counterfeit product could pose a danger to others, contact local law enforcement or law enforcement agencies such as the FBI (in the U.S.) or the RCMP (in Canada). Otherwise, contact the brand-name manufacturer whose product has been counterfeited, or report the suspected counterfeit to one of the organizations listed in the External Links section below.

Install a home security system.,
Purchase a sign from a security company.,
Install motion sensors.,
Replace your older entry doors.,
Install strong locks.,
Purchase a fireproof safe.,
Relocate any hidden keys.",How to Protect Your Home When You Are Away1," Standard home security alarms generally include sensors on all entry doors, sensors on easily accessed windows, and some motion activated sensors for outdoor spaces. They are also a direct link to a monitoring service. These systems act as a deterrent for intruders and are fairly easy to use..


You can have a home automation system installed that allows you to access a security system through a smart phone or computer application. Often a full security system would include outdoor cameras, automated lighting and an alarm and monitoring system. These provide peace of mind whenever you’re far away from your home.
Installing a home security system may also reduce your homeowners’ insurance payments.;
, If you have chosen to purchase and install a home security system, consider purchasing a sign from a different company. Some homeowners worry that advertising their home security system will clue burglars in how to trick the system. If you put up a sign from a different company, you eliminate this risk. Even if you did not install a security system, you can still find a sign to put up in your yard, because it may be enough to scare any potential burglars away.
You can easily find these signs on most resale websites or auction websites.

, This is applicable for homeowners rather than for families living in apartment buildings. If you have outdoor spaces, consider installing motion sensors that turn on a light when someone moves close. Consider adding motion sensors by any entryways like those on porches, decks, and by garages.


Ensure that the light on the sensor is bright enough to draw attention to anyone attempting to enter the home.

, Strong doors are a worthwhile investment as a deterrent for robberies. Ideally, they will be over 1 inch thick and be made of metal. Hardwoods are also a good option. Your door should be strong enough that no one can break it down or kick it in. Not only will this increase security, it will also improve your home's energy efficiency.Good locks are useless if your door is easily broken!This may not be possible if you are renting your home or live in an apartment. If this is the case, speak with your landlord to see if they will consider installing more secure doors.

, Consider adding a dead bolt or an extra strong lock to entry way doors. If you have sliding glass doors, install locks that wedge between the door and the track to ensure they cannot be opened from the outside.


If you have window screens, add security latches to the screen. Window screens can be easily opened, but this latch adds another layer of protection.

, A safe is a necessary investment for every homeowner. You should keep your essential documents here, like the deed to your home, your passports, and identification cards whether you are home or away.Before you leave, lock up any valuables that you may keep out on an everyday basis, like jewelry or sensitive documents.

, Many of us have a hidden key to our front doors or garages tucked away under a welcome mat, in a plant, or in a decorative garden item. Retrieve the hidden key and put it somewhere safe inside your home.


Since you’ll be away, there’s no reason for a hidden key to be outside. Most burglars know that homeowners will hide keys and will look for one that is easily accessible when they want to break in.

Ask a friend to monitor your home.,
Ask a friend to maintain your yard.,
Install programmable light switches.,
Do not post online.,
Stop your mail.,
Leave window coverings the same.",How to Protect Your Home When You Are Away2," Ask a trusted friend, family member, or neighbor to keep an eye out on your home while you’re away. It is absolutely essential that you trust this person and know that they will follow through with checking in.A next door neighbor is a convenient person to monitor your home since they are the most likely person to notice any unusual situations.
Do not sacrifice convenience for trust. If you do not feel completely comfortable asking your next door neighbor to check on your home, ask a close friend or family member.
Remember to return the favor and offer to do the same for them when they are on vacation.

, Overgrown lawns or driveways full of snow are surefire giveaways that the homeowner isn’t at home.


Be mindful of your friend’s time and offer compensation for these chores. For example, if the neighbor that you’ve asked to keep an eye on things has a teenage son or daughter, offer to pay their child to complete these tasks.
Always return the favor and offer to do the same when they go away on vacation.

, Interior lights signal that someone is at home but leaving your lights on all the time while you are away is not cost effective. A programmable light switch will turn on select lights at a certain time and then turn them off. This saves money, is energy efficient, and is a useful deterrent.


An intruder who is watching your home closely may notice that the lights go on and off at certain times every day. Set a schedule for your timers that varies day by day., Never post on social media that you are leaving for a vacation. Avoid posting pictures from your vacation while you are still away, checking in at the airport or your vacation destination, or updating your friends about your vacation.


Internet safety is extremely important. Many burglars learn about their potential victims through social media when they post that they will be away, how long they’ll be away, and where they’re going., Notify the post office that you will be away so they do not leave mail and packages at your door. You can also ask your neighbor to collect your mail for you if you prefer not to stop your mail altogether.


Avoid scheduling deliveries, like those for online shopping, for times when you are away. Packages that are left outside your front door are easily stolen and alert others that you are out of town.

, This applies to your curtains, your blinds, or shutters that cover your windows. If you typically leave your blinds open during the day, consider leaving them open when you are away. Noticeable changes can alert others that you aren’t home, like if your curtains are pulled shut for two weeks straight when they are normally open."

Check your pipes.,
Unplug non-essential appliances.,
Check all locks.,
Turn down the temperature.,
Secure your garage door.",How to Protect Your Home When You Are Away3," If you live in a cold weather area and you are leaving during a time when inclement weather is a possibility, you want to make sure your pipes are well insulated. Frozen pipes can cause significant damage to your home, and if no one is there to check them after cold weather it may go unnoticed until you return.Go into areas where pipes are at a greater risk of freezing, like the attic and the basement, and check their insulation. Consider hiring a plumber to inspect your pipes if you are worried about their insulation.A neighbor that is checking up on your house should test the faucets while you’re away. If there is no water coming from the faucets, your pipes may be frozen. Ask them to contact you immediately if this happens while you’re away.

, Before you leave, unplug the appliances in your home that are non-essential, like your microwave, a stereo, a coffeemaker, and lamps you won’t leave on.


This protects your home in the event of a power surge or an electrical fire.
This is also an energy efficient way to reduce your electrical consumption while you’re away.

, Before you leave, check that each door and window are securely locked. Having locks installed will do you no good if they are not locked while you are gone! Go through every room of your home and apartment and check that each window and entry door is secure.


It is also helpful do a perimeter of your house from the outside. Look for any window screens that look loose or unsecured.

, This is a good way to keep your electricity and natural gas costs low while you’re away. Adjust the temperature on the thermostat and turn down the temperature on your water heater.


You don’t want to turn your thermostat completely off. Depending on your area’s climate, 55 degrees is a good limit for the winter and 80 degrees for the summer.
You can also consider monitoring your heat from afar. The most cost-effective way to monitor your heat while you are away is to install a wireless thermostat that you can monitor and program from your mobile phone or device while you are on vacation.

, Garage doors are an easy way for intruders to enter your home. Manual garage doors can be secured with a clamp or padlock to prevent them from being opened.Turn off your automatic garage door opener if you have one. This will prevent someone with a universal remote from opening the door while you’re away.

Reduce flammable vegetation.,
Prune trees on your property.,
Keep combustible materials properly stored.,
Obstruct openings in structures.,
Choose fire-resistant building materials.,
Install alarms, spark arrestors, and sprinklers.",How to Protect Your Belongings in a Wildfire1," Anything that can catch on fire risks serving as fuel for a wildfire. Most often, wild fires spread by burning plants. Reduce the ability of wildfire to put you and your belongings at risk by removing any flammable plants that is within 30ft of the exterior of your home and any outlying buildings. Remove dry grass, brush piles, and any bushes next to your home. Cut down any vines that grow on any structures on your property.Keep your roof, gutters, and decks free of debris. Remove and do not use mulch next to any structures on your property.
Remove pine, eucalyptus, juniper, and fir in particular, as these are especially flammable types of trees.
If you live in on a hill, extend this protected zone to 100ft on the downhill side of your home.
Keep any remaining vegetation within 200ft of your home thin and dispersed. Remove underbrush beneath any trees or bushes.;
, Cut tree limbs that are 10ft from the ground or lower on any trees within 100ft of your home. Further, trim trees that have touching canopies. Ideally, tree canopies will be at least 15ft from one another. Have the power company come and cut down any branches that are near powerlines., Do not leave out flammable materials, such as furniture cushions, when not in use. Store propane tanks at least 10ft from any vegetation. Store woodpiles at least 30ft away from any structures. Keep trash cans at least 10ft from any structure, with the lid on at all times., If your home features open pockets of space on the exterior – such as eaves, soffits, and decks – enclose them. Even vents, entrances to crawl spaces, and areas beneath your porch should be enclosed with a tightly woven metal screen., If you plan on building a new structure or remodeling, plan to use materials that will resist fire. Class A roofing material – including tile, slate, or asphalt – or Class B pressure-treated lumber should be used when roofing structures in areas of wildfire risk. Further, any lumber used in framing a new structure should be treated with fire-retardants.Use multi-pane or tempered glass windows, and install fireproof shutters to help protect them during a wildfire.
If you are unfamiliar with these materials, speak with an architect in your area about the best materials to use. Your local home improvement stores will likely have the materials you need, or will be able to order them for you.

, Install a heat and smoke detecting alarm on every level of your home. The best locations are inside each bedroom or in the hallway outside of bedrooms, as well as the kitchen and living room. Install spark arrestors in chimneys or other fire vents, and have chimney’s inspected for debris twice a year.Consider installing a sprinkler system if your home is in an area where wildfires are common.
Test alarms once a month and change the batteries annually.

Evacuate before an oncoming fire arrives.,
Clear your driveway.,
Dress in protective gear.,
Close exterior vents.,
Position stores of water around and within your home.,
Unroll and position garden hoses.,
Position an aluminum ladder against your roof.,
Back your car into your garage.,
Go inside when the fire arrives.,
Close all doors and windows.,
Stay inside until the fire passes.",How to Protect Your Belongings in a Wildfire2," You, your family, and your pets should leave your home if at all possible before a wildfire reaches your area. If, however, you do not evacuate in time, there are several steps you can take to increase your safety and reduce damage to your property.Plan two evacuations routes before you are faced with a wildfire. Make sure everyone in your family knows what these routes are.
Whenever unsure, begin your evacuation process and leave the area via a route that takes you in the opposite direction of an oncoming fire. Do not contact emergency services during a wildfire to ask whether you should evacuate – simply do so.

, Make sure any emergency responders will be able to access your home. Since emergency vehicles are often wide, clear the area around your driveways as well. Mark the entrance to your property if your house is away from the road. Use fluorescent spray paint if possible.Mark any water sources that emergency services may use as will. These include hydrants, ponds, pools, and wells. Make these features as accessible as possible.

, Dress in cotton and wool when evacuating or defending your home from a wildfire. Wear long pant and shirt sleeves, gloves, eye protections, and boots. Tie a dampened handkerchief around your nose and mouth., Your attic, basement, and eaves likely have vents that are usually open to improve airflow in your home. Find these vents and close them. This will reduce the likelihood of spars entering your home. Similarly, close and window shutters.As you do so, make sure anything combustible is away from your house. If you have exterior furniture, umbrellas, shade structures, or anything of the sort, bring them inside or move them away from your home.

, Fill any plastic trash cans and buckets with water and position them both outside of and inside of your home. Wet rugs or other heavy materials to beat out embers and small fires. Fill all of your bathtubs and sinks with water as well., Whether evacuating or actively defending your home, unroll all of your houses and position them in such a way that they will be able to spray as much of the exterior of your home as possible. Affix spray nozzle attachments to each hose and set them to their strongest spray setting.As you’re positioning your hoses, spray down the roofs of any structures.
Prepare any water pumps. If you have a water pump, position and prepare it for use as well.

, A fire-proof ladder can provide an escape route if the lower level of your home catches fire with you inside. Position the ladder on the side of the house away from the oncoming fire, near a window., Have the windows closed, the doors unlocked, and the keys in the ignition. Close your garage doors, but disengage any automatic openers so you will be able to open the door manually in the event of a power outage., It may be tempting to stay outside and try to keep any fires from catching on the exterior of your home. Do not do so. Go inside. Turn on a light on each room of your home. This will improve visibility if the house fills with smoke. Leave your porch and yard lights on as well.Find and carry a flashlight. This may be your only light source if your power goes out.

, Close doors within the home as well, to reduce any drafts. Open the damper on your fireplace, as this will help stabilize air pressure in your home. Close the fireplace screen and barricade it with something inflammable so it doesn’t blow open.Take down drapes and curtains. Close Venetian blinds.

, As soon as it does, go outside and check your roof. Make sure you’re wearing your protective outfit. Use the hoses you’ve positioned to extinguish any sparks. If the hoses are damaged, use water in buckets you’ve collected inside.After the roof, check the inside of your attic. Bring buckets of water with you when you do so.
Continue monitoring the inside and outside of your home for signs or smoke or embers.

Buy and update home insurance.,
Store valuables in a safe location.,
Keep important documents and mementos with you.,
Document all evacuation or fire-fighting expenses.,
Consider insuring recreational vehicles.,
Document your belongings visually.",How to Protect Your Belongings in a Wildfire3," Your home is likely your most valuable belonging. It is likely worth insuring. It is important to note that federal catastrophe grants do exist in some countries, but will likely not cover the expenses incurred from damages associated with a wildfire. Keep your home insurance policy up-to-date by making payments on time.Update your policy whenever you make substantial renovations to your home or property.
Stay informed about your policy. Speak with your insurance company annually, and check to see that stats like the size of your home are accurate after any changes.
If you are renting, considering getting renter’s insurance. You can likely bundle renter’s insurance with your car insurance for an affordable price.

, Documents and other small valuables can usually be stored in fire-resistant safes. Larger valuables, such as vehicles, should be moved to a safe location. Contact your insurance provider to enquire about whether your coverage will cover costs associated with moving any vehicles.Keep an itemized list of belongings in a fire-proof safe or offsite deposit box as well. Include photos and videos of valuable possessions, including jewelry, electronics, and furniture.

, Copy your passports, birth certificates, and insurance policies before placing them a fire-resistant safe. Place these copies in your vehicle. If you do not have a safe, place the originals in your vehicle. Put other small valuables or mementos in your vehicle as well., Keep receipts for any expenses you incur in the course of an evacuation. This may include accommodations, meals, and even toiletries. Many home insurance policies with covers these expenses for a short period if you are forced to evacuate. Be aware that your policy deductible will likely apply during a fire-related claim., If you own vehicles that you only occasionally use, or only use seasonally, you may want to insure them year-round if you live in a wildfire-affected area. For instance, recreational vehicles or antique cars may be worth insuring. You’ll also be able to more easily (and legally) move an insured vehicle before an oncoming wildfire arrives., Making an insurance claim will go more smoothly if you have a visual record of your belongings. Take photos and videos of anything you may wish to claim. At the very least, take a video of each room in your house with your phone. As you shoot the video, describe the contents of each room, highlighting expensive items.Store these files online and/or on a flash drive in an offsite deposit box.
Mention the price you paid for specific items, as well as the rough date you purchased them.
Don’t forget to video or photograph the contents of your garage or outlying structures, as well as any landscaping features.

Make sure your parents allow you to answer the phone.,
Answer the phone.,
Never call the company back at the number they give you.,
Watch out for words like:

""political surveys"" from ""non-profits"" that refuse to identify themselves.,
Use a the convenient search tool that the IRS offers.,
Ask why they are calling.,
Never give a confirmation.,
Record the call.,
Require them to identify themselves first, neither confirming nor denying your identity.,
Always verify the caller!",How to Answer the Phone if You Are Home Alone," Memorize the numbers of your parents, and a reliable person such as a close and nearby relative or trusted friend so you can answer their calls, or call them.
, Say something like: "" ___ (your last name) residence, ____ (your ---name) speaking."" If the person asks for one of your parents, tell them: ""Oh, I'm sorry, but __ (parent's name) is unavailable. Can I take a message for him/her?"" (depending on who the person asked for).


Never tell the person that you are alone! Say they are unavailable.
Do not sound scared.

Never say your name.
Ask your parents if you can hang up if a telemarketer calls. If you forget to do this and your phone is ringing right now, then just hang up.

, Use the number to look up the company and use the company's contact number to call them back. Otherwise, you may get a scam artist who tells you a valid company's name, but giving you a false phone number.

Call your parents or wait before calling them back and making any decisions by yourself.

,
""non-profit"" and ""political organization"" can be used to get around no-call lists. However, they must be a registered non-profit or political organization.

, Select the type of form (8871, 8872, or 990) and enter the organization's name. Leave everything else blank. If the search does not identify their organization then they are not exempt -- regardless of how much they lie by saying that they are exempt. The searches may return multiple organizations with similar (or same) names. This is where the address and phone number comes in. Click on the search results and see if the name and address matches the registered organization. If none of the records match, then they are not exempt and are probably a scam or fraudulent caller., Replies should be very specific. For example, if they are calling about your credit card, if they are legitimate, they should be able to tell you the name of the issuing bank and the last few digits on the card. Anything less specific is a scam -- just hang up., This is really an important lesson and a hard habit to break. Never give any kind of positive confirmation on the phone until you are absolutely certain who you are talking to. This includes saying ""yes"". Say ""This is he/she"", instead. The scammer can record the call, edit the recording, and use your innocent 'Yes' to authorize them for whatever they want or switch your long distance carrier., Ask the questions ""Who is calling?"" or ""What is your address?"", and see if they hang up. Tell them that you are recording the call. Regardless of whether the call is really being recorded, tell them it is being recorded. Real companies with real offers won't mind being recorded. Real surveys do not require privacy. If they hang up, then it is a scam.

Buy a small device that taps the audio from the telephone and brings it into the audio port on a computer.

, After they identify themselves, you can acknowledge yourself, gather more information about them without identifying yourself, or just hang up., Ask for their contact information: phone number and street address. Try to be near a computer and look up their address and phone number while they're still on the line. If it's a real company, they will happily give you their contact information. You can even be polite, while asking them for their phone number, extension, and what this is regarding. Then let them know that you will call them back. There's a couple of different possible outcomes from this request:

Helpful compliance. A real company will happily give you all of their contact information. Entering the phone number into Google will identify the company. Calling the company's official support phone number (which is not necessarily the number the caller gave you) will direct you back to the caller or to someone else who can help you with the same issue.
Stay on the line. A few callers will give you their contact information, but really want you to stay on the line. ""There's no need to call us back. I can help you right now!"" This is a clear indication of a scam. Real companies want you to call them back. Sales calls are more likely to make a sale if you call them. And banks get a thrill when customers practice real security by calling back on the bank's official support number. If the caller pressures you to stay on the line, then it is a scam.
No info. A solid 50% of cold calls that I receive won't give me their contact information. If they won't give me their contact information, then they are not legitimate. Period.
Or you can just muffle the phone or click dismiss to ignore the phone.

Take precautions beforehand.,
Ask yourself if you're expecting anyone around that time.,
Look out a window to see who it is.,
If you don't know or trust the person at your door, consider arming yourself.,
Ask who it is, and have them verify their identity if they claim to be a worker or salesman.,
If the visitor is unwanted, tell them to leave.,
Agree on a code word with your family and friends, and use it to ensure visitors can be trusted.,
If nothing else, just ignore it.",How to Answer a Knock on the Door," These can be as simple or complex as you'd like. Keep in mind the type of neighborhood you live in; if you live in a part of town that is known to have crime, some or all of the below precautions may be necessary, whereas in a ""safer"" neighborhood they may not be.


Install a security camera. This will allow you to see anyone that comes to your door before you open it, and will also deter burglars. Even having a fake camera can scare away thieves if you aren't willing to pay for a real one. If you do install a security camera, putting up a sign indicating video surveillance is a good idea, and may be even be required in certain areas.
Install an intercom speaker system. It is actually less expensive than you a think, and is a good way to safely communicate with people at your door without actually opening it.
Get a secure door chain if you don't already have one. This will allow you to speak to strangers through a small gap rather than open the door all the way. Make sure it is securely mounted with long screws so it will hold in case someone tries to push their way inside. The standard screws that come with the door chain are often too short and weak to withstand force.
Get a dog. Mean-looking or barking dogs will deter any strangers with bad intentions. Burglars often don't want to deal with dogs and will avoid your home altogether if it is evident that you own one.;
, Did you make plans for your friend to come over, or arrange for the plumber to fix your leaky sink? If so, it could be them, but it is still wise to double check before opening the door. If you aren't expecting anyone, there's no need to panic. They are likely a stranger, but it could still be an unexpected visit from someone you know.

, Avoid looking out the door's window (if you have one), and instead look out an adjacent window that is away from the door. That way they can't see you, and you can safely assess whether or not you know and trust them. If you have a peephole, you can use that as a method of identification too.

, It doesn't have to be with a firearm, either. A knife, baseball bat, pepper spray, golf club, etc. could also be used. Especially if you feel uncomfortable or that the person is suspicious, having a means of protecting yourself could help you feel more secure and potentially save your life in a bad situation.

, Any valid worker or salesman should be able to verify their legitimacy with the company they represent. If they can't or refuse to do so, decline their offer and ask them to leave your property or come back later. Just because they are dressed in uniform doesn't mean you should trust them.

, For example, if a salesman comes to your door selling something and you are uninterested, just tell them ""No thank you."" If you don't trust them or don't have time to listen, you could say ""Sorry, I'm busy right now. Could you come back later?"" Be polite the first time, but if they don't listen, continue to bother you, or insist to stay, call the police.

, Make the code word something really strange that you wouldn't normally use in conversation and couldn't easily guess, like ""kangaroo"". You could even make it multiple words or a phrase, such as ""I like apple pie"" to greatly reduce the chances of a stranger guessing it. Don't let anyone inside without telling you the code word, even if they insist.

, Whether you are too busy or for some other reason unavailable to answer the door, just ignore it. Whoever is there will likely just go away and leave you alone.

Check that your home contains GFCIs (ground fault circuit interrupters) or AFCI's (Arc fault circuit interrupters), which prevent electrical shock and fire by shutting off faulty circuits.
Be careful about do-it-yourself electrical projects. Studies have shown that many home fires are caused by improper installation of electrical devices. Get appliances that spark, smell unusual, or overheat fixed.;
, Fires can destroy your most cherished personal items, your home and serious injury or death. Here are the top causes of fires:


The kitchen is the most dangerous room for fires. Cooking is the major cause for fires. The fires mainly occur in the evening between 5 and 7 pm.
Faulty or damaged electrical wires can start dangerous fires.
Incorrect use of portable heaters or appliances pose a fire threat, especially during winter mornings and evenings.
Unsupervised children playing with matches and lights can hurt themselves and others.
Discarded smoking material igniting fires at home.
Fires can occur when candles and incense burners are left unattended.

, Each room has different dangers. Teach your kids about dangers too. Remember to take extra care during the winter months when house fires are more prone.


General:

Install electrical safety switches.
Avoid overloading power points.
Switch off appliances not in use.
Check electric equipment for frayed cords.
Keep matches and lighters away from children.
Ensure central heating and air-conditioning units are checked by a qualified person annually.
Install smoke alarms and check them regularly.
Check that windows and security grilles open for an essay exit.
Keep all paths clear.


Entrance:

Keep all keys in internal locks.
Get fireproof doors.
Handles may be hot in a fire.


Living room:

Place a screen in front of open fires.
Clean your chimney or flue once a year.
Keep portal heaters away from curtains.
Ensure electrical equipment has sufficient air circulation to avoid the build up of heat.
Never leave naked flames unattended.


Kitchen:

Write an escape plan and put it in a central location.
Never leave cooking unintended.
Keep a fire blanket near the exit.
Wear clothing with fitted sleeves when cooking.
Avoid using sprays or liquid cleaners near hot surfaces as they can be highly flammable.


Bedrooms;

Don't run electrical wires under rugs.
Ensure lamps and night-lights are not touching bedspreads, drapes, or other fabrics.
Check electric blankets before putting them on the bed.
Use caution when using electric blankets.


Garage:

Store flammable liquids safely.
Don't let kids use appliances by themselves and supervise any art or science projects that involve electrical devices.
Cover any outlets that are not in use with plastic safety covers if you have toddlers or young children in your home.
Clean your gutters regularly.



, Portable space heaters substantially contribute to the increase of house fires during winter. Before plugging in your space heater, make sure you know how to use it safely:


Carefully read the directions for its use.
Never place a space heater where a child or pet could accidentally knock it over.
Never place a space heater too close to a bed, especially a child's bed.
Keep newspapers, magazines, and fabrics from curtains, clothes, or bedding away from space heaters, radiators, and fireplaces.
Heaters should be at least 3 feet from anything flammable.

, Cooking the leading cause of house fires. Fires can start when food is left unsupervised on a stove or in an oven or microwave, grease spills, a dish towel too close to the burner, a toaster or toaster oven flare-up or a coffee pot accidentally left on.


Always supervise kids while cooking and practice safe cooking habits such as turning all pot handles in so they can't be accidentally knocked over and not wearing loose-fitting clothing that could catch fire around the stove.

, Keep your fireplace clean and covered with a screen to keep sparks from jumping out. Only wood should be burned in the fireplace because paper and other materials can escape while burning and ignite nearby items. Never leave a fire burning unattended and make sure a fire is completely extinguished before leaving the house or going to bed. Have the chimney professionally cleaned once a year.

, Playing with matches is still the leading cause of fire-related deaths and injuries for kids younger than five years. Always keep matches and lighters out of children's reach. Store flammable materials such as gasoline, kerosene, and cleaning supplies outside of your home and away from kids.

, As decorative candles become more popular, candle fires are on the rise. If you light candles, keep them out of reach of kids and pets, away from curtains and furniture, and extinguish them before you go to bed. Make sure candles are in sturdy holders made of non-flammable material that won't tip over. Don't let your children no use candles unsupervised in their rooms.

, Around the holidays, there are even more potential fire hazards to think about. If you use a real Christmas tree in your home, make sure to water it daily and do not tie electric lights strung on a dried-out tree.


All lights and lighted window ornaments should be inspected every year to make sure that cords are not worn or frayed, and all candles should be used with care. The number of fires started by candles nearly doubles during the month of December.

, Having a smoke alarm in the house cuts your risk of dying in a fire in half. Almost 60% of all fatal residential fires occur in homes that don't have smoke alarms, so this may be the single most important thing you can do to keep your family safe from fires.


If your home doesn't have smoke alarms, now is the time to install them on every level of your home and in each bedroom. If possible, choose one with a 10-year lithium battery. If your smoke alarm uses regular batteries, remember to replace them every year (hint: change your batteries when you change your clock back from Daylight Saving Time in the fall). Test your smoke alarms monthly, and be sure your kids are familiar with the sound of the alarm.
Because smoke rises, smoke detectors should always be placed on ceilings or high on walls. If a smoke detector near the kitchen goes off while you're cooking, do not take the battery out of it—you may forget to replace it. Open the doors and windows instead. Or you might consider installing a rate-of-rise heat detector for places like the kitchen, where smoke or steam from cooking are likely to cause false alarms. These alarms can sense when the temperature reaches a set critical point or when it rises by more than a certain number of degrees a minute.
If you're having a new home built or remodeling an older home, you may want to consider adding a home sprinkler system. These are already found in many apartment buildings and dormitories. Carbon monoxide alarms also can be lifesaving.

, Be prepared for any accidents by having fire extinguishers strategically placed around your house—at least one on each floor and in the kitchen (this one should be an all-purpose extinguisher, meaning it can be used on grease and electrical fires), the basement, the garage, or workshop area. Keep them out of reach of children. Fire extinguishers are best used when a fire is contained in a small area, like a wastebasket, and when the fire department has already been called. The best time to learn how to use the fire extinguisher is now, before you ever need it (if you have any questions, the local fire department can help). Fire extinguishers have gauges on them indicating when they need to be replaced and should be checked regularly to make sure they're still functional. If you're ever in doubt about whether to use an extinguisher on a fire, don't try it. Instead, leave the house immediately and call the fire department. The NFPA says to remember the acronym PASS when operating an extinguisher:


Pull the pin. Release the lock with the nozzle pointing away from you.
Aim low. Point the extinguisher at the base of the fire.
Squeeze the lever slowly and evenly.
Sweep the nozzle from side to side.

, A smoke alarm can alert you and give you time to escape. Alarms can be wired to mains with battery back up or battery only. Wired alarms are more reliable in the long term.

, The two main types for home is photoelectric and ionization. Both alarms are very effective, but photoelectric are more effective for detecting smouldering fires. Many homes have the ionisation type installed, however fire fighters recommend that photoelectric type should be installed in bedrooms and adjacent hallways.

, The location of a smoke alarm is very important. It is necessary to have a smoke alarm in each bedroom as you are most vulnerable in bed. If you or family members sleep with the door closed connect the alarm with others in the house. Interconnecting smoke alarms are especially important when there is more than one story or if the bedrooms are located in different parts of the house.


Smoke alarm manufacturers recommend replacing smoke alarms every ten years.
If your house has more than one-storey place one on each level and at the bottom of each stair well.
Avoid placing a smoke alarm near air-conditioning or heating. The air flow coming out of the unit may blow the smoke away and fail to alert you.

, Smoke alarms should be installed on the ceiling, but if this is not possible you may install it on the wall. In this case fit it between 6 in. (150 mm) and 12 in. (300 mm) below the ceiling line. Check with the manufacturers instructions if it is suitable for wall mounting.

, When fitting the smoke alarm near a corner location on the wall, avoid placing it in dead space. The corner can create dead space because it traps hot air and stops it from reaching the smoke alarm. In this case fit the smoke alarm between 12 in. (300 mm) and 20 in. (500 mm) below the ceiling line. For a cathedral ceiling make sure the smoke detector is between 20 in. (500 mm) and 60 in. (1500 mm) from the apex. Check the manufacturers instructions to make sure it is suitable for wall mounting.

, Here are some things you should do:


Test the alarm weekly.
Clean the smoke alarm and ceiling around it with a vacuum cleaner each month.
Change the battery at least once a year with the battery specified by the alarm manufacturer.

, A fire blanket is very effective for smothering flames. You can use a fire blanket to cover a pan of burning cooking oil or burning clothes on a child. Fire blanket contains display instructions for their use.

, A fire blanket can be used to smother a cooking oil fire. Ensure the blanket does not contact the burning oil and that the stove is off. Never use water to put out oil fires.

, A fire blanket should only be used once. When you buy a new one ensure it meets the appropriate country standards.

, Fire blankets should be placed where they can be easily reached in an emergency. Place it near the normally used path to exit the kitchen.

, If you live in a two-storey house find a way to escape from the second level.

, You should have a designated meeting place at the front of the house where everyone should meet. Most people use their mail box as their meeting place.

, Give special considerations to elderly or disabled people.

, You could put it on the fridge or notice board. Practice the escape plan at least twice a year.

, When at home keep a key inside the deadlock so you can leave quickly. Remember you may have less than two minutes to leave.

, Planned escape routes are a necessity, especially if a fire were to occur during the night. Go through each room in your house and think about the possible exits. You should have in your mind two escape routes from each room, in case one is blocked by fire. Inspect the room to make sure that furniture and other objects are not blocking doorways or window.

,


When there is smoke, crawl low and get under the smoke.
Alert others as you go.
When there is smoke crawl low to get under the smoke.
Test each door with the back of your hand.
Close the door as you go through it to prevent fire and smoke from spreading.
Never go back inside the house, once out you stay out.
Meet at the assembly area such as the letterbox.
Make sure your family know how to call the fire service.

, Fires are frightening and can cause panic. By rehearsing different scenarios, your family will be less likely to waste precious time trying to figure out what to do.

, Remember these may be your only way out in a fire.

, Be sure to know the locations of the closest stairwells or fire escapes and where they lead.

, You should have one escape ladder made of fire-safe material (aluminum, not rope) in each upper-story bedroom that is occupied by a person who is capable of using it.

, The ladder must be approved by an independent testing laboratory, its length must be appropriate for your home, and it must support the weight of the heaviest adult in the house.

, Designate a meeting place outside your house or apartment building that is a safe distance away (a mailbox, a fence, or even a distinctive-looking tree will do) where everyone can be accounted for after they escape.

, Use your finger to set off the smoke detector and let everyone know it's time for a fire drill. See if everyone can evacuate your home and gather outside within 3 minutes which is the time it can take for an entire house to go up in flames.

,, There are many types available. Each type may be rated for one or more classes of fire. Some fires can be extremely dangerous to use on certain classes of fire and can increase the fire threatening your safety.

,


Class A: Wood, paper, plastics, etc.
Class B: Flammable liquids.
Class C: Flammable gasses.
Class D: Metal fires.
Class E: Energized electrical equipment.
Class F: Cooking oils and fats.

,


Water (Colored red): Dangerous if used on flammable liquid, energized electrical equipment and cooking oil or fat fires.
Wet Chemical (Colored oatmeal or oatmeal label): Dangerous if used on energized electrical equipment.
Foam (Colored blue or blue label): Dangerous if used on energized electrical equipment.
ABE or BE Powder (White label): Specific types of powders available for metal fires.
Carbon dioxide (Black label): Generally not suitable for outdoor use. Suitable only for small fires.
Vaporizing liquid (Colored yellow or yellow label): Check the characteristics of the specific agent.

, They are Rechargeable, non-rechargeable or aerosol.


Rechargeable fire extinguisher: Designed for households in various sizes and different extinguisher mediums.
Non-rechargeable fire extinguisher: These contain a powder extinguishant.
Aerosol fire extinguisher: These are non-rechargeable and cover a wide range of fire classes. Check the manufactures recommendation for specific use.

, Check that the fire extinguisher you use complies with your countries safety standards and read the label carefully before you need to use it. Always have rechargeable fire extinguishers serviced and maintained by a qualified agent. Dispose aerosol fire extinguishers before the use by date.

, Fire extinguishers are for small fires only. Make sure you don't place yourself in danger by using one, be sure that before you attempt to put it out it is small enough to be managed by a fire extinguisher and that you aren't going to spread it.

, Before you use the extinguisher to fight, make sure you have a clear view and can approach it safely. Do not attempt to fight the fire if it is too hot or fierce. Fire can block your escape when they become out of control so ensure your back is towards an exit and you have a clear path to escape. If it is not safe run away and call the fire service.

, Never use a water extinguisher to put out cooking oil or a fat fire. A BE fire extinguisher is recommended to have in kitchens. It is best to place it in the path you use to leave the kitchen, such as the kitchen door.


When using a powder extinguisher on burning cooking oil or fat it is recommend you stand two meters away from the fire and aim over the pan. Do not aim the extinguishant directly into the pan that contains the oil or fat because it might spread the fire around the kitchen.

, Pets are generally curious and will investigate cooking appliances, candles or even a fire in your fireplace. Ensure your pet is not left unattended around an open flame and make sure to thoroughly extinguish any open flame before leaving your home.

, Ensure you remove stove knobs or protect them with covers before leaving the house. A stove or cook top is the number one piece of equipment involved in your pet starting a fire.

, These candles contain a light bulb rather than an open flame, and take the danger out of your pet knocking over a candle. Cats are notorious for starting fires when their tails turn over lit candles.

, Do not leave a glass water bowl for your pet outside on a wooden deck. When filtered through the glass and water, the sun’s rays can actually heat up and ignite the wooden deck beneath it. Choose stainless steel or ceramic bowls instead.

, Take a walk around your home and look for areas where pets might start fires inadvertently, such as loose wires and other potential hazards.

, Keep pets near entrances when away from home. When leaving pets home alone, keep them in areas or rooms near entrances where firefighters can easily find them.

, Especially with young puppies, keep them confined away from potential fire-starting hazards when you are away from home, such as in crates or behind baby gates in secure areas.

, Keep collars and leashes easily accessible in case you have to evacuate quickly with your pet or firefighters need to rescue your pet.

, As an added layer of protection beyond battery-operated smoke alarms, smoke detectors connected to a monitoring center help save pets who can’t escape when left home alone.

, Write down the number of pets inside your house and attach the static cling to a front window. This critical information saves rescuers time when locating your pets. Make sure to keep the number of pets listed on them updated.

Choose your location.,
The diffusion of carbon monoxide in air is relatively even, meaning that a source of carbon monoxide can distribute the gas evenly throughout the room and house.,
Place smoke detectors in the best places around the house.,
Install the hardware.,
Perform regular maintenance.,
Try to change the batteries at least twice a year.,
Note that carbon monoxide detectors have a chemical that helps in the detection process.,
Rest a little easier.",How to Install a Smoke Detector or Carbon Monoxide Detector," It is recommended by firefighters that you mount smoke detectors high on the wall, or on the ceiling away from windows and exterior doors. (This is not the case for carbon monoxide alarms, about which, see #2, below.) Smoke fills up a room from the ceiling down, so having the detectors high should alert you early on. It is also recommended that detectors be placed at least 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4"" from the wall when installed on the ceiling, and 10 centimeter (3.9 in) / 4"" from the ceiling for wall installation.;
, When installing a carbon monoxide alarm, choose a location where the alarm will stay clean, and out of the way of children or pets.

, It is important to install detectors near sleeping areas and on every level of your home. Also place a detector in hallways and a carbon monoxide detector near heating, such as gas furnaces. Avoid installing a smoke detector in the kitchen. Unless, of course, you want everyone to notice your lack of culinary skills! Also keep detectors one meter / 3.3 feet (1.0 m) from the doorways of steam emitting areas, such as the bathroom, laundry or kitchen.

,

Measure the distance between the mounting holes on the back of the mounting bracket.






Mark the same distance on your chosen location.






Drill small holes at the marks.






Attach the mounting bracket to the surface with the screws. See ""Tips"" for seeking professional assistance.






Mount the rest of the detector into the bracket.







,


Routinely test your detectors. Push the test button to elicit a loud noise. If there is no noise, or a faint noise, you should check or change the batteries. For smoke detectors, you can also test the detector using simulated smoke. See How to Test a Smoke Detector.

, A good way to remember is: Every time you change the clocks, change the batteries. Always test the unit after a battery change, to confirm that the batteries are properly installed and working.

, This needs to be replenished over time, so be sure to check this as well as the batteries.

, It's simple but it's an important step to take to help protect your loved ones and your home. To provide additional certainty on top of the detector, take a moment to develop a safety escape plan. Make sure that all the members of the family know this plan, know how they can escape and where they can all reassemble again once outside the house. Include special needs such as infants and the elderly when developing your plan.

Identifying fire hazards.,
Identify individuals at risk.,
Evaluation and Action.,
Record, Plan and Train.,
Revision.",How to Perform a Fire Risk Assessment in Your Workplace," The initial step of your fire risk assessment is to assess your premises for fire hazards. This includes looking for sources of ignition that could start a fire, flammable materials or chemicals that can cause fires. Another important factor to look for is source of oxygen, fires need oxygen to start and any dangerous material that have a large source of oxygen can be a big cause for starting fires.;
, Once you feel you have identified all possible fire hazards you must then look at the people who are at risk from these hazards. This will include everyone from employees, customers, visitors and any individuals that need extra attention such as children or elderly.

, Now that you have assessed your workplace for fire hazards and looked at who could be in danger, you must now evaluate all this and start to remove the risks. You must evaluate the dangers and remove them completely or add precautions that will prevent a fire. This can include lighting, signs, fire fighting equipment, detection and warning but always considering the security of individuals.

, You must record everything that has been done during this assessment, such as, fire hazards found, how they were removed, any precautions implemented. Once this steps have been taken you must create a manageable plan of how to monitor any precautions and what must be done to maintain a safe, fire free environment. This includes creating an evacuation plan, fires cannot always be prevented so you must have an escape route in place so everyone can evacuate safely. You must inform all relevant individuals of what was done during the assessment and teach them the evacuation route. If you have a particularly large premises, fire training may be beneficial for your staff so people can manage an evacuation safely and in the correct way.

, Once all above has been completed and you have a constructed fire safety plan, you must review it on a regular basis to ensure it is up to date and reflects any changes to your workplace.

Ask when it is safe to enter a house or other building on the property after a fire.,
Recognize that if a house or building is too badly damaged, you may not be allowed back inside at all.

,
Know who to call after a fire.,
Understand what happens with a ""fire report"".,
Know how to get a copy of a fire report.,
Secure the property.,
Consider the clean up requirements.,
Know how to handle smoke and soot damage after a fire.,
If water hoses were used to put out your fire drying your home is very important.,
Seek counseling if needed and reassure children.",How to Know What to Do Following a House Fire," Do not enter a house or other building that has been affected by a fire until you have listened to the professionals telling you that is okay to do so. Other factors to be aware of include:


making sure that the fire is extinguished
knowing that fire authorities have checked out the site and done what they need to do to establish a safety zone
the severity of the fire;
,,


Contact family members that may not have been with you. Let them know what happened, let them know that everybody is okay (if so) and let them know the information that is necessary.
After a house fire, don't assume that someone is going to contact your insurance. This is the number one thing that you need to do. This will not only enable documentation of the event and set in train the insurance claim but your insurer will be able to talk you through emergency lodging and living expenses. Remember to retain all receipts to make a claim.The insurance company will also assist with clean up options.If you are a tenant, contact the owner/landlord and/or their insurance company.
Anyone who you feel that could be helpful to you, not necessarily just an insurance company but it could be other things involved, such as the contents of your home and you need to contact a particular help group or business etc. For example, American Red Cross offers services to those who have lost their home.

, A fire report will discuss what structure the house was in, what area was involved, the time of the incident, the date of the incident and it will have an incident number if it comes through a fire department. This enables the fire department to know all the specifics of who was there and what resources were there, to assist in gathering a lot more information.

, You may be able to call the fire department for a copy. For example, in Los Angeles, you can call the Fire Prevention Bureau, the Fire Marshall or the billing agency of the fire department. If arson is involved, the Arson Unit or equivalent will probably be able to get this information to you.

, If you have not already being told to do so, it is important to secure your property to prevent possible looting. Talk to emergency services on how best to go about this. Most insurance policies require this., If your house has been damaged rather than destroyed, interior clean up will be required. Keep in mind that damage to the property often goes beyond what the eye can see. (Removal of a destroyed house should only be done by professionals.) You should spend a little time assessing whether you think you can perform the clean up or if you'll need professional cleaners. You will find it useful to discuss this with your insurance company. Consider such things as:


The types of damage including soot, ash, charring, smoke, odor, etc.
Damage to a single room - this may be something you can manage yourself
Extensive damage - leave it alone and call in the professionals, If you do make the decision to clean up yourself, be aware that soot and smoke damage might be significant and often creates a film on the walls. There will also be residue from the extinguishers used by the fire crew.



Soot - while there are many cleaning products available on the market, one of the most common is ""TSP"" or tri-sodium phosphate. Mix it with water according to the instructions and use a sponge. Wipe down the walls and let it dry.

Extinguisher residue - use a shop hired vacuum to remove the residue and any remaining dry soot.Furnishings such as carpets, rugs, curtains etc. are best cleaned professionally if they are even salvageable.Open all doors and windows if possible. Even if it is freezing cold outside, let small bursts of fresh air circulate through. Send the kids to a friend's house for a bit while this is happening. They should not be around anyway, for fear of the potential for ingestion of chemical particles or other particles that might damage young lungs and immune systems.

, It is best to hire professionals to do fire/ water combination clean up. Water damage can lead to more damage or even mold if not dried properly. Insurance companies will often have approved restoration contractors that you can call for board up, structural drying, contents cleaning and structural cleaning and repair. BBB and Angie's List are also good places to find trustworthy contractors.

, Having your house damaged or destroyed by fire is extremely traumatic and can have lasting impacts on each family member, depending on his or her ability to cope. Common feelings are helplessness, disorientation, pining for belongings, deep sadness, a sense of deprivation, despair and a loss of routine and structure.The depth of feelings and disorientation will depend on the extent of damage - loss of the entire house can leave everyone feeling as if they have to rebuild life all over again; partial loss, however, still carried stress and sadness. Reassure each other and let the emotions happen. Keep a close eye on children and be truthful with them about what has happened and if you do not know what is going to happen next, at least reassure them that you have one another, that things can all be replaced and that the only way is up from here on.

Teach kids about when to use 9-1-1.,
Learn about what information to include to a dispatcher.,
Familiarize yourself with numbers to call in non-emergency circumstances.,
Get a fake phone.,
Role play some scenarios.,
Practice stating your name and address.",How to Practice Dialing 9 1 1," If you want to teach your kids about 9-1-1, you need to explain its uses first. Sit down with your kids and talk to them about what 9-1-1 is and when it's appropriate to call.


Make sure to say ""nine-one-one"" when explaining instead of something like ""nine-eleven."" The latter could confuse kids as there's no eleven number on a phone's keyboard.Tell kids what constitutes an emergency. An emergency is when someone is hurt or in danger or when there is a fire or accident that requires medical assistance. Make sure kids know not to call 9-1-1 when bored, if a pet or toy is lost, or as a joke. Make it very clear that calling 9-1-1 as a joke could land them in trouble.;
, Once you've explained the circumstances where dialing 9-1-1 is important, talk about what information to include when speaking to a dispatcher. Make sure your kids know what information to include when calling.


Make sure kids know their addresses. Young children especially might not have their address memorized. Take some time to practice memorizing addresses before explaining everything else to include.Explain to kids they need to discuss the nature of the emergency. Tell them to briefly include what's happening, whether anyone is injured, and how severe the injuries are., You may sometimes need to call and report problems that are not emergencies but required professional assistance. For example, a heat outage or power outage might need reporting. You might also need to report suspicious but non emergency activity, like strange noises coming from an apartment. Usually, such situations can be reported to local branches of your fire department or police department. Make sure you have these numbers on hand.

, In order to practice dialing 9-1-1, have a fake phone. Children will respond best to realistic scenarios, so get a toy cell phone or landline telephone that is not plugged in. Set it up in an area with few distractions so you can practice calling 9-1-1.

, Have your kids pretend to dial 9-1-1 while you act as dispatcher. Go through a variety of scenarios where it might be necessary to dial 9-1-1.


You can start off by having your kids read off printed scripts. You can find 9-1-1 tutorials for kids online that have scripts where someone has to act as the caller and someone acts as the dispatcher.You can also print out pictures of emergencies and have kids call based on what they see in the pictures. This can help kids know how to speak to a 9-11 dispatcher on their own.As the dispatcher, always start of by saying ""This is 9-1-1. What's your emergency?"" Make sure to press yours kids for details. If they say ""My friend is hurt"" ask things like ""Is he conscious? Is there any blood? How did he get hurt?"", Adults can get nervous about dialing 9-1-1 as well. During emergencies, people sometimes fumble over details. If this is the case with you, it's a good idea to prepare. Practice stating your name and address a few times a day. In the event of an emergency, you'll be able to more calmly convey that information.

Know that fire service mode can be activated automatically (whenever smoke is detected within the building) or manually (using a key switch located on the ground floor).,
Understand that when fire service mode is activated, each elevator will automatically return to the ground floor.,
At this point, the elevators will remain inoperable.,
You may now select a floor (or group of floors) to go to.,
The elevator will not leave the floor until the ""Door Close"" button is held down.,
The elevator will travel to the desired floor.,
If you wish to leave the elevator, set the fire service key switch to ""Hold"" and remove the key.,
To return to the recall floor, set the fire service key switch to ""Off"".

,
The elevators will continue to remain inoperable.",How to Operate an Elevator in Fire Service Mode,";
, If smoke has been detected on the ground floor, the elevators will return to an alternate floor. Once the elevators have arrived at the recall floor, the doors will open.

, In order to use them, you must set the fire service key switch (located in each elevator) to one of the following positions:


On: Permits usage of the elevator in fire service mode
Bypass: Returns the elevator to normal operation

, Pressing the ""Call Cancel"" button will clear your selection(s).

, You must hold this button until the doors are fully closed; otherwise, they will reopen.

, When it stops, the doors will remain closed. This is a safety feature. You must hold the ""Door Open"" button until the doors are fully open. If smoke or flames enter the elevator, release the button immediately. The doors will close.

, This prevents others from using the elevator. To continue using fire service mode, reinsert the key and turn it to ""On"".

,, To return them to normal operation, turn the fire recall switch (located in the hallway) to ""Reset"".




It should be noted that each elevator manufacturer uses their own fire service key. That's why you often see a Knox- box for firefighters to obtain the proper key for a building's specific model elevator. For example, a Dover (Thyssen-Krupp) elevator uses a different key than an Otis.

Get in touch.If the fire victim is someone you know and care about, get in touch with them as soon as you can.,
Offer financial support.,
Bring a meal.,
Replace lost belongings.,
Run an errand.,
Stick with them through the process.,
Know what to donate.,
Contact the Red Cross.,
Find local donation drop-off points.,
Donate food and supplies to local animal shelters.,
Encourage friends and neighbors to help.,
Establish a local donation center.,
Connect with the local media.",How to Help Fire Victims," Simply reaching out in love to a fire victim can provide a healing dose of emotional support.


By its very nature, house fires and similar crises can make people feel isolated and alone. Making contact lets your loved ones know that they are not as alone as they might feel.
You can call, text, or e-mail the victim. Any method of communication is better than none at all.
Keep your words simple. Saying ""I'm sorry for your loss"" and ""I'm glad you're alive"" is usually enough. Platitudes regarding the ""bright side"" of things don't often help, especially not during the initial stages of shock.
If you offer your support, make sure that you plan to follow through and provide it. Now is not the time for false promises.
Listen more than you speak. Everyone reacts to tragedy in a different manner, so you should wait to hear from the victim about how hopeful or distraught he or she feels before chiming in.;
, Even if the homeowner had insurance, the amount of red tape and paperwork he or she will need to sort through will delay the claim. A financial gift will almost always help, even if you can only afford to give a small amount.


If you can meet in person, consider handing the victim cash or a check. When you want to offer financial support but must do so via mail, send a check since cash is less secure.
Another option would be to give the victim a gift card. Gift certificates to a grocery store are practical and make a great choice, but you can also do something a little more personalized if you know the victim relatively well. For instance, a gift card to a bookstore can be a good choice for a family of avid readers since it gives them a chance to restock their lost book collection.

, During the initial chaos and trauma, simple tasks like cooking dinner can seem a lot more complicated than usual. Cooking a meal and bringing it to your neighbor or loved one offers both practical and emotional support.


If you can't cook, you could bring your loved ones groceries or offer to take them out to a restaurant.
Sending food can even be helpful if the victims are staying with someone since this gesture can relieve some of the burden from their hosts.

, Find out how much was lost and donate items to help replace some of those belongings.


It is generally a wise idea to find out what the victim needs instead of making assumptions. Insurance often provides fire victims with household basics, for instance. Even if their basic supplies won't be replaced by insurance, fire victims may not need such items until after they've found a place to stay.
Items of sentimental value can never be replaced, but there might be ways for you to help dull the loss. For instance, if the victim is a close relative, you can provide them copies of photographs they lost in the fire.
Kids can be especially devastated when personal possessions are lost in a fire. Find out if there were any lost toys or games that meant a lot and ask if you can buy a replacement.

, If you live nearby, offer to run an errand for the fire victim. Doing so can save them time and energy that they will undoubtedly need for something else.


Ask the victims if there are any errands they haven't been able to do yet, like shopping for certain items. Offer to take care of these errands for them.
If the errand is something that the victim must be present for, like something dealing with the bank or insurance company, offer to drive him or her there if transportation would otherwise be a problem.

, Commit to helping your neighbor or loved ones throughout the entire recovery process. When the initial flood of support passes by, they will appreciate that you've still remained by their side.


As the process continues, the victims' needs may change. Someone who wasn't ready to replace household goods at first might need to do so three months later, for instance. Make it a point to keep asking the victims what they need and helping them out accordingly.
If nothing else, continued emotional support can mean a lot to a fire victim.

, Fire victims are usually in need of both money and supplies, so donating either one can help a lot.


Make sure that the donation you plan to make is accepted by the donation facility you plan to leave it with.
When donating supplies, focus on things the fire victims will need immediately instead of things that will be needed later on. Some good options include clothes, canned food, bottled water, pain relievers, baby food, trash bags, laundry detergent, socks, pillows, blankets, and diapers., Your local chapter of the Red Cross may step in, especially when widespread loss is involved. Getting in touch with the Red Cross online, by phone, or in person is one of the quickest ways to find out how you can help.


You can find the contact information for your local Red Cross location by using the online search tool: http://www.redcross.org/find-your-local-chapter

You can also contact the Red Cross by phone at 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767).When widespread fire damage is an issue, the Red Cross will need both donations and volunteers. If you cannot donate money or supplies, donating your time is another option worth considering.

, Depending on the circumstances, various businesses, churches, and government offices in your area might be accepting donations for the fire victims. You can donate money and supplies to fire victims you don't know through these donation drop-off points.


If you do not know where to look, call your city hall, local news station, or local radio station. These sources of information might be able to direct you to a place accepting donations.
Churches are common donation drop-off points, as are radio stations and news stations.
Your Public Utility District (PUD) or city hall might be accepting donations, too.
Businesses often establish themselves as donation drop-off points, too, especially when widespread fire damage is an issue. These businesses can vary in nature and may include banks, credit unions, restaurants, and home improvement stores., When house fires sweep through a broad area and cause widespread loss, many pets get lost and picked up by local animal shelters. Donate to the local shelter to help them handle the influx of pet.


By assisting the animal shelter, you allow them to save and support more pets for a longer period. This gives their owners a greater chance to find them again.
Aside from dog food and cat food, you should also consider donating crates, cat litter, toys, towels, and beds.

, Regardless of whether the fire was widespread or confined to a single family, encouraging your friends, relatives, and neighbors to assist in helping the victims can have a significant impact.


Let these individuals know what they can do to help fire victims in the area. Share the advice you've learned here and elsewhere. Some who are willing to help may not do so if they do not know where to start or what to do.

, Talk to a local church or another business that might be willing to establish itself as a drop-off point for donations.


Make sure that the place you choose is trustworthy. Churches and community centers are usually good places to start. If you would prefer to work with a local business, make sure that the one you choose has a good and honest reputation.
Some organizations may even be willing to help you set up a fundraiser to help the victims. If they do not want to be involved in the planning process, they may at least allow you to use their premises.

, Spread the word about the disaster by contacting local television news stations, local radio stations, and local newspapers. Doing so can spread news of the fire to a wider audience, and a wider audience may mean a larger base of support.


When the damage is confined to one family or a small group of families, you may want to get the victims' permission before spreading their story. Some people won't mind being put in the spotlight, but others may prefer their privacy.

Learn about the three fundamental needs for a fire.,
Take a course in fire science.,
Study the weather.",How to Fight a Forest Fire1," These are heat, fuel and oxygen, and understanding the role that they play in forest fires will give you a good start to your fire management endeavors.


A fire has to be started by a heat source. It can be a natural source, like lightning, or a human-generated source, such as campfires, sparks or cigarette butts.
The fuel for a forest fire is generally dry grass, leaves, moss, shrubs and/or pine tree needles. These fine sources of fuel burn quickly and require less energy to burn than larger sources like full, live trees.
Sufficient oxygen must be present to sustain a fire, so when winds come through, they not only spread the fire to other fuel sources but also bring in fresh oxygen to keep the fire going.;
, Though you must be brave and courageous to fight a fire, you also must know the science behind what's going on to successfully fight it. Knowing how fire behaves and the meteorology and geography of the area will make containing the fire easier.


Contact your local colleges, universities, local fire departments and national parks. The firefighters in your city or staff at a local wildlife area may offer tutorials on firefighting and prevention.

, How intense a fire gets and how fast it can spread is directly related to wind speed, temperature and relative humidity. Other, severe conditions (like drought) can also play a role in the strength and number of wildfires in an area. Accurate and timely weather information is vital to the planning and execution of strategies for suppressing wildfires.


In the US alone, there are many different versions of the scales measuring fire potential. The ERC scale (Energy Release Component) relates fuel energy potential to an area, the Burning Index measures flame length against fire speed and temperature, the Haines index relies on stability and air humidity, and the Keeth-Byrun Drought Index works in the abstract, taking in a fuel's likelihood to burn and at what percentage."

Check your household smoke alarms once a month.,
Stay in the kitchen when using the stove, and turn everything off when you are done.,
Never put toasters or other hot items underneath a kitchen cupboard.,
Practice safety with heat and electricity in the bathroom.,
Be very careful when burning candles in the home.,
Keep flammable objects ""3 feet from the heat"" (1 meter).,
Stay safe with electrical wires and outlets.,
Don't smoke in the house.,
Turn off lights and heat sources when you are done.,
Talk to children about fire safety.",How to Guard Yourself Against Fire in Your Home," Smoke detectors reduce your risk of being killed in fire by 50%.If the battery is low, replace it.


Change the batteries every year.
Replace your smoke alarms every 10 years.;
, Don't leave the kitchen if you are frying, grilling, using the stove, or using an open flame. Too many people go out and mistakenly leave food cooking on the stove and it boils dry and causes a fire. A moment's thought can and does save lives.


If you need to leave the kitchen briefly, turn off the stove (no matter how soon you'll be back).
Tie back long hair. Wear short, tight, or tightly-rolled-up sleeves when cooking.
Make sure you turn off the stove, oven, etc. when you are done., It may cause a fire.

, Turn off any heat-styling equipment (hair curlers, blow-dryers) once you're done, and place them where they aren't touching anything flammable.

, Candles may fall over a TV switch, washing machine, or dryer, and start a fire. If you have a candle burning, keep it in sight.


Run the spent match under cold water from the faucet before you throw it in the trash.
Place the candle in a glass jar or on a glass dish. Some candles get very hot from prolonged use, and may burn plastic containers. (This also protects your fingers if you pick up a hot candle.)

,

If you are using a fireplace, space heater, baseboard, etc. it's important to keep away objects that could catch fire. Be mindful of things such as...

Furniture
Curtains
Dish towels
Papers

, Avoid using too many extension cords, or too much electricity from one outlet.


If a light switch is hot to the touch, or if a light flickers, it needs to be professionally replaced.

, If you need to smoke, do so outside or in a garage or basement, at least 3 feet (1 meter) away from flammable items. Put out the butt in a can of sand, then place it in an ashtray. Soak the butts and ashes in water before throwing them away.Make a habit of properly disposing of the butt. One careless disposal could cost you lots of money, your home, or your life.

Never smoke in an armchair or in bed; doing so could lead to fire.

, Avoid leaving lights, lamps, or electric blankets on for long periods.

, Explain to children that matches and some appliances (stove, oven, hair dryer) are dangerous, so they must not play with them. Explain that they need a responsible adult when using these things, for their and the family's safety.


For young children, keep matches and hot appliances out of reach.
Tell children that if they find a match or lighter, they should not touch it. The best thing to do is let it be, and go tell an adult right away.
Never leave children unattended near stoves, candles, space heaters, etc. (even for a short time)"

Fight fire with fire by creating a fireline.,
Use water as a fire suppression tool.,
Consider suppressant foam.,
Take advantage of natural barriers to help you fight fires.",How to Fight a Forest Fire2," This is the objective of most agencies as it contains the fire immediately, preventing spreading and future damage.


Sometimes the easiest and fastest way to fight a fire is to do a controlled burn around the perimeter of a forest fire. A controlled burn will allow you to cut off the fuel source of the larger fire by already burning off the dry plants, thus stopping the spread of the fire.

Take note: embers fly. Even if you do have a fireline constructed, the wind may carry smoldering embers that can move the fire and exacerbate the problem.


In this situation, you are removing the fuel component of the fire, and this method is considered an indirect attack on the fire.

, Nature's way is still the best way and it probably always will be. It removes the fuel source by making it too moist and can suppress oxygen to the flames.


When fire crews arrive at a forest fire, they set up power pumps at the closest water source that they can find and then they run their hoses to the fire. Or it may be brought in via tanker or helibucket.
If you are by yourself or with your family and not with a professional fire fighting team, make every effort to control a fire with water available so as not to spread the flames and create a larger fire. However, if if the fire grows even the slightest bit, call the fire department and evacuate immediately.
A fireline can also be created with water, soaking up the perimeter of the fire, preventing future spreading.

, if you are part of a fire management agency in your area or can get a hold of one, consider this alternative to water, which may be in short supply.


Whether you use an aerial or a ground application, suppressant foam can help you extinguish your fires faster by acting as an insulated barrier to keep unburned fuels from being ignited.
The bubble structure of the foam also gives you a slower, more controlled water drainage, which helps you penetrate better and longer into the fuel sources.

, Areas like rivers, lakes, roads, swamps and rocky areas can be a natural ending spot for a fire so that you can concentrate on tackling other sides.


All fire suppression activities are based from an anchor point, often one of these spots. The likelihood of the fire reaching this area is less than average, providing a place firefighters can stay for an extended period of time.

Note the warnings in your area.,
Don't light grass fires or burn debris.,
Exercise campfire safety.,
Perform regular equipment maintenance.",How to Fight a Forest Fire3," The National Weather Service has great technology that detects when fires are likely to occur and if they've already started, how they'll behave. If you're out camping, take note of any warnings issued or fire forecasts for your area.



Red Flag Warning: This is issued when existing environmental conditions (aridity, etc.) combined with expected weather conditions could result in fires starting within the next 24 hours.

Fire Weather Watch: This is issued when Red Flag conditions are expected to arise within the next 3 days.
National Fire Danger Rating Forecasts are point forecasts issued for selected observation sites. These forecasts are used as input for the National Fire Danger Rating System which generates indexes which are used in determining fire danger for a given area and to plan for the necessary human and other resources needed to fight wildfires.

, Contact your local fire department in advance to confirm that burning is allowed and to find out whether a permit is required to burn debris.If it is, follow these standard guidelines:


Check the weather forecast. If it is particularly windy in your area, it may not be advisable to start any type of fire.
Prepare the site correctly. The ground around the burn site should be surrounded by gravel or mineral soil (dirt) for at least ten feet in all directions. Keep the surrounding area watered down during the burn.Remain with your fire. Stay with it until it is completely out. To ensure the fire has been completely extinguished, drown the fire with water, turn over the ashes with a shovel and drown it again. Repeat several times., Having a bonfire can be an absolute blast, but if done unsafely, can result in serious damage. Make sure to exercise logic and caution when having a campfire.


Do not build a fire at a site in hazardous, dry conditions. Do not build a fire if the campground, area, or event rules prohibit campfires. If there is not an existing fire pit, and pits are allowed, look for a site that is at least fifteen feet away from tent walls, shrubs, trees or other flammable objects. Also beware of low-hanging branches overhead.Clear a 10-foot diameter area that's downwind around the site. Remove any grass, twigs, leaves and firewood. Also make sure there aren't any tree limbs or flammable objects hanging overhead. Circle the pit with rocks.If you do not have water, use dirt. Mix enough dirt or sand with the embers. Continue adding and stirring until all material is cool. Remember: do NOT bury the fire as the fire will continue to smolder and could catch roots on fire that will eventually get to the surface and start a wildfire.

Remember: If it's too hot to touch, it's too hot to leave!, Today, most mechanical devices come with built-in safety tools. Spark arrestors are used to destroy exhaust particles released from combustion engines before they can wreak any havoc. However, if they're not working properly, using the machine could be dangerous, releasing sparks into a dry, grassy area, starting a fire inadvertently.Multiple position small engine (MSE) arrestors are used for handheld equipment like saws and blowers. General purpose (GP) arrestors are used for immobile engines -- tractors, motorcycles, etc."

Figure out which way it swings.,
Examine the door and frame materials.,
Figure out which part of the door is weakest.",How to Kick Down a Door1," If the door swings inward, toward the inside of the building, you're in luck; you might be able to kick it in. If it swings outward, however, don't waste your time; you won't be able to kick it in, and you could break your foot if you try.Most doors on residential homes or apartments open inward. You find outward-opening doors on commercial buildings.
If you determine that the door opens outward, removing the door hinges might be an easier way to get in. However, many commercial door hinges have theft proof hinge pins that do not allow them to be removed.;
, Some doors are made cheaply, while others are built to last. Take a look at what the door and its frame are made from; the building material will determine the level of force required to kick it in.


Hollow core doors, made of hollow wood or another material that isn't solid, are usually found inside homes between rooms. These doors usually have no insulation or security, and they require minimal force to kick in.
Solid core doors are made from chipped or shaved wood with frames that have laminate on each side. They require a bit more force than hollow core doors.
Solid wood doors are made of hardwood and require an average amount of force to kick in.
Metal clad doors are made from softwood with a thin metal covering and require an average to above average amount of force.
Hollow metal doors are much heavier than other doors, have reinforcing channel around the edges and the lock mounting area, and some have insulating material. They require maximum force; it may not be possible to kick these in.

, Every door has a weak spot, depending on how it's made. Examine the door to figure out which part is made from the weakest materials. A swift kick will break the weakest part of the door which is usually the frame, the latch, or the lock.


Is it the frame? If the frame is made from lightweight wood, that may be the weakest part. Even if the lock is heavy duty, you should be able to kick in a door with a weak frame.
Is it the latch or lock? Heavier doors are weakest at the latch, the part of the door that clicks into the frame. They may also be weak just below or above the lock.

Make a diagram of your surveillance needs.,
Buy the right package to suit your needs.,
Alternatively, buy your cameras individually.,
Set up a recording device and monitor.,
Test your equipment before installing.",How to Install a Security Camera System for a House1," It is both expensive and inefficient to monitor every square inch of your house, so you need to prioritize what areas you want to watch the most. Draw up a rough diagram of your house or print out the blueprints and note where you might want to place cameras. When you are done, check out each location to make sure it is not blocked by anything and provides the best view possible. You may want cameras for:


Front and back doors.
Off-Street Windows
Large common spaces (kitchen, living room etc.)
Driveways
Porches
Stairways;
, You can buy each piece individually, but it is generally cheaper and easier to buy bundled security systems. At a minimum your system should have 1-3 cameras, a DVR (digital video recorder), appropriate wiring (siamese and BNC cables), and power cords. Unless you are choosing to monitor a large area, wireless cameras with wall mounting should cover your needs.



Basic Home Security: Get a package with 2-3 outdoor cameras (to monitor doors), and a DVR with at least 3 days of recording time.

Monitoring Valuables/Young Children: 1-3 indoor wireless cameras can cover a small room effectively and stream the footage right to your computer.

, Once you know how many cameras you need, you'll need to think about what specific cameras you want. A home surveillance system can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to well over a thousand, so make sure you consider the type of cameras you need before buying -- the features below should be clearly labeled on the box. While you can buy all of the parts separately, buying a full ""surveillance set"" is usually cheaper and easier to install.



Wireless vs. Wired: Wireless cameras are easy to set-up without drilling or running cables through your house, but the quality can be sub-par the further they get away from the receiver. If you are covering a big area, go wired, but most houses find wireless and easier set-up process.

Indoor or Outdoor: Cameras that are not made to be placed outside will quickly break when exposed to rain and humidity, so be sure to choose accordingly.

Motion Sensing: Some cameras will only record when they notice motion, saving lots of space and energy while only capturing footage when someone is in the room.

Remote Viewing: Many high-end cameras offer the ability to stream their footage to your phone or laptop anywhere in the world, making it possible to check out your house through a provided program or app., In order to store and view your footage, you need a Digital Video Recorder (DVR). This device receives all of the video feeds and broadcasts them onto a monitor, usually a computer screen or small TV. DVRs have a variety of memory capacities that allow them to store a certain amount of video, from hundreds of hours to one day's worth of footage.


If you buy a complete surveillance set the DVR is usually included with the camera.
Network Video Recorders (NVR) and analog recorders (VCRs), also available for purchase, work the same way as a DVR, using an internet signal (NVR) or blank tapes (VCR) to record instead of a digital hard-drive. The following installation tips will work here as well.

, Make sure your cables, DVR, cameras, and monitor all work by connecting each one before you install anything."

Try every possible sequence of the numbers you located.,
Try combinations using adjacent numbers if the safe won't open.,
Try again from the beginning.",How to Crack a Safe," The face of a combination lock is a circular, rotatable dial. Numbers are written around the circumference, usually beginning with 0 at the top and increasing as you go around the dial clockwise. Aside from physically breaking into the safe (which is very hard to do), correctly inputting a series of numbers into the combination dial is the only way to open a safe.;
, This is a small, simple cylinder attached to the combination dial. When you rotate the dial, the spindle rotates as well.


The spindle and other parts are not visible even with the safe door open.

, Located on the far end of the spindle (opposite the combination dial), this circular object is threaded onto the spindle and rotates with it.A small drive pin extending from the drive cam serves to catch against the wheels (see below) and set them rotating.

, Also called tumblers, these circular objects encircle the spindle but are not attached to them. They must be caught by the drive pin in order to rotate.


A combination lock has one wheel for each number in its combination (typically 2–6). For instance, a lock with a 3-number combination (e.g. 25-7-14) has three wheels.
Knowing how many wheels there are is important for cracking the safe, but there are ways to discover this number without knowing the combination (see later parts).
Small tabs on the wheel called the wheel fly catch against the drive pin or next wheel and sets them rotating. This term is not important to remember for this guide; just know that the drive cam makes contact with the wheels to set them spinning.

, The fence is a small rod resting gently atop the wheels.(It does not prevent them from turning.) The fence is connected to a lever mechanism responsible for keeping the safe shut. As long as the fence remains in place, the safe is locked.


Older texts may refer to this as lock drop, drop-pawl, or dog(an obsolete term for any object that holds or blocks another).

, Each wheel has a notch (also called a gate) at one point along its circumference. When each wheel is rotated so the notch is at the top, the fence falls into those notches. The lever moves, and the door mechanism is unlocked.


You can see why there is one wheel for each combination number. When you dial the first number, the first wheel is rotated to a position with its notch directly below the fence. You then reverse the direction of your rotation to disengage with that wheel and turn the next to its correct position.
The drive cam also has a notch for different reasons. The intended purpose is not important to know for this guide, but remember that this notch will ""click"" every time it slips past the lever (stationary part attached to the fence).
(Extra information for the curious: once the fence falls and releases the locking mechanism, the drive cam notch catches onto the bolt physically blocking the door and pulls it out of the way.), If you already know how many numbers the combination consists of, skip directly to section entitled ""Testing the Numbers."" Otherwise, read on to learn how to ""Finding the Combination Length.""

, This will reset the lock and ensure that all wheels are disengaged.

, Believe it or not, this Hollywood trope is actually used by professional locksmiths. Placing the stethoscope in both ears and the bell end against the safe wall amplifies the sounds you're listening for.


The mechanism you're listening to is located directly behind the dial, but obviously you cannot cover up the dial since you'll need to turn it. Try moving the stethoscope between different spots adjacent to the dial as you spin the combination until you find the most audible location.
Metal safes reverberate the sounds and make them easier to hear. These are a good choice for a beginning hobbyist.

, Rotate slowly and be ready to note the dial positions.


One click will be fainter than the other, since the notch making the sound is sloped toward one side.
You're listening for the sound the drive cam notch makes when it slides under the lever arm(see Learn How a Combination Lock Functions). Each side of the notch ""clicks"" as the lever passes by.
The drive cam's contact area is the name of the area on the dial face between these two clicks.

, Turn the dial several revolutions clockwise, then listen again as you turn slowly counterclockwise.


Clicks can be faint or obscured by other sounds. Repeat the process two or three times and confirming the pattern of two nearby clicks in a consistent small region of the dial face.

, Once you've found the site of the two clicks (the contact area), move the dial to the point 180º across from it, exactly opposite the dial face.This is referred to as parking the wheels. You've placed the wheels in this location and can now count them as you ""pick them up"" by turning the dial.

, Turn slowly and pay close attention each time you pass the point you ""parked the wheels"".


Remember to listen when you pass the ""parked"" position, 180º from the original ""contact area"" you found earlier.
The first time you pass that position, you should hear a click as a wheel is engaged and begins to spin with the drive cam.
Each subsequent time, you will hear a click only if there's an additional wheel to be ""picked up"".

, Only count clicks audible in that ""parked"" region.


If you hear many clicks or clicks in the wrong position, you may have made a mistake while ""parking"". Try again from the beginning of this section and make sure you are resetting the dial completely by giving it an extra few rotations.
If you are still encountering the same problem, the safe you're using could have anti-cracking technology. You may need to call a professional locksmith.

, Once you rotate past that point and hear no additional clicks, note the number of total clicks. This is the number of wheels in the combination lock.


Each wheel corresponds with one number in the combination, so you now know how many numbers you need to enter.

, You'll need to record a lot of information in order to crack a safe. Not only are line graphs an easy way to do so, the shape of the graph will aid you in finding the data you'll need.

, Each graph's x-axis should cover a span from 0 to the highest number on the dial face, spaced out enough to clearly graph points 3 numbers apart or closer. The y-axis only needs to cover a span of about 5 numbers, but you can leave it blank for now.


Label one graph's x-axis ""starting position"" and its y-axis ""left contact point"".
Label the second graph's x-axis ""starting position"" and its y-axis ""right contact point"".

, Spin the dial several rotations clockwise to disengage the wheels, then set it at the zero position.

, You're trying to find the contact areas where the drive cam connects to a wheel (see Learn How a Combination Lock Functions).

, Make sure to note the exact number you heard each click. You'll need two separate points, usually within a few numbers of each other.

, On your ""left contact point"" graph, make a point at x=0 (the number the dial began on). The y-value is the number on the dial where you heard the first click.


Similarly, on your ""right contact point"" graph, mark a point at x=0 and a y value where you heard the second click.
You can now label your y-axes. Leave enough room to graph a spread of 5 numbers on either side of the y-value you just recorded.

, Spin the dial clockwise a few times and set it 3 numbers further clockwise of zero.


This new number is the next x-value you'll record.

, Find the new y-values of the first and second clicks when you start at this location. They should be near where you heard them last time.


When you've recorded the second location, reset the lock again and set it an additional 3 numbers counterclockwise.

, Once you've mapped the entire dial (in increments of 3) and are back at the zero position, you can stop testing.

, At certain x-axis points the difference between the left and right contact point values (y axis) will be smaller.This is easier to see if you lay the two graphs one above the other and literally find the points where the two graphs are closest together.
Each of these points corresponds with a correct number in the combination.
You should know how many numbers there are in the combination, either because you've used this safe previously or because you followed the instructions for Find the Combination Length.
If the quantity of converging points on the graph doesn't match the quantity of numbers in the combination, make a new graph and see which points are consistently narrow.

, If the y-values on the two charts are closest together when x=3, 42, and 66, write down these numbers.


If you successfully followed these steps, these numbers should be the ones used in the combination, or at least close enough to work.
Note that we do not know which sequence of these numbers is the correct one. Read on for additional testing and tips.

, If you wrote down 3, 42 and 66 at the end of Search for the Combination Numbers, test the combinations (3,42,66);(3,66,42);(42,3,66);(42,66,3);(66,42,3); and (66,3,42). One should open the safe.


Remember to attempt to pull open the safe door after each complete combination! You don't want to be absent-minded and move on to the next combination before checking for success.
Remember to reset the dial between each attempt by spinning it several times.
If your dial has more than 2 or 3 wheels, you'll probably want to write down each combination in advance and cross them out as you go.

, Most safes allow for a 1 or 2 number margin of error while dialing, which is why you only needed to test every 3rd number. It's possible your safe is more exact, especially if it is more expensive.


For example, if the digits you wrote down are 3, 42, and 66, you'll need to try every combination of + + . Don't get confused and start testing combinations like (41, 42, 65); each combination should contain exactly one number from each bracketed trio.
This is really only practical for a 3 digit combination or less (requiring a maximum of 162 attempts). For a 4-digit combination, the number balloons to a maximum of 1,944 attempts. This is still much faster than trying every possible combination, but will waste a lot of time if it turns out you made an error in your cracking attempt.

, Cracking a safe takes a lot of patience and effort! Find the Combination Length, Search for the Combination Numbers, and Test Your Results all over again.


Keep your old graph and notes handy. If your new attempt gives the same partial results (for instance, 2 of the 3 numbers are the same ones you tested before), it's much more likely those results are accurate.

Park your vehicle in a sunny area.,
Apply hot air to the dents.,
Apply dry ice to the dents.",How to Repair Hail Damage1," This is a popular technique with car enthusiasts. Heat will cause the metal to expand. As the metal expands, the small dents will pop out. Using nature’s oven will take a long time if you aren’t in a very warm place.


The longer your vehicle is exposed to warm sunlight, the more likely this technique will work.;
, If you're unable to expose your vehicle to the heat of the sun, you can use a hair dryer. Hold the hair dryer 5 to 7 inches away from the dents for two minute intervals. Carefull not to touch the dryer directly on the car.If the vehicle's paint begins to discolor, stop applying heat immediately. Use wax or a rubbing compound to restore the paint’s color.

, The drastic change in temperature should cause the dents to pop out. Dry ice can damage your skin, so wear gloves when handling dry ice. Move the ice around the dented area to rapidly cool the area.


This technique can be a great solution, but sometimes there'll still be remnants of the dents after popping. Additional repairs may be required."

Focus on the area just below the doorknob.,
Get in position.,
Lift your leg and kick.,
Assess the door's give.",How to Kick Down a Door2," This is where you will deliver the blow in order to apply maximum force. Take a breath or two, and prepare to strike.

, Stand sideways, with your dominant leg closest to the door, a couple of feet from it. You should be close enough that your foot can easily kick the door with a decent amount of force.

, With your dominant leg, side kick the area just below the doorknob quite hard. When executing this kick, your center of mass should be slightly in front of your back leg, so that your body has some momentum toward the door. When you kick, it will feel somewhat like you are ""falling into"" your target. Do not lean away from the kick, but keep your body upright as much as possible.


It is advisable to hit with the sole or heel of the foot, rather than the edge. Since you are trying to transfer total kinetic energy, rather than to damage the area directly struck by your kick, increasing the impact area in this fashion is not detrimental to the effect, and helps reduce the risk of injury to your foot.
It is also important to keep your base leg (the leg you are standing on during the kick) firmly on the ground to transfer the most energy into your kick. Think about pushing from that heel.

, If you feel the door bend inward a bit when you kick, kick it again in the exact same spot. Most doors need a few good kicks before they break. Eventually the door's frame should splinter and you'll be able to kick it loose.

"
"
Make sure you're kicking the door's weakest spot.,
Try a back kick.,
Try a front kick.,
Know when to stop kicking.",How to Kick Down a Door3," If you're reasonably sure the door can be kicked down, but you aren't feeling any give, try kicking in a different spot, or use a different kicking style.

, This method offers a lot of force and more stability. Stand with your back to the door and kick backward, like a donkey. Make sure your foot lands flat just under the doorknob.


You can place your arms on the shoulders of a buddy standing in front of you (or use a table or anything that won't move and will support your weight) for further stability while you concentrate on landing your foot in the proper location.
Take a few practice ""taps"" to help prevent breaking your foot on the doorknob.

, Front kicking a door down will not offer as much force as a side or back kick, but you can aim your foot more precisely. Stand a few feet away from the door, with your dominant foot placed in the back. Use your dominant leg to front kick the area just below the doorknob quite hard (with a forward, pushing motion, not an upward swing).


Do not use the ball of your foot to perform this strike; instead, use your heel. Be careful not to strike your foot on the doorknob.
This kicking style increases the risk of injury dramatically, because the force used is not directly perpendicular to the door, and the toes of a foot may land on the knob or lock instead of the door, which may strain the ankle or break the tendons on the heel.

, You should not hammer away at a stubborn door too many times, because this may cause too much damage to the door or your body. Try to find another way in.


Make sure you've exhausted your other options. Is there any other way to get in? Have you considered breaking a small window that you can easily replace? Take stock of your situation, and if there's no other choice, go on to the next step.
As an alternate method, you can use a hammer, sledge or other suitable pounding device to strike the area below the doorknob. A crowbar can also help with heavier doors. This is suggested for people who are not physically able to deliver a good kick.

Choose a high, broad angle for your camera.,
Mount your camera to the wall.,
Attach your camera to a power source.,
Attach a wired camera to your DVR.,
Link wireless cameras to your computer.,
Attach the monitor to the DVR.,
Troubleshoot any connection issues.",How to Install a Security Camera System for a House2," The best angle of any room is usually looking down from the corner where the ceiling meets the walls. Make sure you can clearly see all entries and exits and that the camera is near a power outlet.


If you are mounting a camera outside, place it above 10ft so that it cannot be easily knocked down., Some cameras come with sticky pads to adhere your camera to the wall, but screwing your camera in is the safest way to mount your cameras long-term. While every camera is different, most of them can be mounted the same way:


Place the mount in it's desired location.
Using a sharpie, make marks on the wall where each screw should go.
Drill a hole for each screw using an electric drill
Hammer in any molding pins.
Screw the mount into the wall.
Position the camera to your desired angle., Almost all cameras come with a power adapter that plugs into a normal wall socket. Plug the small, round end into the power input on the back of the camera and plug the other end into the outlet.


If your power adapter is missing or broken, contact your manufacturer.

, Surveillance equipment is connected using a BNC (Bayonet Neill–Concelman) connection. BNC cables are simple to use -- they are identical on both sides and you simply plug them into the appropriate port, turning a small nut on the end to lock it in place. Plug one end into your camera's ""Output"" and the other into one of the DVR ""Input"" ports.


Note which input you plug into -- this is the input your DVR must be set to in order to view your camera's video.
If your cable does not have a BNC connection you can buy a simple BNC adapter online or at a hardware store. This will slip onto the end of your cable to make it BNC compatible., Wireless cameras will come with a software disc that you need to install to view your feeds. Follow the on-screen instructions to access your cameras.Some cameras have a small receiver that attaches to your computer through a USB port. Make sure this is properly attached.
Write down your camera's IP address (ex. 192.168.0.5) if provided -- this number can be typed into any web browser to view your camera remotely.

, This connection frequently uses a BNC cable as well, but some DVR's can attach with HDMI cables or coaxial cables. Using your preferred connection, attach one end to the DVR's ""Output"" port and the other to the monitor's ""Input.""


You can hook up as many cameras as your DVR has inputs -- it will automatically record every camera you install.
Note which input you plug into-- this is the input you need to choose to see your cameras.

, Check that the camera, DVR, and monitor are all hooked up to a power supply and turned on. Make sure your cables are securely attached and that you have selected the right inputs for your DVR and monitor. Some monitors will display every camera at the same time, others have ""input"" buttons that allow you to switch between cameras.

Create a central ""surveillance hub."",
Use Siamese cables to wire your system effectively.,
Use a power supply box to power multiple cameras through one outlet.,
Attach each video cable to a separate DVR port.,
Hide your wires.,
Alternatively, call home security specialists to set up a custom system.",How to Install a Security Camera System for a House3," When you are wiring a lot of cameras at once, you'll need one simple place to bring all of the feeds together to your DVR. This should be a place that is easy to access, and where you can comfortably run wires from anywhere in the house. Attics, offices and your internet router all make good places to base your surveillance system.


You should only need one DVR for all of your cameras.

, The most common surveillance cable is a Siamese cable, named because it consists of two cables attached together. One is for power, and the other is for video. This means you will only have to run one wire through your house to set up each camera. The cable is usually sold as RG59 or RG6.The braided red and black side is for power. Red is positive and black is negative.
The singular, cylindrical cable is for video. Each end will have either a BNC attachment or a coaxial cable.

, Power boxes, available online and in hardware stores for $30-$50, allow you to power your cameras through a single wall outlet. They come with multiple ports and are great for powering close-together cameras or cameras that aren't near an outlet, like attic cameras. However, you will need to run lengthy amounts of wire to attach each camera to the same box.


Always attach the cameras before hooking the box to electricity.
Make sure you buy a power supply box big enough to power each one of your cameras. They should list how many outlets they support on the box.

, Your DVR can handle multiple cameras at once, allowing you to record every room in the house with only one box. Your monitor will then display every camera, or you will have to cycle through them using the ""input"" button on your DVR.

, To have a truly professional looking system you can run your cables through the walls and towards your surveillance hub. Be sure you know the layout of your walls and the location of any pipes, cables, or studs as you begin running wires. Running cables requires you to drill a hole in the wall, then thread the cable through the walls to your DVR through open spaces in your house, usually the attic.


If you are not comfortable drilling into your walls and running cables through, call a professional carpenter or handyman to take care of the cabling.
You can also secure cables to the walls or baseboards using a staple gun.
Consider hiding cables under rugs, but tape them down so that no one accidentally trips.

, There are many home security companies that will install cameras, motion sensors, and automatic emergency calling for you, though they cost much more than a typical DIY installation. However, if you have a large house, are uncomfortable with wiring, or want extra features like motion-sensors and alarm systems, call a security firm near you.


ADT, LifeShield, Vivint, and SafeShield are larger, nationwide providers of home security systems.

Memorize the emergency telephone number.",How to Fireproof a Bedroom," The smoke alarm should be located in an easily accessible location, so that you can practice proper maintenance. You need to replace the batteries on the smoke detector every six months. Since smoke alarm sensitivity reduces with age, you should replace the alarm periodically. You should not use a smoke alarm that is older than ten years.You can test the smoke alarm by pressing the button in the middle. It is best to test it once per month.
You can see the manufacture date of the alarm by looking on the back of the device or inside the battery chamber.
There should also be a carbon monoxide detector installed in the bedroom.;
, In addition to the smoke alarm in the bedroom, there should be a smoke alarm installed just outside of the bedroom. For instance, if there is a common hallway outside of the bedroom, there should be a smoke alarm located in this location., Since many fires start in the bedroom, it is wise to have a fire extinguisher on hand. Install the extinguisher in an accessible location that is not blocked by furniture. Make sure everyone who uses the room knows where the extinguisher is located and how to use it.If you don't know how to use the fire extinguisher, you should phone your local fire department. Ask if they have any upcoming fire extinguisher training sessions., If you use space heaters in the bedroom, you should keep them away from curtains, bedding, magazines, bookcases and other flammables. Make sure the space heater is set up in a safe location, such as the middle of the room and at least three feet away from bedding and furniture.You should use the following space heater safety guidelines:Locate space heaters on flat ground, away from furniture.
You should follow the manufacturer’s instructions for the space heater.
Make sure the space heater plug is in good working condition. If it is frayed or broken, you should get rid of the heater.
Turn off the space heater when you go to sleep.
Never use the space heater when you are not in the room.
Keep space heaters away from foot traffic and doorways.
Plug the space heaters directly into the wall, rather than using extension cords.

, Electrical malfunctions are a serious fire hazard, so you should get a certified electrician to assess the wiring in the bedroom. If there are any flickering lights, warm outlets or outlets that give you a shock, you should definitely get the wiring fixed., You should avoid using too many electrical extension cords in the bedroom. You don’t want to place the extension cords under carpets or furniture, which could pose a fire risk. Instead of extension cords, you should add more wall plugs to the bedroom.If there are electrical extension cords in the room, you should make sure they are not running under any carpets, pinched between doors or underneath furniture., When you set up the bedroom, you should place the furniture in such a way that people can easily leave the room in the event of a fire. You should be able to open the door completely. There shouldn’t be any furniture blocking access to the door. Secondary exits, such as windows, should not have any furniture blocking them.For instance, you should not place shelves or dressers in the way of the door.

, Instead of leaving scarves and pants on the floor, you should store all of your clothing in a dresser or closet. If there is too much clothing on the floor, it could trip you up when you try to escape the room during a fire.You should never put clothing on top of lamps, since the lamp could light the clothing on fire.

, If you have a lot of electrical appliances in your bedroom or in an adjoining bathroom, you should avoid plugging too many into one outlet. You could cause an electrical fault, which is a serious fire hazard.To avoid overloading power outlets, follow a few simple steps:Never plug more than two appliances into one outlet.
Never piggyback extra appliances such as televisions onto extension cords.
Look at your appliance power demands to figure out how much power you are placing on an outlet. Try not to exceed 1,500 watts.
Plug your air conditioner or other big appliances directly into the wall.

, If you like to have candles in your bedroom, you should keep them away from bedding and curtains. You should only light the candles when you are in the room. Before you go to sleep, you should blow them out., A common cause of house fires is smoking. If the person inhabiting the bedroom is a smoker, they should avoid smoking in the room. Smoking in bed is especially important to avoid., Your family fire plan should outline a strategy for leaving the house in the event of a fire. You should map out all of the windows, doors or other exits from your home. You should also know where all of the smoke detectors and fire extinguishers are located. Finally, your plan should include a safe location where you can plan to meet after leaving the house in the event of a fire. For instance, you could designate a street corner or street lamp as the family meeting spot.If there is anyone in your family with mobility issues or who is older, your family fire plan should designate who is responsible for helping them exit the house in the event of a fire.
Make sure your street number is clearly visible from the street, so that the fire fighters can easily find it in the event of a fire.
If you have guests staying in the bedroom, you should share a copy of the family fire plan.

, You should practice your family fire plan both during the day and at night, so that you are ready in the event of a fire. Make sure all children and adults know how to exit their bedrooms., You should keep a flashlight and a whistle easily accessible in your bedroom, such as on a bedside table or beside the phone. In the event of a fire, you can use the flashlight and whistle to get the attention of the firefighters outside your bedroom window., There should be a landline phone, cordless phone or mobile telephone in the bedroom. If a fire breaks out during the night, you need to be able to dial the local fire station. You should have the emergency telephone number for your neighborhood saved and easily accessible on the phone.Place a sticker on your phone or bedside table with your name, address and street name. You will need this information for the emergency fire dispatcher.

, Since you may not be able to find the emergency phone number on your telephone, you should memorize it. You don’t want to be stuck in a house with a raging fire and unable to phone your local fire department.You should also memorize your address and street name, so that you can quickly give it to the emergency fire dispatcher.

Consider buying a kit.,
Buy a dent puller.,
Use other kits.,
Take the vehicle to a body shop.",How to Repair Hail Damage2," Dent repair kits can be reused depending on the kit. Consider the average amount of hail your area gets. If you frequently find dents after a hailstorm, consider buying a kit.


Dent removal kits can typically be found at your local auto supply store.

, These are simple and cheap tools that use suction to remove dents. They are one of the more common kits for users not as experienced with self repairs.

, There are other types of kits that use suction and a glue gun to remove the dents. These kits sometimes require more patience and steps, but can potentially have better results. They use an arched bridge system combined with a safe adhesive.

, If you have insurance that covers hail damage, contact your insurance company to file a claim. Dent repairs are a cheap fix, and you're guaranteed the cleanest job.


Consider asking the body shop personnel to use used parts, if needed. This will reduce your expenses."

Look at the weather.,
Examine asphalt shingles.,
Examine wood shingles.,
Inspect clay tiled roofs.,
Inspect metal roofs.",How to Repair Hail Damage3," If you were out and unaware of a hail storm, check your past weather forecast. This can be a simple confirmation of whether your property was subject to hail. Hail can damage the roof of a house just as dramatically as your vehicle.

, Hail will have a different effect to the different types of roofs. For asphalt shingles you'll notice random damage with no succinct pattern. The hail impressions will probably be black in color. You might also notice a loss of granules and the asphalt will appear shiny., Again like the asphalt shingles, hail causes random damage without a clear pattern. Look for a split in the shingle that is a brown/orange color. Also look for splits that have sharp corners or splits that have little to no deterioration around the edges., Clay tiles, also known as terra cotta roofs, commonly feature multiple fractures centered around a common impact point. The most sensitive sections of the roof are the corners and the overlays along the edges of the tiles.Clay tiles are easy to spot because they usually have a clear break.

, Metal paneled roofs will rarely be punctured by hail. This style of roof is one of the sturdiest made. They seldom become dented because of the material and its proximity to the surface below. You’ll experience functional damage if the seams or edges of the panels become damaged. This will allow moisture to seep through.Metal shingles damage much like asphalt shingles, and are much less resilient than metal panels.

"
"
Confirm the damage was hail.,
Document what you can.,
Schedule an inspection.,
Be home when they inspect.,
File your claim.",How to Repair Hail Damage4," Once you notice that your roof has been damaged, you'll need to make sure that the cause was hail. If you experience a serious storm, suspect that it hailed and potentially damaged your roof.

Inspect your roof after a storm.
Look for other indicators around your property for signs of hail.If you’re renting, contact your landlord if you suspect hail damage.

, You don't need to get a ladder and photograph your roof up close. Take pictures of your house and roof after a storm. Document the hail itself if it's available on the ground., Use a reputable roofing company to inspect your roof for a quote. Be careful choosing a roofing contractor. There are many unauthorized companies that can lead to fraud. Only deal with a ""factory-certified"" roofing contractor., Make sure you are around so you can tell them that no repairs are to be done. Reinforce that they are only there for an inspection. Request the contractor to outline with chalk any damaged areas.Listen for any noises of the roofer trying imitate hail damage onto your roof.
Don’t sign anything.

, Locate your homeowner's insurance policy. Organize all the facts and documents gathered about the specifics of the damage. You'll be assigned a claim number by your insurance company. Each insurance company handles the aftermath differently. Be sure your insurance will cover all damages before hiring a contractor."

Consider the use of sandbags to put into the low areas around your house to help keep flood water at bay.

,
Move furniture to the highest room in the house if there is a chance of flooding.

",How to Prepare Your Home for the Rainy Season," Inspect your roof twice per year to avoid costly problems that can escalate into tremendous cost.


Look for cracks along the ridge of your roof and where your shingles fold over to form the cap.
Inspect the valleys of your roof (the area of your roof with a downward slope). Make sure that the sheet metal flashing does not have any holes or rusty spots.
Make sure that you do not have any missing, loose or curled shingles. Replace any in that condition that you find as soon as possible so as to avoid moisture leaks inside your home that can weaken your wall and/or ceilings.;
, Also make sure that there are not a lot of little granules collecting in there. Granules in your gutter are a sign that your roof's coating needs to be resealed.


Make sure that you don't have any down pipe clogs.

, Inside your home, check out your ceilings to make sure that you are not experiencing signs of roof or other leakage. Be on the lookout for water rings, mold or wall or ceiling discoloration. Make any necessary repairs to fix the issue and prevent it from happening again during the upcoming rainy season.

, Make sure that both close and seal properly, and make any repairs or improvements as necessary.

,

Hurricane socks were developed to help you by being a reusable tool to soak up up one gallon of water at a time. You can even dry them out faster by putting them in your clothing washer on spin cycle.

, This will reduce the risk that they will fall during the storm and damage your home.

, If water is seeping in, you may have to have the whole thing resealed.

Check your calendar to see if you made an appointment for someone to come work on your plumbing, electric, or some other maintenance issue. You might be forgetting about plans you made with someone.;
, Try to get a glimpse of whoever’s knocking. If you don’t recognize the person on the other side of the door, don’t open it yet., Go up to a window near the door and see if you can make out whoever’s knocking. Don’t open the door if you’re not confident you know the person.If you can’t see the person knocking through a window, try to get a glimpse of their car. You might recognize it as a friend’s or family member’s vehicle, or it could have the name of a utility company or other business on it.

, If you don’t recognize the person knocking on your door, or you don’t have a peephole and you can’t see them through a window, ask who’s knocking. Stand close to the door so you can hear their response clearly. If you don’t recognize their voice or you’re still not sure who they are after they tell you, don’t open the door.For example, you can go up to the door and ask: “Who is it?” or “Can I help you?”
If you have an intercom system hooked up to your front door, use it to talk to the person knocking so you can hear them more clearly.

, Don’t answer the door unless you’re confident the person on the other side is who they say they are. If you’re not sure, ignore the knocking until the person leaves. Don’t worry about accidentally ignoring a friend or neighbor -- if it’s someone you know that needs to get in touch with you, they’ll call you on the phone., If the knocking persists or you feel like you’re in danger, call the police. Don’t answer the door until the police arrive. Let the person on the other side of the door know that you’ve contacted the police and they’re on their way.

, Don’t do this unless you have something separating you from the person knocking, as they could forcefully push themselves in once you’ve unlocked and opened the door.

, If the person knocking is someone you don’t recognize and they’re claiming to be a police officer or utility worker, ask them to show you the proper badge or paperwork to prove their identity. Grab their credentials through the crack in your door or examine them closely through the security door to see if they’re valid., Be skeptical of wrinkled or dirty uniforms. If someone is claiming to be a police officer, check to see that their police badge isn’t a fake and that they have the proper police gear like a hat, radio, and utility belt. If you see anything that looks off, call the company the person claims to be with or contact the police and ask them to verify their identity., Have them wait outside while you make the call and don’t open the door. Don’t feel pressured to let them inside while you place the call.You can say to the person outside: “I just called for an ambulance/tow truck. They’ll be here any minute to help you.”

, If you’ve determined the person outside has a valid reason for being there, go ahead and open the door. Let them in if they need to come inside, but keep an eye out for any suspicious activity once they’re in your home.

, If you notice something suspicious or your feel uncomfortable at any time after you let someone in your home, leave immediately. Go to your neighbor’s house or a safe public place and call the police.

Make sure your home is well sealed.,
Get storm updates.,
Heed warnings.",How to Prepare for a Dust Storm1," You can store most of the smaller items in a box, but a backpack or a bag would be better. When collecting items for your kit, remember that the most important things in a dust storm are fresh water, food, clean air, and warmth. Unlike a general emergency kit, the breathing protections are really key. Thus, some items you should include are:A facemask or dense cotton fabric (to protect your breathing)
Airtight goggles (to keep dust out of the eyes)
Non-perishable food
Filled water bottles (3 gallons of water per person)
First aid kit
A blanket or heavy clothes
Self powered weather radio
Flashlight and extra batteries
A list of items to collect from your home (this could include prescription medications and important papers);
, You need to be able to access your emergency supplies quickly when you get a storm warning or the storm hits. This means that your emergency supplies should be stored in a place that you can get to without a lot of trouble. For example, you could put them in a designated spot in your basement, pantry, or garage.


It's a good idea to place your emergency supplies in the space you will go to in an emergency. That way you will not need to move them in order to have access to them when taking shelter.

, Dust from a dust storm can invade your home, making it difficult to breathe even when inside. In order to avoid this if your area is prone to dust storms, make sure your house is well sealed before a storm even hits.Check door and window seals. Make sure they are not damaged and provide a good seal.
Know how to block off all your vents. This could be under-house vents or air-intake vents for your HVAC system.

, Turn on weather radios or go online and check for alerts and warnings. Be aware, though, that most dust storms come without any warnings or signs. This is why it is so important to be prepared for them if you live in an area that have them.


If no warnings or alerts are there, don't think your city is safe from dust storms.

, If you suspect a dust storm is developing then it is important to get your family inside. Hopefully this will be in to your house, where you have your emergency supplies, but it may not be. If a storm is really happening, find the closest building to you and go inside. Taking cover from a developing storm is the best way to prepare for the storm.Make sure that your pets stay indoors during a dust storm as well. If you have animals that can't come in your home, for instance animals that live in barns, try to protect them from the storm as best you can by making sure they have shelter.

Get inside if you can.,
Take shelter.,
Find protective materials.,
Cover your eyes, nose, and mouth.",How to Prepare for a Dust Storm2," Don't stay outdoors during a dust storm intentionally. If hear a dust storm warning don't ignore it. If you have any way to get inside a building, do it quickly.Well-sealed buildings are ideal but any structures that will withstand the storm and give you some protection are best.

, If you cannot get inside a building or a car, find a location that is relatively protected from the storm. This could be against the side of a building or under a piece of vegetation, whatever you can find. Just be sure to stay off roads and out of areas that may be more dangerous than helpful.


Avoid laying in ditches or dry riverbeds for protection. Dust storms are often followed by thunderstorms, so you protected area may quickly become a spot for flash flooding., Most importantly, find something to protect your breathing. If you cannot get inside, find something to breathe through before the storm hits. Ideally this would be a particulate filter mask but any dust mask or thick piece of clothing will suffice.


Cloth will not keep all particulates out of your respiratory system but it is better than nothing. It will help to keep large particulates out and will help you get the oxygen you need to breathe and survive.
Although you shouldn't, if you are determined to go outside in a severe dust storm, then you should wear a particulate filter mask and airtight goggles to protect your mouth, nose, and eyes. This will help to assure that you do not inhale the dust, which is dangerous for your health and can cause serious breathing problems and even death., Before the storm actually hits, or as soon as possible, you should cover up your face. This will allow you to keep breathing and to avoid damage to your eyes.In addition, if you have a hat or piece of clothing that you can cover your ears with, do that. Dust from a dust storm can easily get in your ears and clog them. However, don't protect your ears over protecting your eyes, nose, and mouth.

Make a car emergency kit.,
Stop driving.,
Turn your car lights off.,
Seal your car up.,
Wait the storm out.",How to Prepare for a Dust Storm3," A car dust storm emergency kit will not be as comprehensive as a home kit but it will be very important if you are caught out in a storm. A car emergency kit that will help you through a dust storm should include:Jumper cables
Flares or reflective triangle
Flashlight with extra batteries
First aid kit
Non-perishable food (such as protein rich energy bars)
Water
Basic toolkit (pliers, wrench, screwdriver)
Radio (battery or hand cranked)
Blankets or sleeping bags (or simply extra layers of clothes)
Charged cell phone and car charger

, It is not safe to drive in a large dust storm. Instead of continuing to drive in the storm, find a close spot to park that is as protected as possible. Pull off the road as far as possible, turn off your car, and make sure your windows are all closed.If you are not in a spot that you can pull off, make sure your lights are on, honk your horn continuously, and use the center lane line as a guide. Do this until you can find a place to pull off the road.

, While it seems like a good idea to show other vehicles where you are located by turning your lights on, it's not. Drivers coming from behind may think that you are on the road and your lights will actually lead them off of it.Instead of leaving your lights on, just make sure your car is totally off the road. This will protect you better and will help to protect the safety of other drivers.

, Make sure all windows and doors are closed as soon as you can. In a big dust storm, dust may get into your car through the vents, so it's also important to close them all as well.In a really severe storm, with strong winds, you may even need to place a piece of fabric or tape over the vents so that dust doesn't seep into the car. The goal is to keep dust out as much as you can.

, Most dust storms are very brief. It is a good idea to wait the storm out instead of getting jumpy and trying to change locations. The odds are that you will be stuck in your car for a very short time and it is much better to be in the car than to be out in the storm.

Stop the fire before it starts.,
Turn off power to the electrical system.,
Use a Class C-rated extinguisher if you cannot cut the power to the source.,
Use a Class A or dry chemical extinguisher if you have cut the power.,
Use a fire blanket to smother the fire.,
Use water to extinguish the fire.,
Call 911.",How to Extinguish a Fire at the Initial Stages1," The majority of electrical fires stem from faulty electrical wiring or poor maintenance of electrical systems. To stop an electrical fire before it starts, do not overload electrical outlets and ensure that all electrical work is performed to code by a licensed electrician.Also keep electrical systems clear of dust, trash, and spider webs, which can all lead to fires.You should also use circuit breakers and fuses as often as possible, which are easy steps to take in order to stop a power surge from starting a fire.;
, If an electrical system begins sparking or a fire ignites at a wire, appliance, or outlet, then cutting the power to the system is the first, best step to take.If the source is only sparking or the flame has not yet spread at all, this step alone may be enough to extinguish the flame.


You should cut the power at the breaker box rather than turning off the wall switch connected to the outlet.If the problem stems from wiring or an appliance, do not simply pull the plug on the device. The electrical problem occurring could very well be creating an electrocution hazard as well.

, The acceptable type of fire extinguisher in this situation depends entirely upon if you are able to cut the power to the source or not. If you don’t know where the breaker is, the box is locked, or it would simply take way too long to access, then you must use a Class C-rated fire extinguisher.Class C extinguishers are either carbon dioxide (CO2) or dry chemical extinguishers, and they will specifically include “Class C” on the label on the canister.To use the extinguisher, pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle, point the horn at the base of the fire, and hold down the handle.As you see the flames shrinking, approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911.
Since the faulty wiring is still receiving power in this case, the fire can reignite. You should still cut power to the source as soon as possible.
You must use a Class C extinguisher because they contain non-conductive substances. A Class A extinguisher will only contain highly pressurized water, which conducts electricity and can create electrocution risks.Another way to identify CO2 and dry chemical extinguishers is by their red coloring (water extinguishers are silver). CO2 extinguishers also have a hard horn at the tip instead of just a hose, and they lack a pressure gauge., If you are able to cut the power to the source completely, then you have turned the Class C electrical fire into a standard Class A fire.In this case, you can use a water-based Class A extinguisher in addition to the previously mentioned extinguishers.


Class A extinguishers and multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers are actually recommended in this scenario because CO2 extinguishers run a higher risk of the fire smoldering and reigniting once the CO2 dissipates.CO2 extinguishers can also cause respiratory problems in confined spaces such as houses or small offices., Alternatively, you can use a fire blanket to smother the fire, but this step is only applicable if you were able to turn off the power to the source completely. Though wool (most fire blankets are chemically treated wool) is a good insulator of electricity, you still don’t want to get close enough to the source and risk electrocution if the power remains on.


To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire.
Not only is this very effective in the early stages but does not damage surrounding area or objects.

, If you don’t have any type of fire extinguisher or fire blanket around, then you can use water; however, ONLY use water if you have 100% turned the power to the source OFF. Otherwise you not only risk electrocution, but also spreading around the electricity, which can spread the fire much more quickly. Throw the water at the base or seat of the fire.


Water at the speed you can draw it from a sink will only be effective if the fire is very small and contained. Otherwise, it will spread faster than you can douse it.

, Even if the fire is out, you should still call 911.Smoldering objects can reignite, and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely.

Move immediately to an underground shelter whenever possible.,
If unable to go underground, stay in a windowless, interior room on the lowest possible floor.,
Know where NOT to seek shelter.,
Remain in your shelter until the danger of tornadoes has passed.,
Exit your shelter carefully, and exercise caution moving around in a tornado stricken area.",How to Survive a Tornado1," At the first sign of a tornado, or if a tornado warning has been issued, stop whatever you're doing and seek appropriate shelter immediately, even if you don't see a tornado. A warning, as opposed to a watch, means an actual tornado has been sighted.


An underground tornado shelter or a specially designed tornado safe room is the safest place to be during a tornado. Some homes, businesses, and schools in areas prone to tornadoes have these shelters.
If a tornado shelter is not available, go to the basement of a building. Stay away from windows, and cover yourself with a mattress, cushions, or sleeping bags. If possible, get under a heavy table, which can protect you from falling debris.;
, In a building with no basement, avoid windows and go to the lowest floor and seek shelter in a small room that is located near the center of the house, under a stairwell, or in an interior hallway with no windows. Bathrooms can be particularly effective because they are fortified by pipes and you can lie in a bathtub. Regardless of where you are, crouch low to the ground or lie down, face down and cover your head with your hands and arms. Take cover under a strong table if possible, and cover yourself with a mattress, cushions, or blankets.


Stay out of elevators, as you could be trapped in them if power is lost. Instead, use the stairs to descend to the lowest floor.

, Not all hiding spots are created equally. The following locations should be your absolute last resort during a tornado, as they all have the potential to be severely damaged by high winds.


Mobile homes
Tall buildings
Open rooms with lots of windows
Buildings with flat, wide roofs (cafeterias, gyms, etc.), If possible, listen for advisories from the National Weather Service (in the U.S.) and Environment Canada on a NOAA weather radio or on local radio or TV. Keep in mind that multiple tornadoes often form in an area, and it may not be safe to leave shelter even after one tornado has passed., After a tornado strikes, you are likely to encounter hazards such as flooding, falling debris, collapsing buildings, and blocked roads. Avoid fallen power lines and puddles with wires in them, and avoid using matches or lighters in case of natural gas or fuel tank leaks. Be alert and proceed with caution, as there may be sharp objects scattered about the ground. Do not enter damaged buildings under any circumstances, as they may be prone to collapse."
"
Shut off the fuel supply.,
Use a fire blanket to smother the fire.,
Use a Class B fire extinguisher.,
Call 911.",How to Extinguish a Fire at the Initial Stages2," In applicable situations, the first thing you should do for fires involving flammable liquids is to turn the fuel supply off.For instance, if a static discharge ignites gasoline around a fuel pump, the first thing you should do is hit the emergency shutoff valve located nearby at all pumping stations. This act severs the small fire from the very large fuel sources around it.


In many instances where the flammable liquid is the only fuel source, the fire may extinguish itself as soon as you cut the fuel supply.

, You can also use a fire blanket on small Class B fires. If a fire blanket is readily available, this can be the easiest, least damaging method to extinguish it.


To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire.
Ensure the fire is not too large for the blanket to smother it. Vegetable oil igniting in a frying pan, for instance, is a small enough fire for a fire blanket.

, As with electrical fires, water-based (Class A) fire extinguishers should not be used on liquid or oil fires. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and dry chemical fire extinguishers will have a Class B rating.Check the label on the extinguisher and ensure that it says Class B before using it on a flammable liquid fire.


To use the extinguisher, pull any pin stopping you from depressing the handle, point the horn at the base of the fire, and hold down the handle.As you see the flames shrinking, approach the source and continue spraying until the fire is fully extinguished.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911.
The only exception to this rule when the liquid fire stems from vegetable oil or animal fats in commercial-size deep fryers and other restaurant equipment. The large size and extreme heat and fuel source of these devices get their own classification for fire extinguishers—Class K extinguishers.Restaurants with this type of equipment are legally required to keep a Class K extinguisher present.Do NOT throw water on liquid or oil fires. Water does not mix with the oil. When they are together, the oil stays on top of the water. The water will then boil and become steam 'very quickly.’ This quick boil is dangerous. Since the water is on the bottom of the oil, it sprays hot, burning oil in every direction as it boils off and evaporates. This then spreads the fire very quickly.

, Even if the fire is out, you should still call 911.Smoldering objects can reignite, and proper firefighters will be able to isolate and remove any risks completely.

"
"
Use a fire blanket to extinguish the fire.,
Use a Class A fire extinguisher on the fire.,
Use plenty of water.,
Call 911.",How to Extinguish a Fire at the Initial Stages3," If the fuel source for the fire is a solid combustible material—wood, cloth, paper, rubber, plastic, etc.—then you have a Class A fire.A fire blanket is a quick, easy way to extinguish the initial stage of a Class A fire. The fire blanket removes oxygen from the fire, which starves the fire of it’s ability to burn.


To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire.

, If you do not have a fire blanket handy, then you can easily use a fire extinguisher on a Class A fire. Ensure that the label on the extinguisher reads Class A.To use the extinguisher, aim at the base of the fire and sweep the spray back and forth across it until it’s out.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911.
Solely Class A extinguishers will be silver and will have a pressure gauge for the water inside; however, many multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers will also be rated for Class A fires.You can use a carbon dioxide (CO2) extinguisher on Class A fires if it’s the only type of extinguisher you have, but it’s not recommended. Class A objects tend to smolder for a long time, and the fire can very easily reignite as the CO2 dissipates.

, A specifically Class A fire extinguisher is essentially water under pressure, so you can use large amounts of water from a sink if it’s the only thing you have available. If the fire is obviously spreading faster than you can douse it—or if it’s producing too much smoke for you to try safely—then you must evacuate the space and call 911 instead.

, As with any type of fire, you can to call 911 even if you manage to extinguish the fire. Emergency responders will ensure that the fire has no chance of reigniting.

Know the warning signs of potential tornadoes.,
Drive, if possible, to the nearest shelter.,
Stay in your car if there is absolutely no other structure nearby.,
Find a low spot relative to your current position if caught totally in the open.,
Stay away from overpasses, bridges, or areas with potential for lots of debris.,
If caught on open water, move perpendicular to the direction of the tornado.",How to Survive a Tornado2," Being able to quickly determine your risk is one of the key steps to finding shelter and surviving. Unfortunately, there are few proven ways to stay safe in the open if caught in a tornado, and the number one advice is to find shelter as soon as you see these warning signs. Most tornadoes are accompanied by thunderstorms, hail, and, of course, high winds, but there are other things to look out for as well:


Dark, green-tinted clouds
Loud roaring noises, like airplanes taking off
""Wall clouds,"" where the base of a thunderhead seems to lower
Funnels or rotating clouds
Debris and dust ""walls."", If you hear the warning and it is still safe to drive, get to the closest building you can find. Keep your seat belt on and get off the open road as soon as you can. Turn on your high beams and move immediately to some sort of structure, preferably with a basement. You are almost always better off in a building than in your car.


If you can see the tornado and/or flying debris makes driving dangerous, stay put.

If your car is pelted with debris while driving, this is your cue to pull over.
Never try to out-drive a tornado in an urban environment -- get to any building as shelter instead.

, Fasten your seat-belt and duck down below the window line. Take your coat, a blanket, a pillow, etc. and put it over your head and back, and hold your hands over your head to protect your brain. Stay put until you can safely drive to shelter., If there is a low ditch nearby, and you have no other options, hop in. Lay face down and cover the back of your head with your hands. If you can, cover your whole body with a blanket or similar covering to prevent scratches from debris., Falling and spinning debris is the cause of most tornado fatalities. While being caught in the open is not ideal, try to hunker down in a spot without the potential for lots of structural damage or fast moving debris. If torn between an overpass or an open area, choose the open space and try to get as low as possible., Waterspouts, tornadoes that form over water, pose a special problem. While they are generally weaker and slower than tornadoes on land, it's not possible to seek shelter on the open water. If waterspouts have been sighted in the area, get out of the water, if possible. If you're in the water when a waterspout hits, experts recommend trying to avoid it by sailing at right angles to its path, not straight away from it.


If a waterspout is about to hit the boat, it's probably best to dive overboard, as you then have a better chance of avoiding injury from flying debris.
If you are on land and a waterspout is very close to shore, you are not necessarily safe. While they rarely come on land, they can. Treat them like any other tornado and get to cover in case they come on land.

Put together a tornado emergency kit and stash it in your safe room.,
Learn how to turn off the gas in your house.,
Clean your lawn of potentially dangerous debris.,
Consider building a tornado shelter if you live in a high-risk area.",How to Survive a Tornado3," A tornado watch means that there is a threat of tornadoes within your area and that you should keep an eye on the news. A tornado warning is much more serious. Tornado warnings mean that a sign of rotation has been detected and that you should take immediate action depending on the tornado's location and its predicted track.Whenever you see a tornado watch, keep the news and radio on for further news.
Whenever you see a tornado warning, get to cover immediately.

, Have this plan in place and practiced before you need it. Everyone you live with should know exactly which room of the house to go to in the event of a tornado. Make sure that this room is stocked with all necessary provisions.


Note the places in each room where you should seek cover if you cannot escape, like under tables or cabinets.
Are there any places where you would be trapped or in extra danger, such as upstairs rooms? Are there ways to make them safe, such as stashing a cheap rope ladder?
Do you have first aid kits, crowbars, fire extinguishers or other special equipment around the house that people should know how to find?, This should contain all the basics for survival in the worst-case scenario, and can be used as a general emergency kit for most natural disasters.



First-Aid

Gauze, antibiotic wipes, pain relievers, bandages, broad-spectrum antibiotic, necessary prescriptions, adhesive tape, diarrhea medicine, bar of soap



Food and Water

1 gallon (4 liters) for each person in house, canned goods, cracker packs, and other non-perishables



General

Scissors, writing materials, flashlights, battery-operated radio, extra batteries, pocket knife, plastic bags, needle and thread, Major disasters can crack gas pipes and lead to incredibly dangerous leaks. If you smell gas, you need to be able to immediately switch off the utilities to protect you and your house from flammable gasses. Call your gas provider if you have any questions.

, Cut away dead or damaged tree branches that could be ripped off in high winds, and tie down, secure, or move in lawn furniture. Keeping your lawn clean is about more than looks. Dead branches, decorations, and lawn chairs will be whipped at 100's of miles an hour in the event of a tornado, slamming them into your stuff. Keep your lawn free of anything that could turn into a weapon when picked up by a tornado., If tornadoes are a regular part of your local weather, buying or building a shelter is well-worth the cost. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has produced a guide to building a shelter yourself as well.

Gravel and concrete on the ground help create a break line, such as driveways and patios. You can also use small, fire-retardant plants that grow close to the ground.Some fire-resistant plants include California lilac, ornamental strawberry, yellow ice plant, French lavender, and California Fuchsia. Look for plants that are low-resin and high in moisture content.Try to make a break of 100 feet around your home. This area should be composed of concrete and spaced-out plants (use mulch).Focus especially on any area that moves uphill towards your house, as that's where fire is most likely to strike.
Clear around other structures, too, such as sheds, making sure to clean out the undergrowth.;
, If a firetruck can't get to your home, firefighters can't put the fire out. A firetruck needs a solid road to get your house, including your driveway, so you need to ensure that even your driveway is solid enough to sustain a firetruck. It also helps to have a good place to turn the truck around. In addition, think about anything that blocks access, such as a gate. It's best to leave access open if you're in a fire-prone area., Many old materials, such as wood, burn more quickly. However, you can find many designs that are more fire resistant. For instance, some houses use concrete panels that have foam in the middle, which are much more fire resistant., While the main material you build with is in important, you also need to pay attention to the materials you use for your roof and siding. For instance, you can use tile, metal, and even concrete on your roof or brick, stucco, or stone for siding.If you must have a wood roof, make sure the shingles have been painted with a fire-resistant treatment., Many houses use wooden window frames, but that can be a way for fire to enter your house. Instead, use metal frames, which are more flame resistant. Having double-paned glass can also help., Because wood is a cheap building material, it's often used for decks. However, that can be a way for a fire to attach to your home. Instead, try tile, concrete, brick, or stone for deck, which are more fire resistant., Embers from a fire can travel a long ways, as much as a mile. They can land on your roof. If you have debris up there, it can catch on fire, even if your roof is made of flame-resistant materials. Cleaning out your gutters regularly is a good idea.Also, have your chimney cleaned once a year to check for soot buildup., If you have power lines above your home or nearby, you need to check to make sure they won't be brought down by tree limbs. All tree limbs should be kept trimmed back from the power line.Look for limbs that hang above your power lines or that are starting to grow between the power lines. Most power companies will come and trim the trees for you.

, The more stuff you have in your home, the easier it is for a fire to spread. Go through your house, and make sure you're only keeping the stuff that is useful to you, whether for a utilitarian purpose or for design purposes. For instance, if you have clothes you haven't worn in a year, it's time to toss or donate them., Candles can be a fire hazard, as they can be knocked over. The flame can also spread to nearby fabrics or something could fall on top of it. Instead, try using oil diffusers, such as bamboo sticks, or even opt for a wax-warming system. Electrical sources can also cause fires, but they're generally more safe than open flames., Every time you do the laundry, try to clean out your dryer lint. Dryer lint is one of the leading causes of fires in the home. Therefore, make sure you clean it out regularly, at least every four to six loads., If you're constantly tripping the breaker or blowing a fuse, you either have something wrong with your electrical system or you are overloading your outlet. Try putting less on that outlet, and if you still have a problem, you need to call an electrician.Bad electrical systems can lead to fires.
Also, don't run cords under rugs., If a lamp or other electronic appliance sparks, makes funny noises, or smells funny, it's best to replace it. Faulty appliances could lead to fires in your home, as they could send out sparks that start a fire., Light bulbs in lamps and nightlights can get hot enough to set things on fire, particularly fabric. Make sure nothing is too close to the bulb part of a lamp, particularly things like drapes or bed sheets., Space heaters, particularly the older kind with open heating elements, can be dangerous. Keep anything flammable well away from a heater, and make sure that the heater is not in a place where it could be knocked over by a pet or child., Smoke alarms cut your family's risk of dying in a fire by half. You should have one in every bedroom, as well as one on each floor of your house. Place the detectors high on the wall or on the ceiling, as the smoke will rise to them., You should check your fire alarms twice a year to make sure they're working. If they're not, you'll need to change the battery. If you have a fire alarm connected to your electrical system, you may need to call an electrician to get it fixed., If you don't already, make sure to keep at least one fire extinguisher in your house. A good place to keep one is in the kitchen, as that is where many fires start. Make sure it is handy and accessible to everyone in the house and that everyone who is old enough knows how to use it.You should also have a fire extinguisher on each floor if you have a multi-story home., Before a fire ever happens, you should know the best ways to get out of your house. Try to have at least two ways to get out of every room. Also, check to make sure your escape routes are viable. For instance, you may not be able to get out of a window if it doesn't open.Also, make a designated meeting spot for your family, such as the mailbox, when there's an emergency like a fire.

, Fire ladders, made of a material like aluminum, can help you escape in case of a fire from a second-story window. Adults should operate fire ladders, so put them in rooms accessible by adults who can help children out."

Have an escape plan and practice it.,
Plan around the abilities of everyone in your household.,
Stay low and crawl to an exit to avoid smoke inhalation.,
Feel doorknobs to see if they’re hot.,
Don’t hide in the event of a fire.,
Know what to do if your escape routes are blocked.",How to Escape from a Fire1," Prepare for the worst by developing a fire escape plan and making sure everyone in your household knows what to do in case of a fire. Your plan should identify all available exits from each room and routes that lead from the room to a safe, open-air space. Designate a meeting space away from your house, such as a neighbor’s yard or a mailbox across the street.It’s important that your exit routes do not lead to a closed-in area that would prevent escape away from your home, like a gated courtyard. It’s best that any gates or fences can be easily unlocked or unlatched from inside.Make sure everyone in your household knows how to unlock or unlatch any doors, windows, gates, or fences. Routinely inspect any and all of these potential obstacles to be sure they will actually provide a means of escape in the event of a fire.
Practice your plan every few months, including at night, which is when fires are most deadly since it’s more difficult to find a safe exit.;
, When making an escape plan, take any handicaps or abilities into account. If you or someone in your household depends on glasses or hearing aids and will need them in order to find their way out, make sure they’re always on a nightstand or other handy spot. Make sure wheelchairs, canes, and other means of mobility assistance are by their user’s bed or easily accessible.It’s best for anyone with mobility issues to sleep on the ground level of a multi-story home.
Contact your local fire service’s non-emergency number and tell them about anyone in your household with special needs that should be kept on file., Stay as low to the ground as possible while you swiftly make your way to the nearest exit, especially if there is smoke in the area you’re located. Smoke inhalation can cause you to lose consciousness, and the freshest air will be closest to the ground since smoke and toxic chemicals rise. In addition, staying low below smoke will increase your ability to clearly see your escape path., Never open a door if the doorknob feels hot. That means there’s most likely a fire behind it, and opening the door will put you in danger and fuel the fire with oxygen. If your primary means of escape is blocked by a hot doorknob or other obvious sign of fire, find an alternate route or a window.Use the back of your hand to feel doorknobs, rather than your palm. The thinner skin on the back of your hand is more sensitive to heat, so you’ll notice heat before getting burned.
Open any doors you come across slowly and be prepare to quickly shut it in case you encounter fire or smoke.

, Even if you’re scared, it’s most important never to hide under a bed, in the closet, or anywhere else during a fire. If you hide during a fire, firefighters or other responders won’t know where you are. Try not to panic, and do your best to remain calm and make your way to the nearest way out of your house., If all possible exits are blocked, it’s important that you do everything you can to let any emergency responders know where you are. If you have a phone handy, call emergency services to let them know your exact location. Yell for help, shine a flashlight at a window, or find a light colored cloth or clothing item to signal out the window.


If you are stuck in a room, cover all vents, close the door and put a towel, clothes, or anything on hand that can suitably cover any cracks around it. This will help keep smoke and fire from entering the room.

Leave when local officials recommend that leaving is safest to do.,
Evacuate if your house is located in an area known to be prone to flooding.

,
Evacuate if you live where storm surge damage is known to occur.,
Evacuate if your home is not safe.,
Put your health and safety above all else.",How to Determine if You Should Evacuate Before a Hurricane," Definitely leave if they make an order for evacuation; such an order should never be ignored.On some occasions, you may be ordered to stay at home, where officials consider that this is safer than leaving.;
,, If you live on a barrier island, and your portion of the island is known for storm surge damage, evacuate ahead of a hurricane.

, If your home lacks hurricane reinforcing, is a mobile, manufactured or modular home, and it's in a coastal or storm surge area, consider evacuating.


Realize that even if your house is considered safe and weathers the hurricane, the aftermath of a hurricane in your area may be devastating. Getting out and about may be very difficult and even dangerous. Loss of power and water, and an inability to get supplies, can make staying treacherous––survival is longer than the actual storm event.

, Where possible, evacuate the persons who are most vulnerable. This includes babies, children, teens, the frail elderly, pregnant women, persons with an illness and people with high levels of anxiety.

Know evacuation routes and procedures.,
Take the stairs.,
Take into consideration any mobility issues.,
Keep keys and key cards handy.",How to Escape from a Fire2," Whether you live in apartment building, are staying in a hotel, or work in a tall building, familiarize yourself with its floorplan and evacuation routes. Know the shortest and fastest path to the nearest stairwell, and know where any alternative exit routes is located. Talk to the building’s superintendent or management personnel about specific emergency procedures., Never take an elevator in the event of a fire emergency. Every now and then, practice taking the stairs if you live in an apartment building or work in a high rise. Make sure you’re familiar with how many flights there are and how long it takes to descend the stairwell. Use handrails and step to the right (or to the appropriate side as determined by your building’s emergency protocol) to make room for any emergency responders ascending the stairwell.


Turn back if you notice smoke coming from lower levels of a staircase. If possible, make your way to the building’s roof. Keep the door to the roof open to help clear smoke from the lower levels of the staircase, which will help those who might be incapacitated and allow emergency responders easier access.Once on the roof, make your way upwind (walk in the direction the wind is blowing), call emergency services if you haven’t already done so, and let them know your exact location.

, Tell your building’s management personnel about any potential difficulty you or someone in your office or household by have escaping via a stairwell.


If you use a wheelchair and cannot use a stairwell, try to find someone in the immediate area who can assist or carry you down the stairs. Call your local fire department's non-emergency number ahead of time to let them know about your mobility requirements in the event of a fire.
If there is no elevator available and you're stuck on an upper floor, let emergency services know your exact your location and create window signals using any available means.

, If you’re staying at a hotel, be sure to keep your key card handy as you evacuate your room and floor. In the event that the hallway or stairwells are blocked, you’ll need to return to your room, seal off any cracks around your door, cover vents, and use a flashlight or light article of clothing to signal your location in the window.Remember to check your room’s doorknob before you exit in case there is a fire in the hallway.
If you work in a high rise office, follow similar procedures in case all means of exit are blocked. Close your office or suite’s door, and make sure it’s unlocked or keep your keys or key card handy if it locks automatically.

Move downhill and upwind.,
Search for an area without combustible material.,
Find or dig a trench if escape is not possible.,
Practice safe hiking and camping practices.,
Evacuate as soon as you’re ordered to if a wildfire threatens your home.",How to Escape from a Fire3," Hot masses of air that rise cause wildfires to travel uphill, and walking uphill will slow you down anyway. Move into the direction that the wind is blowing, and locate this direction by looking to see where smoke is blowing.Try to look high in the sky for the direction of the smoke’s travel.
Look for the direction that leaves and branches are swaying.

, Once you’ve set your direction of downhill and upwind travel, look for a natural firebreak. A firebreak is an area that has comparatively less material for the fire to consume, like a rocky area or field of boulders, road, body of water, or patch of large trees that might retain more moisture than other nearby foliage.Steer clear of open areas with small, dry shrubs or bushes.

, If you cannot escape to a safer location, look for a trench or gully. If you find such an enclosure, try to quickly dig it out to create a space deep enough for you to fit your body. Crawl in, preferably with your feet facing the direction of the fire, and cover yourself with dirt. Make sure you can breath as you take cover.Call emergency services if you haven’t already done so. Let them know your location as precisely as you can.
If a wildfire is within close range, surrounding you, or otherwise blocks all means of downhill and upwind escape, and if no safe locations are available, you might have to resort to running through the fire’s leading edge into an area that’s already burned.

, Prevent getting stuck in a wildfire before hiking or camping by looking up assessing risks like weather conditions, extreme drought, any buildup of dry materials in your hiking or camping area, and the wind’s direction. Check with local park rangers if there is any threat of wildfire in your area.Don’t build a campfire in dry conditions, especially if your park ranger lets you know there’s a local burn ban.
If it’s safe to build a campfire, keep it small, contained, and away from trees or shrubs. Never leave it unattended.
Make sure your campfire is completely extinguished before you leave by pouring lot of water over it, stirring the ashes, pouring more water, making sure there’s no hissing sound, and lastly making sure it’s cool to the touch.

, Grab bare essentials as quickly as possible and leave immediately if you’re under a wildfire evacuation order. If you live in an area threatened by wildfires, contact your local fire department’s non-emergency line or search the internet to find out about any available email or text message alert systems.Call emergency services if you see a nearby wildfire but haven’t received an evacuation order. Don’t assume someone else has reported it.

Plan your escape route ahead of time.,
Practice your escape plan and safety rules with children often.,
Test your escape plan to be sure it works well.

,
Make sure the last person leaving each room closes the door after exiting.,
Choose a safe place outside the home where family members can meet.",How to Decide Whether It Is Safe to Escape During a Fire1," Fire spreads quickly, and there may be no time during a fire to figure out an escape route.


If bedrooms are on the second floor, be sure an escape ladder is near the window in each room.
Designate 2 escape routes out of each room.;
, When you prepare children, they are generally less frightened and can better remember what you taught them.


Walk your children through each escape route. Have them practice opening doors and pulling up windows to be certain they can easily handle these tasks.
If you have older children with bedrooms on the second floor, have them practice exiting safely through the window using the escape ladder.

,, This will help to slow the fire, giving family members a little extra time to get out safely.

, This can be a neighbor's front yard, your mailbox or another safe location.

Maintain your smoke detector.",How to Change the Batteries in Your Smoke Detector," Installing the new batteries incorrectly, or using the wrong type, will cause your smoke detector to not function. Always make sure you are using the correct type of battery and installing the batteries correctly to ensure the detector will work.


Detectors that use lithium batteries will last for ten years. You generally cannot replace the battery, instead, replace the entire detector after its ten year life span is expired.
Many detectors will make use of a 9v battery. However, some may require different types of batteries.
Use high quality, long lasting batteries. Using rechargeable or low quality batteries may cause your smoke detectors to fail.;
, You will have to take your smoke detector down from its mounting on the ceiling. If your detector is hard-wired into your house's power system, you should turn the power off at the fuse box first.


The method you use to remove your smoke detector from its mounting will vary depending on which model it is.
Most smoke detectors are removed by twisting or sliding the detector away from the mounting.
Some detectors will not require you remove the entire detector. These models require that you remove only the section that covers the internal components and battery.
Not all hard-wired smoke detectors will have a backup battery.

, To access the battery, you will have to remove the cover that contains it. Exactly where the battery is located, and how it is secured, will vary from model to model. Generally, once you remove the cover of the detector, you will be able to see where the battery is located without trouble.


The location of this cover will vary from model to model, and some may be secured with a screw or other fastening.
Most coverings will slide off and away from the smoke detector's body.
Once open, you can remove the old battery or batteries.
Make sure you install the new batteries correctly. Check that the negative and positive connections are matching the labels on the smoke detector
Close the battery cover.
Check your manual for the smoke detector if you are having trouble locating or removing the battery. If you don't have the physical copy of the manual, you may be able to find it online, at the manufacturers website.

, Before you reinstall the smoke detector, you will want to make sure that the batteries are working properly. Locate and utilize the button on your smoke detector that will test the batteries.


The location of the test button will vary.
Most test buttons require you to press the button for a few seconds to engage the test.
If successful, the alarm will sound.

, If the alarm doesn't sound during the test of the batteries, you will need to recheck them. Never reinstall your smoke detector until it passes this battery test and has demonstrated that it is functioning properly.Check to see if the batteries are installed correctly. Make sure the positive and negative terminals are matching the correct terminals in the smoke detector.
If the batteries are installed correctly, and the test failed, replace the batteries and try again with new ones.
If no new batteries are working, your detector may need replacing. You may want to contact the manufacturer, as they may replace the detector if it is under warranty.
Some alarms have an LED-light that will indicate if the alarm is working properly. Generally a green light indicates that the alarm is working properly, a red light indicates an issue.

, If you still have the manual, review the information to help you better understand your model of smoke detector and to properly maintain its functionality.


Finding where the battery is located, and how to access it, can vary from model to model.
The manual may also indicate which type of battery is required by your smoke detector.
Don't throw the manual away. Keep it in a place that you can store it safely and still access it when needed.

, Wired smoke detectors are connected directly into the power supply of your house, which is sometimes also called the mains.The battery in these detectors is intended to power the alarm in the event of a power outage. To cut power to your wired smoke detector, you'll have to press the circuit breaker in your home circuit box. This should turn turn the circuit from ""ON"" to ""OFF.""


Many homes with hard wired circuit breakers will have a breaker specifically labeled for smoke alarms. However, if you do not have a labeled breaker and cannot determine which circuit your detector is on, you can press the main breaker to cut all power to your house, including the smoke alarm.
Wired smoke detectors frequently have a small green light that indicates it is receiving power from the mains. When this light turns off, you know the power to the alarm circuit has been cut.
Cutting the power to your wired smoke alarm might seem excessive, but this extra precaution will prevent accidental shocks. This can be especially important when dealing with old or excessively dirty smoke detectors.

, Depending on the kind of smoke detector in your home, there are many different ways you might have to remove the cover for your detector. These covers are relatively simple, so through trial and error you should be able to get the cover off in less than a few minutes, though a manual might speed this process. Some common covers include:


Push-lock covers. These covers usually have a small, plastic lock that can only be opened by pushing on a specific point indicated on your fire alarm. Look for an arrow indicating the point you need to push, and use a thin screwdriver or pen to release the push-lock.
Twist-lock covers. To unfasten these you'll have to twist the cover (usually counterclockwise), or in some cases, push upwards and twist. Hold the alarm as you remove this kind of cover. Once the lock is undone, the cover will fall downwards.
Friction-lock covers. These covers are held in place by the friction of a plastic locking mechanism on the inside of your detector. These can often be popped loose by prying the cover free with your fingers using firm, moderate-light pressure., Generally, most smoke detectors use a 9-volt battery for power, though you should always follow the directions that came in your smoke detector manual. Be sure the battery is new so that it lasts the full ten-year life expectancy of most home smoke detectors.You may want to take a felt tipped marker and use it to write the date you replaced the battery on the inside of the cover. This way, if you forget when you last replaced the battery, you can easily find out by checking the inside of your cover.

, Use the opposite procedure you used to remove your smoke detector cover to fit it back into place. This will likely involve either twisting the cover clockwise or pressing it until the friction/push locks snap into place. Then you should return power to the circuit by pressing the same breaker you initially pressed to cut power. Once the cover is on, follow your smoke detector user manual to test your battery.


Most smoke detectors have a button on the center of the cover. In many cases, to test your smoke detector, all you need to do is press this button for five seconds. You should hear a chirping noise if your battery is good and properly installed.
If you find that, no matter how you fit your battery into place inside your smoke detector, the detector still will not give a test-chirp, try another battery. If this battery does not work, you may need to install a new smoke detector., By installing a smoke detector and keeping it in working order, you will greatly increase your chances of saving your property and life in the event of a fire. By not having a functioning smoke detector, you are taking an unnecessary risk.You increase your chances of property loss by 57% by not having a working smoke detector.
Chances of injury increase by 26% if your smoke detector isn't functioning.
By not having a smoke detector installed, you are four times more likely to die in a fire.
Smoke alarms are not present in three out of five house fire deaths.
A properly working smoke alarm will reduce the chance of death in a house fire by 50%.

, There are two main types of smoke detector, both of which detect fires using different methods. It is recommended that you install both types in your home or find a model that functions as both in one.The two types of smoke detectors are photoelectric and ionization based detectors.
Photoelectric detectors use light to detect smoke, while ionization detectors utilize radiation sensors to register smoke.Some smoke detectors combine both photoelectric and ionization into one detector.
There are special smoke alarms for the hearing impaired. These generally use a bright, flashing strobe light instead of an audible alarm.
Certain smoke detectors can communicate with each other. If one is triggered, all detectors will sound their alarms.

, A smoke detector is a great investment, and many types of smoke detectors are affordable. If you need to replace old detectors, or install new ones, knowing the price ahead of time can help you budget properly for a detector.Ionization or photoelectric based detectors usually start at around $6.
Models that include both ionization an photoelectric in one start at $24.
Some detectors come with a microprocessor, for better and faster detection, and start at $30.
Wireless smoke detectors start at $40.

, You may have smoke detectors installed in your home, however, they may not be placed in ideal locations. Strategically installing your smoke detectors will increase their functionality, allowing them to alert you sooner in the event of a fire.


Install at least one smoke detector per floor in your home.Bedrooms should have their own smoke detector installed.
Any hallways that lead to bedrooms should also have their own detector installed.
Most smoke detectors should be placed on the ceiling, as smoke rises. If this isn't an option, place the detector as high up on your wall as you can.
Any directly wired smoke detector should be installed by a professional electrician to avoid improper installation.

, Having a smoke detector installed is only the first step in fire safety. You will need to properly maintain your smoke detector in order to make sure you are protected by it. Perform regular checks and replacement of batteries to ensure your protection.For any standard 9v battery powered detector, test monthly, replace the battery yearly, and replace the detector every ten years.
For a long-life battery detector, test the alarm monthly and replace the detector according to your manufacturer's instruction. Most of these are built to last for ten years.
For a detector that is directly wired into your homes electrical system, test it monthly and replace the detector every ten years. Replace the backup battery at least once a year.
Dust or vacuum your smoke detectors to keep them functioning at their best.

Clean your smoke detector regularly.,
Clear insects from the alarm.,
Connect alarms as separate units.,
Tighten electrical connections.,
Install fire alarms away from furnaces and ovens.,
Minimize exposure to cold air returns.,
Position alarm in dry areas.,
Be aware of areas with exhaust gases or open flames.,
Replace the batteries.,
Test smoke detectors properly several times a year.",How to Avoid False Alarms With Your Smoke Alarm1," Any dust or dirt that covers your smoke detector or its internal sensor chamber can set it off when there is no fire. By cleaning the unit every couple of weeks, you may minimize the number of false alarms you experience or avoid them altogether.Make sure to dust or clean not only the outside cover of your unit, but also inside the cover, where dust often accumulates.You can use a dusting brush or vacuum the alarm with the soft brush attachment.If you are in a new home or having construction done, make sure that the electricians use a dust cover to keep the alarm from gathering debris.;
, Insects may get caught in your alarm because they are attracted to the sound or even light that the unit may emit. If the alarm is going off with no smoke or visible fire, check for and for insects on the cover or sensor chamber., If you have an interconnected system of fire alarms, a unit in another part of your home may be triggering connected fire alarms. Keep alarms on separate electrical currents to help prevent them from triggering one another.If your units are connected and there is no way to separate them from a power source, make sure to check for smoke so that you are sure there is no fire.
Power interruptions may also trigger the alarm, especially if you live in an area where utility companies switch the grids., If your smoke alarm is on an AC or AC/DC electrical system, make sure to tighten any loose connections. This can help the unit avoid chirping or going off fully.Loose hot wire connections may occasionally disconnect power, which has the same effect as a power outage.If you are unsure of the wiring, contact an electrician to help you.

, Furnaces and ovens not only produce combustion particles that may trigger the alarm, but they also may smoke because of oil and residue. Installing your fire alarms at least 10 feet from a furnace or oven may minimize the number of false alarms you experience.Furnaces can blow debris in ductwork into your smoke alarm and make it go off.You may notice more false alarms in the fall when you first begin using the furnace after the summer., Areas that experience cold air returns, which suck cold air back into a furnace, are more susceptible to false alarms. Keeping your alarm away from cold air returns may prevent dusty air from blowing through the alarm and keep it from going into alarm mode.Place the alarm at least 10 feet from a cold air return., Places in your home that may have high humidity, such as the bathroom or kitchen, are more susceptible to false alarms. Installing the smoke alarm at least 10 feet from high humidity areas.Install the alarm at least 10 feet from showers, laundry rooms, and kitchen sinks or dishwashers., Places in your home, such as the garage, workroom, or living room may emit exhaust gasses or flames that can trigger an alarm. Avoiding placing your smoke alarm in areas exposed to exhaust gases or open flames may help minimize or prevent false alarms. Note that in some areas heat detectors are required in garages. Contact your local fire department for more information.


Do not locate smoke detectors near a fireplace or other open flame heating systems such as oil & gas furnaces.

, One of the most common causes of false smoke alarms is a weak battery. A chirping noise means that the battery is weak, and needs to be replaced. Replace batteries regularly, such as twice a year, to help prevent false alarms and the annoyance of consistent chirping., Electronic devices can fail at any time, so maintaining and testing them can help ensure proper function. Regular testing can help prevent a fire or damage to your home or family.Press the test button on the smoke detector. It may take a few seconds, but you should hear a loud and ear-piercing siren while the button is depressed.If there is no sound or weak sound, replace your batteries.Ask a family member to go into the farthest room from the alarm to make sure that anyone in the house can hear it.Light a match and blow it out directly under the alarm. After that, place the match in a glass of watch and make sure it’s extinguished. If the alarm doesn’t go off, you may need new batteries, new wiring, or a new unit."

Monitor indoor air quality.,
Contact your local fire department to ensure your home is up to code.",How to Avoid False Alarms With Your Smoke Alarm2," Because smoke alarms can be so finicky and are not optimal in every are of your home, it’s a good idea to consider alternative methods to detecting smoke or fire. This can help ensure that your home is fully protected from fire or smoke and may minimize the number of unpleasant false alarms.


Most fire alarms in the United States fall into two categories: photoelectric and ionization models. Ionization models are better at detecting flaming fires, while photoelectric models react more quickly to smoldering fires.
Although most homes have ionization models, most experts consider the photoelectric detector to be more effective.You can get dual models that may minimize false alarms., Technological developments have produced smoke alarms that are wireless and can alert every one in the house if there is smoke present. Purchase wireless alarms to prevent nuisance alarms and help avoid problems with power sources.Wireless alarms are especially useful for multi-level homes., Some new thermostats are “smart” and include heat detectors that can sense significant changes in temperature that may indicate a fire. Position this type of detector in areas that experience shifts in temperature or humidity.The heat detector is useful in rooms such as the kitchen, bathroom, and laundry room.Some heat detectors will allow you to turn off the alarm with a wave of your hand., Carbon monoxide is a dangerous and colorless gas that can kill you. Although it doesn’t cause fires, carbon monoxide, or CO, is often near places where there are fires. Consider employing a carbon monoxide detector in your home to help prevent death or potentially detect conditions rife for fire.Consider purchasing a combination CO/ smoke detector., There are many things, such as dust or weather, that can affect the air quality in your home and either set off false smoke alarms or cause fires. Watching the air quality in your home may help prevent false alarms and buildup of chemicals or gases that can cause fires.Most indoor air quality monitors test for temperature, relatively humidity, and carbon dioxide, or CO2., They can provide information on where devices should be located, what type of devices to use in each location, and even come to your house to perform an inspection."

Determine where the extinguisher will be used.,
Decide what type of fires may be encountered in that location and choose the correct classification of extinguisher.,
Choose an appropriate sized extinguisher.,
Once you have chosen the appropriate extinguisher, make sure to place it in an accessible location and that everyone in the house knows how to properly operate it.",How to Choose a Fire Extinguisher For the Home," Is it going to be used in a garage, kitchen, or just a general location in the house? This will help you determine the type and size of extinguisher required.;
, In the United States, there are 5 classifications.


A - Ordinary combustibles such as paper and wood.






B - Flammable liquids and gases such as gasoline.






C - Electrical fires which includes any energized electrical objects.






D - Combustible metals such as magnesium.






K - Oils and greases found in a kitchen fire.






Many extinguishers have multiple classifications, the most common being ABC. These are rated for A, B, and C classifications though they may not be as effective at each as a more specialized extinguisher. The label should have a number indicating the rating for each classification, such as 5-A, 10-B. The higher the number, the better.







, Take into consideration where it will be stored, who will be using it, and the potential size of the fire in that location. For example you may want a larger extinguisher in a garage which contains many flammable substances, whereas a smaller one may be appropriate for use in a cooking fire. Remember that children may have difficulty using a heavier extinguisher.

, It is also important to read and understand the necessary maintenance steps for your extinguisher. Failure to maintain the extinguisher may result in it being inoperable when you need it.

How soon after a fire you are allowed back in the building will depend on the severity of the fire and the measures employed to put the fire out.


Assess the damage to your belongings once you are back inside. Decide what you want to try to clean, and what you need to discard.;
, As soon as possible, open windows in each room for increased ventilation and bring in a small fan to increase the amount of air flow into the room. This will help clear the building of any residual smoke, minimize the smoke odor, and provide fresh and soot-free air for you to breathe.


Run a dehumidifier with the windows closed if you live in a climate with warm, humid weather and have associated water damage along with smoke damage. In this situation, multiple powerful fans will be key.
Change your furnace filter daily if your heat is running. Do this until it the filter shows no soot., Fans and dehumidifiers will help with this task. However, if water hoses were used to put out the fire, it may be best to hire professionals to do fire/water damage combination cleanup.


Contact your insurance company for approved restoration contractors that you can contact.
Visit the Better Business Bureau website or Angie’s list to find trustworthy contractors.
If you attempt to dry out your house yourself, beware of any mold or mildew underneath beneath carpets and floors. Remove all carpets from the home. The presence of mold can be a serious health risk and can damage your floors beyond repair.
If possible, invest in some large swamp fans to help dry and air out your home.

, Combining harsh fumes from smoke with cleaning products can irritate your lungs, so make sure you have the windows open (if possible) and fans running to bring fresh air to the area in which you are working.

, Especially when cleaning your ceiling, safety goggles will prevent you getting soot in your eyes, while rubber gloves will protect your hands from cleaning chemicals. In addition, try to wear old clothes that you doing mind getting stained and ruined. A hat will protect your hair from dust and soot.

, This will help to avoid transferring soot stains to the carpet or flooring.

, The first step to cleaning smoke damage is to remove any loose soot clinging to the walls. This can be done with a vacuum cleaner or with a dry chemical sponge.


Fix the plain attachment onto the vacuum cleaner hose, and hold the nozzle slightly above the surface of the wall. Move it back and forth until all loose soot is removed. You may also want to try using the brush attachment to brush off any additional soot. Anything that is not sucked into your vacuum cleaner should fall on to your drop cloth.
Try a dry chemical sponge as an alternative to vacuuming.This chemical sponge is highly recommended because it is impregnated with a chemical that removes soot and smoke from your wall.Using a dry sponge, wipe the soot stain on the wall repeatedly. When the sponge becomes saturated with soot, wash it out in a sink and allow to air dry.
If there is severe soot damage on walls or ceilings, they may need to be replaced.

, A popular cleaner for smoke-damaged walls is Trisodium Phosphate (TSP). While this is a more powerful cleaning solution, it still requires a great deal of time and effort to clean the damage to your walls and/or ceiling.


Put on a pair of heavy duty gloves to protect your hands and forearms and a pair of goggles to protect your eyes. Wear old clothes that you don’t mind having ruined.
Fill a standard bucket with 1 gallon warm water and add 1 tablespoon of TSP.
Wet a sponge with the TSP solution and wipe your wall or ceiling vigorously with the sponge. Work one section at a time.
Rinse the section you have just cleaned with a rag dipped in clean water.
Continue until the entire wall and/or ceiling has been cleaned.
Repeat the wash/rinse step several times depending on the severity of the soot buildup. Be cautious not to oversaturate your walls with water or let the water seep between your walls and baseboards.
If the smoke damage is still visible after this cleaning process, you will likely need to prime your walls and/or ceiling and repaint.However, it is important to make sure they are as clean as possible before you do so.
Beware that TSP is a harsh cleaner and can have irritating effects to skin and eyes. Be careful not to allow it to touch your skin, and if it does, wash it off immediately and be on the lookout for severe irritation., There are many good commercial cleaning products designed to remove soot from walls as well as other surfaces. You can choose solutions that are heavy-duty for severe smoke damage, or that are gentle enough to be used around children and pets. A simple online search will provide many options, but here are some suggestions to start with:


Unsmoke Degrease-All Degreaser: tough enough to remove the heaviest smoke damage.
Benefect Atomic Degreaser: a solvent-free, high-performance botanical degreaser, safe for use around people and pets.
Chemspec Smoke-Solv Liquid Wall Wash: specially formulated to remove soot and smoke residue from walls and hard surfaces.

, After you clean off the soot, you will need to deal with the smoke odor. Walls can absorb smoke and leak it back into the room.Several common household items, or those found easily in grocery stores, can be used to remove the stubborn smoke odor from the walls of your home, even if they don’t appear smoky or dirty at first. Place a plastic sheet around the base of the walls to avoid water seeping in between the walls and baseboards.
Fill a bucket with warm water and add a few tablespoons of detergent, just enough so you create a few bubbles.. Wipe down walls with soapy water using a soft cloth or sponge.
Use white vinegar as an alternative. Try wiping down washable walls with white vinegar (this can also be used on furniture and floors). Vinegar, while strong smelling itself, can be used as a powerful odor-neutralizer.
Spray walls and surrounding area with Febreeze. Febreeze, sold in many stores, uses cyclodextrin to absorb odor. Try spraying the walls and affected area down with Febreeze to reduce smoke odor. The smell of Febreeze will be a welcome change from the odor of smoke!

, While professional smoke damage repair can be costly and potentially unfriendly to the environment, there are companies that will employ environmentally-friendly smoke removal procedures.


Look in the yellow pages or online under “Fire and Water Damage Restoration.”

, Hold the vacuum cleaner nozzle slightly above the surface of the upholstery, drapes, or carpet and move it back and forth across the item.Soot is oily and stains very easily so it will need to be removed as soon as possible, before any further cleaning or deodorizing occurs.


Do not use vacuum attachments or an upright vacuum. The brushes tend to force soot further into fabrics and will make them much more difficult to clean. An upright vacuum will ground the soot into the fabric or carpet.

, After the soot is removed from the surface of any furniture and textiles, you will want to deodorize these items. While professional assistance is recommended to make sure that the smoke odor is completely removed from these items, it is possible to attempt to deodorize them yourself using at-home methods.


Dissolve 1 cup of dishwashing detergent in 1 gallon of warm water. Completely submerge all items (including furniture covers, curtains, etc.) and let them soak overnight in a washing machine or bathtub. Drain them and launder as usual the next day.For items that can be bleached, mix 4-6 tablespoons TSP with 1 cup Lysol or household bleach and 1 gallon of water. Add textile items, rinse with clear water, and dry.For especially stubborn odors, call a professional who will do an ozone treatment. This deodorizing treatment actually breaks up the smoke molecules to eliminate the order. This can be done by a professional fire restorer with an ozone generator.Talk to a local dry cleaner about using counteractants. Tell them that there has been smoke damage, and they can use these chemicals to remove odors from your textiles and clothing., After deodorizing, you will want to thoroughly clean all textiles. Take anything that is non-washable (including most draperies) to a dry cleaner for traditional dry cleaning.


Wash any machine-washable items in warm water using your normal liquid detergent. Several washings may be needed to get these items as clean as possible.

, After your carpets are fully dry, professional cleaning (which may need to be done twice, once after the fire to remove the soot and once after the rest of the restoration processes have taken place in the house) will help to make them as clean as possible. In some cases, you will need to remove the carpet because of mildew or mold on the floorboards underneath. It is highly recommended that you leave the carpet cleaning to the professionals to fully deodorize and rid your carpets of smoke damage.

, Any clothing with burn holes or severe damage should be discarded.


Sort clothes into piles based on their fabric types and washing instructions.
Beware of any clothing that are dry-clean only, as these must be professionally treated.

, This can be done by taking clothing outside and giving it a gentle shake or by attaching the plain attachment to your vacuum cleaner and running it just over the surface of the clothing.


Never use the brush attachment with your vacuum cleaner if removing the soot from clothing. The brush bristles can force particles of soot deeper into the clothing.

, Controlled research has shown that fire damaged clothing is best cleaned by different methods according to the fabric content.Using a specific cleaning method tailored to the fabric content of your clothing will help salvage as much clothing as possible. Visibly smoke damaged clothing should be fully restored after 5 launderings.


Use liquid detergent to return clothes to original state if they are 65/35 polyester-cotton blend, 50/50 polyester-cotton blend, or pure cotton.
Use powder detergent and bleach (for bleachable clothing only) for clothing that is 65/35 polyester-cotton blend, 50/50 polyester-cotton blend, or pure cotton.
Be aware that dry cleaning is non-effective with clothing that is 65/35 polyester-cotton blend, 50/50 polyester-cotton blend, or pure cotton.
Recognize that 100% polyester fabrics may never be fully returned to their original state.

, After your clothing is restored to its original appearance, it may still have a residual smoke odor. Washing your clothes in warm water with different detergents for 1-5 launderings can help you remove this smell.Use powder detergent or liquid detergent (with our without bleach) to get the smoke odor out of any type of washable clothing.
Avoid using household deodorizers to remove the smell. These will only temporarily mask the smell.

, It will not fully remove the smoke odor from clothing. It is better to wash any clothing that is able to be washed yourself where you can put different items through as many washes as necessary to restore them to their original quality.


That said, some dry cleaners can use special counteractants to remove odors from clothing. Talk to your dry cleaner to see if this option is available., They will be able to perform an ozone treatment on your clothes that will destroy the smoke molecule and the smell as well.

, You will want to treat your wood furniture gently to avoid stripping off the finish or causing any permanent damage.


Vacuum the soot off the furniture using a flat attachment. Do not rub the attachment along the wood, as this can grind soot into the wood. If your wood furniture is finished, you can consider using the brush attachment and gently rubbing the bristles along the surface of the furniture.
Wipe the wood with a dry chemical sponge. This is similar to the process of removing soot from the walls. Wipe the dry sponge along the surface of the wood in straight lines until the sponge turns black with soot. Rinse the sponge and let it dry.
Restore the wood with polish. Use a cream restoration polish for best results, and do not leave the cream on the wood for more than 5-10 minutes. Consider using a polish like Restore It Cream Furniture Polish. You can also use a spray like Pledge.

, Cleaning leather furniture can be tricky because it must be treated gently and cannot be shampooed like a fabric. Using a gentle deodorizer can help you effectively remove the smoke smell from your leather furniture.


Vacuum the soot off the furniture using a flat attachment. Do not rub the attachment along the surface of the leather furniture, as this can grind the soot in to the furniture further.
Apply saddle soap or leather soap to a clean cloth and wipe the leather with it. Follow the instructions on the bottle for best results.
Spray the leather with a half-vinegar half-water mixture mixed in a spray bottle. Because you cannot shampoo leather, this is your best bet for removing an odor.Wipe off this mixture, and then wipe furniture with a clean damp rag. Do not saturate the leather.
Steam cleaning can also be effective for leather furniture. You can buy a steam cleaner for your home or hire professionals to do it for you.
Sprinkle baking soda liberally over the leather and allow it to sit overnight. Vacuum it up in the morning, and repeat if needed.
Remember to clean each cushion and pillow separately if your furniture has removable pieces.

, Non-washable fabric furniture can stubbornly harbor smoke smells. You will want to clean these pieces of furniture as soon as possible as they will slowly leak the smoke smell into the rest of your house.


If any fabric coverings can be removed from the furniture, do so. It is easiest to clean the smoke smell away in a washing machine.. You can also add 1 cup of white vinegar to the washing water in order to increase the power of odor removal.
Sprinkle baking soda with a little bit of salt over the entire surface of the affected furniture. Baking soda is a well-known odor absorber.Allow the baking soda to sit for 1-2 days.
Vacuum the baking soda away using the basic attachment on your vacuum cleaner.
Repeat until the odor is removed.
Consider purchasing a product called Odor Check by Watkins. This product is specifically found to work well for removing smoke smells."

Get everybody out first.,
Use a fire extinguisher for small, contained fires only.,

Use the right fire extinguisher.",How to Use a Fire Extinguisher," Evacuate everybody from the building. Tell somebody to call the fire department or emergency services once that person is safely outside. Even if you're able to extinguish the fire on your own, it’s best to have the fire department on the way in case something happens.When the fire department arrives, they can check that the fire has been extinguished properly.;
, Before you use a fire extinguisher to put out a fire, it’s important to take a couple safety precautions. Locate the nearest exit, and position yourself so your back is toward the exit. This will make it easy for you to escape if you have to leave quickly in an emergency.Keep your back toward the exit at all times so you know where it is and don’t get turned around or disoriented.

, Many fire extinguishers have a range of between 8 and 12 feet (2.4 to 3.7 m). Before discharging the extinguisher, move toward or away from the fire so you're standing 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 m) away.


You can move closer once you start dousing the fire and the flames die down., Every fire extinguisher has a pin inserted into the handle that prevents the fire extinguisher from being discharged by accident. Grab the ring and pull the pin out from the side of the handle.Now that the extinguisher is ready to discharge, hold the device so the nozzle is pointed away from you.

, Hold the lower handle lever (the carrying handle) with one hand and grab the hose or nozzle with the other hand. Point the hose directly at the base of the fire, because you have to put out the fuel that’s burning. Do not aim the hose at the flames.With carbon dioxide extinguishers, keep your hands away from the plastic discharge horn, which gets extremely cold.

, To release the extinguishing agent, squeeze the two levers together with one hand while you aim the hose at the base of the fire with the other. Apply slow and even pressure when you squeeze the levers.To stop discharging the extinguisher, release the levers.

, To extinguish all the fuel, slowly sweep the hose back and forth over the base of the fire as you discharge the extinguisher. Move closer to the fire as the flames die down.Continue discharging until the fire goes out.

, Watch the fire closely to ensure the flames don’t flare up again. Back away slightly if they do. Aim the hose again, squeeze the lever, and sweep the hose across the base of the fire again to extinguish it.Never turn your back on a fire. You always want to be vigilant about where the fire is and what it’s doing.

, The average extinguisher will have enough agent inside to go for about 10 seconds. Back away and leave immediately if the fire isn't out when the extinguisher is fully discharged.Call the fire department or emergency services if they haven't already been called.

, Some fire extinguishers are disposable, and these must be discarded once their discharged. Others are rechargeable, and can be refilled with agent and re-pressurized.


Do not leave an empty fire extinguisher lying around, because somebody may try to use it in an emergency.

, You shouldn’t try to tackle a fire on your own with a fire extinguisher unless you know everybody else is safely out of the building. Also, only proceed if you can safely fight the fire and have a clear escape route.When everybody else is out of the building and you’ve determined your exits, you can return to fight the fire.

, Fire extinguishers are not meant to fight large or growing fires. Only attempt to fight a fire if the flames are shorter than you, and if the flames are contained in a small space. Evacuate immediately if the flames are taller than you, or if the fire is spreading and growing.An example of a contained fire is a wastebasket fire.

, Never try to fight a fire on your own if the room is full of smoke. Smoke inhalation can lead to unconsciousness, and you'll be stuck in the room with the fire.If there is lots of smoke in the room, cover your mouth and get down on the ground. Stay low to avoid the smoke and crawl out of the room to safety.

, Fire extinguishers are loaded with different dousing agents to fight specific classes of fires. Some types of extinguishers will be ineffective against certain classes of fires, while others could actually make the fire worse. Before trying to put out a fire, make sure you know the fire fuel, and only proceed if you have the right type of fire extinguisher.Class A: Suitable for cloth, wood, rubber, paper, various plastics, and regular combustible fires. The extinguishing agent is water or foam.

Class B: Suitable for gasoline, grease, and oil fires. The extinguishing agent is a dry chemical or carbon dioxide. Extinguishers smaller than 6 pounds (2.72 kg) are not recommended.

Class C: Suitable for energized electrical fires. The extinguishing agent is a dry chemical or carbon dioxide.

Class D: Suitable for combustible metals. The extinguishing agent is a dry powdered chemical.

Class K: Suitable for kitchen fires, including oil, grease, and fat. The extinguishing agent is a wet or dry chemical.

Class ABC: This is an all-purpose fire extinguisher that works on class A, B, and C fires. The extinguishing agent is a dry chemical.

Ensure you are sufficiently protected.",How to Test a Smoke Detector," Unless you are trying to conduct a fire drill, you should let everyone in the home know that you will be testing the smoke detector so that they will not feel frightened when the detector goes off.If your smoke detector is hardwired to a monitored security system, be sure to notify the security system's company that you are performing a test before you test the alarm. You don't want the fire department showing up at your door!;
, When testing an alarm, it will sound loud to you because you are going to be standing directly underneath it. However, you may also want to be sure that your detector is loud enough that anyone in any room in the home can hear it. Remember, it has to be loud enough to awaken the deepest sleeper in the household.Ask them to stand in the room farthest away from the detector when you are testing it. They may also try standing outside the house to see if it is possible to hear it from outside.

, Many smoke detectors are equipped with a light that indicates the unit is receiving power. However, you should still use the test button to ensure that the alarm will sound properly. You can do this by pushing and holding the test button for a few seconds.


When you push the test button, the alarm should sound. If it doesn’t, you know that your detector is not receiving power. You may need to replace the batteries, or call an electrician to check the wiring if your detector is hardwired.
You can stand on a chair or ladder to reach the alarm with your hand, or you can use a broom handle to push the button.
Some detectors will turn off on their own after a few seconds, while others may be turned off by pushing the test button again.

, In addition to making sure that the unit is receiving power properly, you will want to make sure that the detector’s smoke sensor is working correctly, too. You can purchase an inexpensive aerosol spray, which is designed specifically for testing smoke detectors. If your alarm does not sound when you use this product as directed by the manufacturer, the sensor in your detector may be worn out. If this is the case, replace your detector immediately.Follow the directions as stated on the can.
You can usually purchase these for a few dollars in a hardware or home improvement store.
To turn off the alarm after testing, you can use a small hand-held vacuum to suck the test material away from the detector. Some detectors may also have a “silence” button that you can push to stop the alarm. Avoid waiting for the detector turn off on its own, as this may drain the battery.

, You can also use real smoke to test the smoke sensor. To do this, light two or three matches, and hold them together a few feet underneath the detector. The smoke from the matches should cause the alarm to sound if the detector is functioning properly. If it doesn’t sound, replace the detector immediately.Be sure to keep the matches a few feet away from the detector, otherwise you risk melting or damaging it.
As with the aerosol, you can use a vacuum to suck the smoke away from the detector, or push the silence button if your detector has one.

, Some recommend testing your detectors each week. Obviously it is better to check them more frequently, so do it each week if you can. If you can’t, then be sure to plan a time each month to check each smoke detector.Checking your alarm often means you are likely to catch a malfunctioning detector quickly; thus, you are more likely to have a properly functioning detector when you need it.
Setting aside 30 minutes to an hour once each month to check each detector all at once will be more efficient than checking each alarm at different intervals.

, Smoke detectors can last about ten years before they may become unreliable. The sensors in the detector may wear out or become contaminated by dust and other air pollutants. Therefore, after ten years of use, it is important to replace your smoke detectors.If you aren’t sure how old your smoke detector is, you can usually find out by removing the unit from the ceiling, and looking on the back. The date of manufacture is typically printed on it.
If you can’t find the date on the unit, then replace it.
If your smoke detectors are hardwired, be sure to shut off the electricity in your home before installing a new one. Alternatively, have a professional electrician install the unit for your own safety.

, When you are testing the detector each month, it is a good idea to use a vacuum cleaner attachment, a cleaning brush, or a soft cloth to clean any dust, dirt, or other debris that may have accumulated. In the event of a fire, buildup on the detector could cause it to malfunction.Don’t use cleaners on the unit as these may contaminate the sensors. Vacuuming or wiping away dust should be sufficient.

, If you have a battery powered detector and even if it is functioning properly, it is a good idea to replace the batteries two times per year in order to make sure your detector is ready to go if and when you need it.Resist the temptation to take the batteries out of your smoke detector when the batteries in your TV remote run out. People often do this, and then forget to replace the detector batteries.

Recycle old batteries appropriately. Never dispose of old batteries in the household trash.
You might want to get in the habit of changing your batteries when you change the clocks for daylight savings time. This will help you remember when you need to change the batteries.

, It is important that everyone knows what to do in the event of a fire. Take the time to have everyone sit down together with a floor plan of your home, and create a fire exit plan that everyone will be able to use in the event of a fire. Make sure that all members of the household have memorized the emergency number for the fire department.Make sure that you have at least two escape routes out of every room. If you have a second floor, consider getting a life safety ladder that can hang from your windows.
Include a meeting point outside of the home where everyone will go in the event of a fire. For example, to the neighbor’s drive-way. Mark this location on your escape plan.
Assign one person who will be responsible for helping anyone who would not be able to get out of the home on their own. For example, if you have a baby, young toddler, or an elderly family member. Make sure this person knows that it is their responsibility.
If you have young children, post the fire exit plan in their room to help them remember what the plan is.

, Have every family member practice the exit routes from each room at least once or twice a year. Instruct each member of the household on what to do if they notice a fire.For example, if someone notices a fire they should yell or pound on the walls to alert other members of the household.
Instruct family members to feel doors before opening them. If the door is hot, they should use an alternative route as specified in the fire exit plan.
Explain that if there is heavy smoke, household members should crawl on the floor to avoid smoke inhalation.

, Inspect each door and window in your home. Are there objects that would make it difficult to get out of these exits in the event of a fire? If a fire happens, you want as many possible ways to get out of the house as possible, so make sure that there is nothing that would keep you or your loved ones from getting out safely.For example, don’t allow a tall, heavy dresser to block the window. If a fire happens, you or your loved one may not be strong enough to push it out of the way in time.

, You should conduct a fire drill at least once. Don’t tell anyone that you are setting off the alarm so that it will be treated like the real thing, rather than as a drill.Try to do this when everyone is home.
Everyone should understand that they are not to try and bring belongings with them. Once they have exited the home no one is to re-enter the home under any circumstances.

, Having one smoke detector to protect your entire home is likely insufficient, unless you live in a very small, one-room studio apartment. It will require more maintenance, but make sure that you have enough smoke detectors to protect everyone in the home, and ensure that all the smoke detectors are interconnected (e.g. that if one sounds, all the smoke detectors will sound).Install a smoke detector on every level of your home, including the basement and the attic, if your home has these.
Install a smoke detector in each room. In addition, install smoke alarms outside of every sleeping room.
